\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 24): “As I live, says the Lord, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, be a signet on My 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ right hand, from there I will remove you.” [Jeremiah further] states there (ibid. 22:30): “Inscribe this 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ man childless.” We learn that his repentance availed [Jeconiah], and Zerubbabel was born to him, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he was made as a signet.
