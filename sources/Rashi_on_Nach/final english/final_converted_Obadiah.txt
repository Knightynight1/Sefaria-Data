<b> Obadiah</b>  <b> Chapter 1</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> The vision of Obadiah</b> - Why is Obadiah different that he was chosen to prophesy concerning Edom  and did not prophesy any other prophecy? Our Sages of blessed memory stated: Obadiah was an  Edomite proselyte. Said the Holy One, blessed be He: From them and in them will I bring upon them.  Let Obadiah, who dwelt between two wicked people, Ahab and Jezebel, and did not learn from their  deeds, come and impose retribution upon Esau, who dwelt between two righteous people, Isaac and  Rebecca, and did not learn from their deeds. [from Sanhedrin  39b]  <b> 2</b>  <b> Behold I have made you small</b>  -In contrast with what his father called him, his big son, and his  mother called him her big son, the Holy One, blessed be He, says: In My eyes, he is small (Pesikta dRav Kahana  p. 56; Pesikta Rabbathi , ed. Meir Ish Shalom p. 79a; Pesikta Rabbathi  ed. Warsaw p. 144; Gen. Rabbah  65:11). And our Sages (Avodah Zarah  10a) expounded: small for they have neither script nor  language. [from Avodah Zarah  10a] <b> despised</b>  -That they did not crown a king the son of a king.  <b> 3</b>  <b> who dwell in the clefts of the rock</b>  -Who relies on the support of his ancestors, Abraham and Isaac,  but they shall not avail him. <b> the clefts</b>  Heb.  חגוי . Cf. (Isa. 19:17) And the land of Judah shall be to  Egypt for a dread  (ל חגא) , frayteyne  [or fraite ] in O.F., a cleft of a rock. And do not wonder about  the vav of (Gen. 21:16) like a shot  (כמטחוי)  ; in which there is no radical in the word but  the teth and the heth.  <b> 5</b>  <b> come upon you</b>  Heb.  באו לך , lit., came to you. <b> How were you silent?</b>  -Why were you sleeping  soundly and still until they stole all they desired? <b> grapes?</b>  -But these will not leave you anything, for they will search and reveal and seek out your  hidden things.  <b> 6</b>  <b> were revealed</b>  Heb.  נבעו . Jonathan  rendered: were revealed, and it is an Aramaic expression:  נבעו  means sought out. Cf. (Isa. 21: 12) If you will request, request  (א ם תבעיון בעיו) .  <b> 7</b>  <b> Until the border... escorted you</b>  -Those who promised to aid you, came with you and escorted you  to the border of your land, to the boundary, whence they came upon you in war, and with this they  enticed you and succeeded. <b> they prevailed against you</b>  -to entice you to leave, and they deserted  you. <b> your food they lay as a wound under you</b>  -Even your food your brother Jacob made for you as  a wound, for he gave you bread and a pottage of lentils, and thereby you despised the birthright. <b> wound</b>  Heb.  מזור .  <b> 9</b>  <b> And your mighty men shall be dismayed</b>  -They shall be dismayed and frightened to flee to the land  of Israel [Malbim : to the land of Edom]. And Jonathan  rendered: And your mighty men shall be  dismayed, dwellers of the southland. <b> in order that every man be cut off</b>  -I.e, every mighty man.  [from Targum Jonathan ] <b> from the mountain of Esau by slaughter</b>  -By the great slaughter that will  come upon them.  <b> 10</b>  <b> Because of the violence of your brother Jacob</b>  -Because of the violence you inflicted upon  Jacob.  <b> 11</b>  <b> On the day you stood from afar</b>  -that you did not come to aid him. <b> you, too, are like one of them </b> -I account it for you as though you were one of their attackers.  <b> 12</b>  <b> And you should not have looked on the day of your brother</b>  -You should not have looked and  stood from afar. <b> on the day of his being delivered</b>  Heb.  נכרו . On the day of his being delivered into  the hands of the heathens. And so does Scripture state concerning Saul: (I Sam. 23:7)   נכר אתו אלהים  בידי , He has delivered him into my hand.  <b> 13</b>  <b> and you should not have stretched out upon their possessions</b>  -You should not have stretched  out your hand upon their possessions. So did Jonathan  render. And this is an ellipsis, to which we must  add: your hands.  <b> 14</b>  <b> And you should not have stood by the gap</b>  Heb.  הפרק . The place through which the escapees  emerge to escape, and in French they call it trou. <b> And you should not have stood by me gap</b>  -From  here [we learn] that one may not interrupt between one paragraph and another in reading  the Shma. [Haggadah of Rabbi Akiva ]  <b> 16</b>  <b> For, as you drank on My Holy Mount</b>  -Just as you rejoiced concerning the destruction of My  Holy Mount. [from Jonathan ] <b> and be stunned</b>  Heb.  ילעו . As the Targum  renders:  ויסתלעמון , an  expression of confusion, amazement, and benumbing the mind; etourdissant in French -stunning.  <b> 17</b>  <b> those who inherited them</b>  -The possessions of the people who inherited them. [from Targum Jonathan ]  <b> 18</b>  <b> for the Lord has spoken</b>  -Now where did He speak? (Num. 24:19) Out of Jacob shall come a  ruler, and he shall destroy him that remains in the city. [from Mechilta Bo  12:16, Pirk&dRabbi Eliezer  ch.  37]  <b> 19</b>  <b> And [the inhabitants of] the southland shall inherit</b>  -Israel, who were dwelling in the south of  Eretz Israel, shall inherit the mountain of Esau, which is at the southern boundary; and the people of  the plain shall inherit the land of the Philistines and Mt. Ephraim and Mt. Shomeron. <b> with [the inhabitants of] Gilead</b>  And the children of Manasseh, whose territory was the land of  Gilead, shall spread beyond the borders of Eretz Israel on the east.  <b> 20</b>  <b> And this exiled host</b>  Heb.  החל . Jonathan  renders: This people.  החל , An expression of a host. Cf. (Isa.  36:2) And he came (sic) to Jerusalem with an army  (חיל)  of a great multitude, which deals with  Rabshakeh, only that this one is missing a yud. It is also possible to explain  גלת החל  as the exile of  this valley. <b> who are [with] the Canaanites as far as Zarephath</b>  -The exile which is of the children  of Israel who were exiled from the ten tribes to the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath <b> exile of Jerusalem which is in Sepharad</b>  -who are of the people of Judah who were exiled to  Sepharad - they shall inherit the cities of the southland, which are in the southern part of Eretz Israel.  The exegetes claim that Zarephath is the kingdom called France in French. <b> Sepharad</b>  - Jonathan  renders: Spain.  <b> 21</b>  <b> shall ascend</b>  -Princes of Israel as saviors on Mt. Zion. <b> to judge the mountain of Esau</b>  -to exact  retribution from the mountain of Esau for what they did to Israel. <b> to judge</b>  Heb.  לשפט . joustiser  in O.F. <b> the mountain of Esau</b>  - Jonathan  renders: the great city of Esau. <b> kingdom</b>  -This teaches you that His kingdom will not be complete until He exacts retribution from  Amalek.
