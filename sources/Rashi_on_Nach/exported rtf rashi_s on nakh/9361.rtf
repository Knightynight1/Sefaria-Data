\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ To tell you that on the day that Nebuchadnezzar entered the Heichal in the days of Jehoiachin, his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ adversary, Darius, was born (Seder Olam ch. 28). From the exile of Jeconiah until now were sixty-two 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ years, and the master said: They were exiled in the days of Jehoiachin in the seventh year counting 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from the conquest of Jehoiakim, which is eight years after the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ There remained to Nebuchadnezzar’s reign thirty-seven years, for he reigned forty-five years, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ twenty-three of Evil-merodach’s, as our Sages stated in Tractate Megillah (11b), and the two years of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Belshazzar that passed, totaling sixty-two.
