\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ one from the other, [i.e., the part of the staves extending eastward equaled the part extending 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ westward]. The staves that Moses made were still there, and they stood in the Holy of Holies of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Tent of Meeting, which was only ten [cubits], whereas this was twenty [cubits], and it reached from 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wall to wall. With the cherubim of Moses, about which it is also written, ìspreading and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ covering,î they did not have to move any part of the staves from their place, because the cherubim of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Moses were standing over the Ark on the Ark cover, but as for the cherubim mentioned here-Solomon 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ made them standing on their feet on the ground, but nevertheless, those of Moses were still attached to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the Ark cover. This is how Rabbi Nathan explained it, (but our Rabbi explained) that the priests 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wished to bring the Ark into the Debir with its staves, but they were unable to do so, because the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Cloud filled the House of the Lord, and they could not bring the cherubim up to the western wall. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Therefore, they [the staves] protruded into the dividing curtain. To me, this poses a difficulty, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ however, because it is written (I Kings 8:10f.): ìAnd it came to pass when the priests came out, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ etc.,î and afterwards, ìthe glory of the Lord filled the House of God (sic).î (Rabbi Joseph of blessed 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ memory, however, explained) that it does not say \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Â«ÈÃƒ˙¿‡»¯¿ÎÂÃ\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  [in the reflexive conjugation], which would 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ mean that they became elongated by themselves, but \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Â«ÈÃ«‡¬¯ƒÈÎÂÃ\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  [in the causative conjugation], which 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ means that others elongated them, and he explained that the craftsmen elongated them to twenty 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cubits, and their two ends touched the eastern wall and their [other] two ends touched the western 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wall. It is, however, puzzling how they could spread out their wings and cover the Ark, which was ten 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cubits from them.
