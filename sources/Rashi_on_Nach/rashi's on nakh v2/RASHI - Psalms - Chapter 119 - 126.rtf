\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ understand, and I shall know Your testimonies, to know a time to do for Your name. What should they 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ do, those who made Your Torah void, to find good will and forgiveness, and that You should be found 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ by them, and I will do so for every transgression that I have committed. Our Rabbis, however, derived 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from it [from this verse] that we may transgress the words of the Torah in order to make a fence and a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wall [a safeguard] for Israel, e.g. Gideon and Elijah on Mount Carmel, who sacrificed on high places 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Ber. 63a). I saw [it] further expounded upon in the Aggadah (Yerushalmi Ber. 9:4, Mid. Sam 1:1) as 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ meaning: A person who is idle and leisurely, who devotes [only occasional] times to his Torah, makes 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ void the covenant, for an idle person must toil in the Torah all hours of the day.
