\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ there were two. Otherwise, I do not know what it means. Some are inclined to say that Hanamel was 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ both Jeremiah’s uncle and his uncle’s son; e.g. Reuben married the daughter of his brother Simon, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ she bore him Jemuel, and Simon had already begotten Jamin. Hence, Jamin is Jemuel’s uncle, since he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is his mother’s brother, and also his uncle’s son, since he is the son of Simon, Jemuel’s father’s 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ brother. This is, however, not the method of expression, for we do not find anywhere in the Bible, that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the mother’s brother is called an uncle.
