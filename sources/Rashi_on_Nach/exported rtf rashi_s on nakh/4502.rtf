\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ staircase, fiz in Old French. This is a stone structure similar to a pillar, with steps winding around it. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ It seems to the person who is ascending upon it that he is encircling a stone pillar. In German it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ called a wendelstein. This is what is [meant when it is] stated regarding Solomonís Temple (I Kings 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 6:8): ìand upon winding stairs \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ÏÂÃÏƒÈÌ)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  they went up into the middle [chamber].î That too is translated

The spiral 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ staircase continued to wind higher and higher up to the roof of the uppermost cell, as he proceeds to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ explain, [so] that the spiral staircase ascended from the nethermost cell to the middle one and from 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the middle one to the uppermost one. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ for the encompassing of the House\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  to the cells. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ went upward

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ said, ìAnd it became wider and it wound higher and higher.î The widest part of the House within the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cells was above. The uppermost [cell] was wider than all of them. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and so, [from] the nethermost 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Jonathan rendered: ìAnd so, with the spiral staircase they would ascend from the nethermost to the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ uppermost through the middle one.î And so they would ascend with the spiral staircase from the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ nethermost one to the uppermost one by way of the middle one.
