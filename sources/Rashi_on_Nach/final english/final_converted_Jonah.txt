<b> Jonah</b>  <b> Chapter 1</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> and proclaim against</b>  -My proclamation.  <b> 3</b>  <b> to flee to Tarshish</b>  -I.e, to a sea named Tarshish, which is outside the Holy Land. He said, I will  flee to the sea, for the Shechinah does not rest outside the Holy Land. Said the Holy One, blessed be  He, to him, By your life, I have messengers like you to send after you and fetch you from there. This  is illustrated by an allegory of a priests slave who fled from his master and entered a cemetery  [making it impossible for his master to retrieve him]. His master said to him, I have slaves like you to  send after you and fetch you from there. Now what did Jonah see that he did not wish to go to  Nineveh? He said, The gentiles are quick to repent. Should I prophesy to them and they repent, I will  be found condemning Israel, who do not heed the words of the prophets. [from Mechilta , Exodus 12:1] <b> and he paid its hire</b>  -He paid its hire in advance; although it is not customary for those embarking  upon the sea to pay the hire of the ship until they leave, he paid in advance. [Pirk&dRabbi Eliezer , ch.  10; Tanhuma , Vayikra  8].  <b> 4</b>  <b> threatened to be broken</b>  -It appears as though it would be broken.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And the sailors</b>  -The men who conducted the ship. <b> each one... to his god</b>  -Of the seventy nations of  the heathens were there.  <b> 6</b>  <b> The captain</b>  Heb.  רב החובל , the captain of the sailors, for they, too, are called  חובלי הים , the sailors  of the sea; in O.F., gobernedors . <b> What is the matter with you, sleeper?</b>  -What is the matter with you  to be sound asleep? Now is no time to sleep. <b> will think</b>  Heb.  יתעשת , an expression of thought. Cf. (Ps.  146:4) his thoughts  (עשתנתיו) . (Dan. 6:4) And the king thought  ((עשית)) . [from Machberet Menachem  p.139]  <b> 7</b>  <b> Come, lets cast lots</b>  -They saw that the other ships were sailing in the sea calmly, and theirs was  breaking. They said, Because of one of us, this is taking place. So we find in Pirk&dRabbi Eliezer  (ch.  10). <b> because of whom</b>  Heb.  בשלמי , because of the deeds of which one of us.  <b> 8</b>  <b> Tell us now, because of whom</b>  -Against whom have you sinned, that this evil should befall us  because of it <b> What is your work</b>  -Perhaps you were negligent in your work. <b> come?</b>  Perhaps a decree has been issued upon the people of that place even if you are not there. <b> from what people are you?</b>  -Perhaps your people have sinned.  <b> 10</b>  <b> What is this that you have done?</b>  -Why have you done this, to flee from before such a Ruler?  <b> 13</b>  <b> And the men rowed vigorously</b>  Heb.  ויחתרו , they toiled and busied themselves like one who digs  a tunnel.  <b> 14</b>  <b> for the life of this man</b>  -I.e, for the sin of laying a hand upon his life.  <b> 16</b>  <b> and they made vows</b>  -that they would proselytize.   <b> Chapter 2</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> [And the Lord appointed</b>  -Those sixteen days that Israel was missing the manna, since they did not  eat it for a complete forty years - God took this manna and sustained the fish so that Jonah would not  be digested in its intestines, and Jonah, too, ate within it from this manna. Therefore, it is stated  וימן ,  the letters  מן   י"ו  sixteen [days of] manna. Similarly,  וימן קיקיון , and He appointed a kikayon, for he  ate four omers; therefore, it says four times  וימן  (4:6 ff.). And in Greek, manna is called kika. For  that reason, it is stated:  קיק יון  ; i.e, manna in Greek. -[Sod Mesharim ] <b> a huge fish</b>  -It was a male, and  he stood there with room, so that he did not think to pray. The Holy One, blessed he He, hinted to the  fish, and it spewed him out into the mouth of a female, which was full of embryos, and it was crowded  there, and he prayed there, as it is said: (verse 2) from the belly of the fish  (הדגה) . [from Pirk&dRabbi Eliezer  ch. 10, according to Yalkut Shimoni  ; Midrash Yonah , second version, Otzar Medrashim  p.  219]  <b> 2</b>  <b> [the Lord his God</b>  -He combined the Divine standard of justice with the Divine standard of mercy,  the merit of Abraham and Isaac. <b> from the belly of the fish</b>  -This is Jacob. [Sod Mesharim ]  <b> 3</b>  <b> from the belly of the grave</b>  -From the belly of the fish, which is to me as the grave.  <b> 4</b>  <b> all Your breakers and Your waves</b>  -All the breakers of the sea, since it breaks and parts the sea.  [from Jonathan ]  <b> 5</b>  <b> And I said</b>  -when they cast me into the sea, Behold I am dead, and I have been driven away from  before Your eyes. <b> Instead</b>  -I saw that You have kept me alive all these days. I know that I will  continue to gaze upon Your Holy Temple.  <b> 6</b>  <b> the Red Sea hangs over my head</b>  Lit., reeds are bound to my head. [Jonathan  renders:] The Red Sea  hangs over my head. For the Holy One, blessed he He, showed him the Red [lit., Reed] Sea and how  Israel crossed in its midst, for the fishs two eyes were like two windows, and he would look and see  everything in the sea. [from Pirk&dRabbi Eliezer  ch. 10]  <b> 7</b>  <b> To the bottoms of the mountains I descended</b>  -To the end of the measure of the mountains fixed to  the deep, I descended. And I said... <b> the earth - its bars are closed on me</b>  Heb.  בעדי , against me,  over me it is closed, and I will never go out. <b> closed on me</b>  Heb.  בעדי . cf. (II Kings 4:4) And you  shall close the door about yourself  (בעדך) . And so is every instance of  בעד  in Scriptures, e.g. (Job:  24) Skin against  (בעד)  skin, a limb against a limb. <b> forever</b>  This refers to what he said above, And I  said, I have been driven away, and I said, The earth - its bars are closed on me forever. <b> brought up my life from Gehinnom</b>  -But I saw Gehinnom here, and from there You brought me up,  and, behold, I stand under the Temple in Jerusalem, similar to what is stated: Indeed, I will continue  to gaze upon Your Holy Temple, And my prayer came to You, to Your Holy Temple. [from Pirk&dRabbi Eliezer  ch. 10]  <b> 8</b>  <b> When my soul grew faint</b>  Heb.  בהתעטף . [Jonathan  renders:] When it grew faint. Cf. (Lam. 2:  11) For the infants swoon  (בעטף) , (verse 12) When they swoon  (בהתעטפם)  like wounded men.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Those who keep worthless futilities</b>  -The nations of the world, who worship idols. <b> kindness</b>  -The fear of the Holy One, blessed be He, from Whom all their kindness and benefit  emanate, they abandon; but I am not so, but with a voice of thanks will I sacrifice to You. In this  manner did Jonathan  render it. But in Pirk&dRabbi Eliezer  (ch. 10), they expounded this as an allusion to  the sailors who abandoned their kindness that they were bestowing upon the idols and proselytized.  <b> 10</b>  <b> for the salvation of the Lord</b>  -Vows of peace-offerings and thanksgiving offerings I will pay, for  the salvation of the Lord. <b> for the salvation</b>  Heb.  ישועתה , like  לישועה , for the salvation. Cf. (Ps. 44:  27) Rise for our aid  (עזרתה) , equivalent to  לעזרה    <b> Chapter 3</b>  <b> 4</b>  <b> overturned</b>  Destroyed. [He did not say, Destroyed, because overturned has two meanings, bad  and good. If they do not repent, it will be destroyed; if they repent, then overturned refers to the  people of Nineveh, that they will be changed from bad to good, and they will repent. Gloss of Rabbi  Akiva(?)]  <b> 6</b>  <b> his royal robe</b>  Heb.  אדרתו , the cloak of his honor.  <b> 7</b>  <b> And he caused it to be proclaimed</b>  Heb.  ויזעק , he commanded to proclaim <b> king and his nobles</b>  -By the counsel of the king and his nobles, they commanded to announce.  <b> 8</b>  <b> and they shall call mightily to God</b>  -They bound the dams alone and the young alone. They said to  Him, Lord of the world! If You have no pity on us, we will not have pity on these. [See Taanith  16a]  <b> 9</b>  <b> Whoever knows</b>  -the sins he has committed, shall repent. <b> and God will relent</b>  -He will think about  the evil to repent of it.   <b> Chapter 4</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Now it displeased Jonah</b>  -He said, Now the nations will say that I am a false prophet. [from Pirk&dRabbi Eliezer  ch. 10]  <b> 2</b>  <b> was this not my contention</b>  -I know that, if they repent, You will not destroy them, and I will  appear to them as a liar.  <b> 6</b>  <b> appointed</b>  Heb.  וימן , an expression of preparation. [from Jonathan ] <b> discomfort</b>  -From the heat of the sun. <b> kikayon</b>  -A plant that grows high with many branches and it  affords shade and that is its name.  <b> 7</b>  <b> attacked</b>  Heb.  ותך . The worm attacked the kikayon. Where one would say for masculine  ויך , he  struck, he says for feminine  ותך , she struck.  <b> 8</b>  <b> stilling</b>  Heb.  חרישית . Our Sages say: When it blows, it silences all the winds because of it, and it is  very hot. So does Jonathan  render: silencing. [from Gittin  31b] <b> and he fainted</b>  Heb.  ויתעלף , pasmer  (pamer ), in O.F.  <b> 10</b>  <b> for which you did not toil</b>  -with plowing, sowing, or watering. <b> one night</b>  Heb.  בן-לילה , lit., one  night old, like  בן לילה .
