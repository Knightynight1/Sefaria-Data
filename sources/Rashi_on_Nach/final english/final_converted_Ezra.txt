<b> Ezra</b>  <b> Chapter 1</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> And in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia</b>  This book is arranged as a continuation of the  Book of Daniel, as is explained in Baba Bathra (15a), and the word  [ובשנת]  refers back from this  [book] to that one, for it is stated in Daniel (9:2): In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, contemplated  the calculations of the number of the years that the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah the  prophet from the destruction of Jerusalem, seventy years. And so the entire chapter proceeds to  relate [the story] of the destruction of the Temple, the time of the Babylonian exile, and his  confession, in which he confessed Israels sin. The beginning of this book is as follows: After  Belshazzar was assassinated, Darius the Mede reigned, as it says (Dan. 6:1): And Darius the Mede  received the kingdom etc. and after Darius death, this Cyrus, the king of Persia, reigned, and in the  first year of his reign, the seventy years for the remembrance of the Babylonian exile, [counting] from  the day that Jehoiakim was exiled, were completed, as it says (Jer. 29:10): At the completion of  seventy years of Babylon, I will remember you etc. When Israel returned from the Babylonian exile  to the land of Israel, in that year, in the first year of Cyrus, Israel laid the foundation of the Temple,  and the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin slandered them to Cyrus, the king of Persia, and he  commanded [them] to curtail the work, no longer to build the edifice of the Temple; and the Israelites  were idle, for they did not build the Temple during the entire reign of Cyrus and Ahasuerus, who  succeeded him, until the second year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, the king of Persia, who was  Darius, the son of Esther. And in the second year of his reign, they began building the Temple until the  building was completed. And from the first year of Cyrus until the second year of Darius, the son of  Ahasuerus the king of Persia, in whose days the Temple was built, were eighteen years, to fulfill what  was said (Dan. 9:2): from the destruction of Jerusalem, seventy years etc. And now, in the second  year of Darius, seventy years had elapsed since the destruction of Jerusalem; [i.e.,] the destruction of  the Temple, when Zedekiah was exiled. From the exile of Jehoiakim until the exile of Zedekiah, when  the Temple was destroyed, were eighteen years, and now in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia,  seventy years since the exile of Jehoiakim, when Israel was exiled to Babylon, were completed, and  thereby the verse that states (Jer. 29:10): for at the completion of seventy years of Babylon I will  remember you etc. was fulfilled. And this is the remembrance, that Israel returned to their soil and  built the foundation of the building of the Temple, although it was not yet completed. We find that  there were fifty-two years from the exile of Zedekiah, when the Temple was destroyed, until the first  year of Cyrus, the king of Persia; and eighteen years after the first year of Cyrus, which is the second  year of Darius, when Israel commenced to build the edifice, and they completed it. This is proven in  Seder Olam (ch. 29), in Tractate Megillah (11b) and in this book, as I explained. <b> the word of the Lord from the mouth of Jeremiah</b>  at the time that the word of the Holy One,  blessed be He, which Jeremiah spoke, was completed, as it says (Jer. 29:10): for at the completion of  seventy years of Babylon etc. <b> the Lord aroused the spirit</b>  the will. <b> a proclamation</b>  He proclaimed a  proclamation throughout his kingdom. <b> and also in writing</b>  And he also sent his letter throughout his  kingdom about this matter. <b> saying</b>  And so he said to them in his proclamation that he proclaimed and  in his epistle that he sent throughout his kingdom.  <b> 2</b>  <b> So said Cyrus, the king of Persia...delivered to me</b>  that I am the king and ruler over all the  kingdoms. <b> and He commanded me</b>  He commanded me through Isaiah the prophet to build for Him  the Temple in Jerusalem, as it says in the Book of Isaiah (44:28): Who says to Cyrus, He is My  shepherd, and all My desire he shall fulfill, and to say to Jerusalem, It shall be built, and the Temple  shall be founded. (ibid. 45:1): So said the Lord to His anointed one, to Cyrus, whose right hand I  held.... And this prophecy was already stated by lsaiah. <b> in Jerusalem, which is in Judea</b>  whch is in  the province of Judea.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Who is among you</b>  So did he announce and write to all the kingdoms, Who is among you of all His  people, [i.e., of the people] of the Holy One, blessed be He, may the Holy One, blessed be He, be at  his assistance, and let him ascend to build His house that is in Jerusalem.  <b> 4</b>  <b> And whoever remains</b>  and every Jew who remains in his place, who cannot ascend because he has  no money. <b> shall help him</b>  I command the people of his place to provide him and help him with silver,  gold, possessions and cattle, in order that he be able to ascend to Jerusalem with the donation that the  people of his place will donate for the building of the Temple, for also among the nations there were  some who contributed donations to the building of the Temple. <b> Jerusalem</b>  From So said Cyrus until here is the proclamation and the message of the written epistle.  <b> 5</b>  <b> of Judah and Benjamin</b>  the heads of the families of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. <b> inspired</b>  They ascended to Jerusalem to build the Temple with all those whom God inspired to ascend  and to build the Temple.  <b> 6</b>  <b> And all those around them</b>  And all the nations who were Israels neighbors assisted and  strengthened the hands of the Jews with gold and silver and all these gifts in order that they be able to  ascend to Jerusalem. <b> besides all that was donated</b>  All this the neighbors of the Jews did, besides what  they [the Jews] themselves donated for the building of the Temple.  <b> 7</b>  <b> and had placed them in the temple of his god</b>  that Nebuchadnezzar had placed in the temple of his  pagan deity.  <b> 8</b>  <b> by the hand of Mithderath the treasurer</b>  such was the name of Cyruss treasurer, and Cyrus  commanded [him] to take them out. <b> and he counted them out</b>  This treasurer counted them and  delivered them to Sheshbazzar, so that he would carry them and transport them to Jerusalem. Our  Rabbis said: Sheshbazzar is identical with Daniel, and why was he called Sheshbazzar? Because he  endured six troubles  (שש צרות)  . <b> the prince of Judah</b>  He is the prince of the tribe of Judah.  <b> 9</b>  <b> their number</b>  of the vessels of the House of the Lord. <b> basins</b>  Heb.  אגרטלי . They are kinds of  vessels. <b> knives</b>  Heb.  מחלפים . They are knives, and this expression refers to the chamber of the knives  (בית החליפות) . Because they would deposit the knives therein, it was called the chamber of the  depository of the knives  (לשכת בית החליפות) .  <b> 10</b>  <b> bowls</b>  Heb.  כפורי , bowls, and they were called  כפורי  from an expression of wiping, like (Bava  Mezia 24b): who wiped  (דכפר)  his hands on his neighbors cloak, because the one who would  receive the blood in a bowl would wipe the squirtings of the blood that splattered on his hand on the  rim of the bowl. <b> secondary</b>  Heb.  משנים , secondary ones, other vessels of another kind.  <b> 11</b>  <b> All the vessels</b>  Now he totals the sum of those counted and those who were not counted all into  one number, but the important ones he counts. <b> when the exiles were brought up</b>  Heb.  העלות , [a  passive] expression.   <b> Chapter 2</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> And these are the people of the province</b>  These are the Children of Israel who are from the  province of the land of Israel, who are now coming up to Jerusalem from the captivity that is in the  exile. <b> and they returned</b>  And now they returned to Jerusalem. <b> and Judea</b>  And the people of Judea  returned, each one to his city.  <b> 2</b>  <b> [Those] who came</b>  these people of the province, in the beginning, when they went into exile from  Israel to Babylon with Zerubbabel etc. <b> Mispar...the number</b>  Heb.  מספר . [This word appears twice in  this verse.] In the first one, the pay is vowelized with a kamatz, and it is the name of a man; in the  second, the pay is vowelized with a pattah, and it is the construct state, [meaning the number of]. <b> the important men of the people of Israel</b>  These were the great and important people, and the others  followed them. Therefore, they were counted after them separately.  <b> 3</b>  <b> The children of Parosh, etc.</b>  There are some in the chapter for whom the fathers name is used for  the family name [surname] and there are some who are called by the name of their place, i.e., the  children of such-and-such a place.  <b> 36</b>  <b> The priests: the children of Jedaiah</b>  Until here, he counted the children of Judah and Benjamin,  and from now on he counts the priests and the Levites, as he says above (1:5): So the heads of the  families of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites arose....  <b> 41</b>  <b> The singers</b>  The Levites who were singers, and likewise, the gatekeepers are Levites who were  gatekeepers of the gates of the Temple.  <b> 43</b>  <b> The Nethinim</b>  Now he counts those Nethinim who were woodcutters and water-drawers for the  congregation, and from there they derived their livelihood.  <b> 58</b>  <b> and the children of Solomons slaves</b>  King Solomon had slaves, and these children were of their  descendants.  <b> 59</b>  <b> And these were the ones who ascended from Tel-Mela, etc.</b>  And what incident happened to  them? They could not tell.... <b> and their children</b>  [i.e., the children] of their fathers, because they lost  their genealogical records and did not know if they were Israelites.  <b> 60</b>  <b> The children of Delaiah</b>  They too are included in these were the ones who ascended from Tel-  Melah.  <b> 61</b>  <b> who took</b>  Each one of the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite took a wife. <b> name</b>  And the name of Barzillai was called on their name because they took of his daughters.  <b> 62</b>  <b> These</b>  referring to the priests, who had to trace their lineage with that record, and who could not  find the record of their lineage. <b> and they were disqualified</b>  Heb.  ויגאלו , for they were defiled and  purged from the priesthood that they should no longer perform the service with the remaining priests,  because their genealogical record was not found.  <b> 63</b>  <b> Hattirshatha</b>  That is Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah (Neh. 8:9), and our Rabbis said (Yerushalmi  Kid. 4:1) that he was named Hattirshatha because the Sages permitted him  (התר)  to drink  (שתא)  wine of  gentiles because he was the kings butler. <b> of the most holy sacrifices</b>  sin-offerings and guilt-offerings,  like the other priests. <b> until a priest arises, etc.</b>  like a person who says to his friend, Until the Messiah  comes, this matter will not come about. I cannot interpret it to mean: until a priest arises for the Urim  and Tumim in the Second Temple, because we find in Yoma, chapter 1 (21b) that the Urim and Tumim  were missing in the Second Temple.  <b> 64</b>  <b> The entire congregation together</b>  When they were all together with the priests, the Levites and  the Nethinim, they amounted to this number; and the Children of Israel counted above were of the  tribe of Judah and Benjamin, and those missing from this number, which you will not find above, were  of the other tribes. So it is explained in Seder Olam (ch. 29):  The entire congregation together was  forty-two thousand etc. But if you add them up, they are only thirty thousand. Where are the thirteen  thousand? They ascended from the other tribes.  <b> 65</b>  <b> Besides their slaves and their bondwomen</b>  who were not included in the congregation. <b> had two hundred male and female singers</b>  because they were going up joyfully from Babylon to the  land of Israel, they required male and female singers in order that they should stroll among them in  their great joy.  <b> 68</b>  <b> donated</b>  They were donating toward the building of the Temple.  <b> 69</b>  <b> According to their ability</b>  according to their ability and their money. <b> drachmas</b>  Heb.  דרכמונים ,  the name of a golden coin. <b> and priests tunics</b>  in which to serve.   <b> Chapter 3</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> arrived</b>  Heb.  ויגע  like  והגיע , it reached. <b> The seventh month</b>  That is the month of Tishri, and the  Children of Israel who were in the cities, what did they do? They all gathered as one to Jerusalem.  <b> 3</b>  <b> And they set the altar on its bases</b>  in order to offer up sacrifices upon it, because they were afraid  of the peoples of the land, lest they taunt them and lest they slander them to the king. And they built  the altar to offer up burnt offerings upon it, in order that the peoples hear and understand the matter,  that they did it with the sanction of the king and therefore they would hesitate to taunt them about the  building of the Temple. <b> for the morning and for the evening</b>  the daily sacrifice of the morning and  the daily sacrifice of twilight.  <b> 4</b>  <b> and the burnt offering of each day in its day, in the number</b>  the sacrifices of the Festivals in their  number, according to their ordinance.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And afterwards</b>  And after Succoth they would offer up sacrifices every day, for the morning and  for the evening. <b> and for the New Moon</b>  lit. and for the months. And at the beginning of the months  they would offer up the sacrifices of the New Moon. <b> and for all the appointed seasons of the Lord </b> and for the rest of the appointed seasons of their sacrifices. <b> and for everyone who willingly offered </b> And for all those who willingly offered their free-will offerings, the priests would accept them to  sacrifice them, and from the first day of Tishri they commenced to offer up sacrifices, but the  foundation of the Temple was not yet built.  <b> 7</b>  <b> to the Zidonians and to the Tyrians</b>  the people of Tyre and Zidon, who were the artisans who built  the Temple. <b> to the sea of Jaffa</b>  By way of the sea they would bring them. <b> of</b>  Heb.  כרשיון  as the sanction of the king was upon them to build the Temple.  כרשיון  is an expression  of permission  (רשות)  derived from  רשה  ; since from  אבה  to want, he says [i.e., derives]  אביון , a needy  person; and from  צבה , to desire,  צביון , desire; and from  חזה  to see,  חזיון , a vision; and from  רעה ,  רעיון  , thought; from  חבה ,  חביון , hiding; and from  רשה , he says  רשות , permission; like from,  ענה ,  ענות ,  affliction; and from  שבה ,  שבות ,captivity; and from  ראה ,  ראות , a sight; and from  זנה ,  זנות , harlotry. The  result is that  רשות  and  רשיון  are derived from the same root according to the gauge of grammar, and  they are the same expression. Menahem, (p. 34) however, associated it with (Ps. 21:3): and the  speech of his lips  (וארשת) , but he was not exact with its root. Nevertheless, these two manners [of  defining words] are close to each other in their meanings.  <b> 8</b>  <b> in the second month</b>  That is the month of Iyar. <b> from the captivity</b>  all those who came from the  captivity to Jerusalem. <b> and they stationed</b>  They stationed the Levite singers to harmonize and to  recite a song before the builders at the time of the building of the foundation of the Temple. <b> conduct</b>  Heb.  לנצח . These two expressions of  נצוח  are harmonies of song, like (Ps. 4:1): To the  conductor  (למנצח) , a song of David.  <b> 9</b>  <b> And Jeshua...stood</b>  They stood and recited the song together around the ones who did the work of  the foundation of the Temple.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And...laid the foundation</b>   ויסדו  This is the strong conjugation of  יסוד , like (Ezek. 25:4): and  they will settle  (וישבו)  their palaces. Just as  וישבו  is derived from  ישב  so is  ויסדו  derived from  יסד , and their meaning is,  ויסדו   וישבו  in the intensive conjugation with two yuds, one for the  [continuous] action and one for the radical, and their meaning is that they were laying the foundation,  they were settling. <b> And the builders laid the foundation</b>  And the builders were laying the foundation  [see above] of the Temple of the Lord at the time [that] they were harmonizing in their song, and they  stationed the priests attired with elegant garments with trumpets in their hands to sound them. <b> Levites the sons of Asaph</b>  were the singers. <b> with cymbals</b>  Heb.  במצלתים , like (Ps. 150:9): with  loud sounding cymbals  (בצלצלי שמע) . They are musical instruments. <b> through David</b>  for they were  harmonizing and singing songs of David, the king of Israel.  <b> 11</b>  <b> And they sang aloud</b>  Heb.  ויענו , an expression of raising the voice in song, like (Exod. 15:  21): And Miriam raised her voice in song to them. <b> and with thanks</b>  and with thanksgivings. <b> good</b>  to give thanks to the Lord. <b> and the entire people</b>  the rest of the people of Israel. <b> laid</b>  They acted with all these rejoicings because of the building of the foundation, which was laid in  the House of the Lord.  <b> 12</b>  <b> when its foundation was laid</b>  Heb.  ביסדו , with its foundation. With the noun of  יוסד  and from  יסד , he says  ביסדו , like from  חדש ,  בחדשו , and from  קדש ,  בקדשו . <b> this Temple</b>  When they would see the  building of this Temple, they would weep because they remembered the large building of the First  Temple. <b> and many</b>  who had not seen the building of the First Temple, were rejoicing and shouting for  joy with a loud voice, out of their great joy that they had emerged from their exile.  <b> 13</b>  <b> And the people did not recognize</b>  Those listeners did not recognize the voice of the shout of joy,  because of the voice of the peoples weeping, for the rejoicing people were shouting with a great  shout, and the voice of weeping was heard farther and farther away.   <b> Chapter 4</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin</b>  They are the nations whom Sannecherib settled in the land  Israel, as it says (II Kings 17:24): And the king of Assyria brought [people] from Babylonia and from  Cuthah and from Avvah and from Hamath and from Sepharvaim, and he settled them in the cities of  Samaria instead of the Children of Israel.  <b> 2</b>  <b> and said to them, Let us build with you...</b>  They said this in order that through them the work of  the Temple should be disrupted, that they should build no more. <b> king of Assyria</b>  the son of Sannecherib, for after Sannecherib settled them there, as it says (II Kings  29:37, Isa. 37:38): And he was prostrating himself in the temple of Nisroch his god, and Adramelech  and Sharezer, his sons, slew him by the sword etc., and his son Esarhaddon reigned in his stead.  <b> 3</b>  <b> but we</b>  Heb.  כי , but we alone shall build. This  כי  serves in place of  אלא , but.  <b> 4</b>  <b> the people of the land</b>  They are the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin. <b> were hindering</b>  to disrupt  them from their work. <b> from building</b>  Heb.  לבנות , lit. to build, and so (Gen. 41:49): until one ceased  to count  (לספר) .  <b> 5</b>  <b> And they would hire</b>  Heb.  וסכרים . This is written with a sammech, but its meaning is as though it  was written with a sin, [meaning] that they would hire advisors to disrupt the work. <b> all the days of </b> the reign of Cyrus and the reign of Ahasuerus, who reigned after Cyrus, until the second year of  Darius, who reigned after Ahasuerus, the work was stopped.  <b> 6</b>  <b> And in the reign of Ahasuerus</b>  who reigned after Cyrus; he is the Ahasuerus who took Esther. <b> wrote an accusation</b>  not to build the Temple. <b> against the dwellers of Judea and Jerusalem</b>  to  inform on them and to chide them not to build the Temple.  <b> 7</b>  <b> And in the days of Artaxerxes</b>  He is Cyrus, the king of Persia. The numerical value of the letters of  כרש  equal the numerical value of the letters of  דריוש : [ כ  = 20;  ר  = 200;  ש  = 300; total = 520.  ד  = 4;  ר  = 200;  י  = 10; 520  ו  = 6;  ש  = 300; total = 520.] And so we learned in Tractate Rosh Hashanah  (3b): The same one is Cyrus, who is Darius, who is Artaxerxes. [He was called Cyrus  כרש  because  he was a worthy  (כשר)  king; Artaxerxes, because of the kingdom, and in Seder Olam (ch. 30): Darius  was Artaxerxes  (ארתחששתא) , and the entire kingdom was called Artaxerxes, etc. [meaning that all the  kings were called Artaxerxes]. <b> wrote with peace</b>  wrote his letter with words of peace. <b> Tabeel</b>  This is the name of a man, one of the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin. <b> colleagues</b>  Heb.  כנותיו , his companies and his societies. <b> to Artaxerxes</b>  [as translated,] to  Artaxerxes. <b> and the script of the epistle</b>  Heb.  וכתב הנשתון . <b> written in Aramaic</b>  in Aramaic  characters. <b> and explained in Aramaic</b>  The script was explained in the Aramaic language.  <b> 8</b>  <b> Rehum was the secretary</b>  Rehum was the secretary and the master of words to compose the epistle. <b> and Shimshai was the scribe</b>  And Shimshai was the scribe: he is Shimshai the son of Haman. So it is  customary to mention the scribe and the secretary together because they need each other; one  composes and dictates, and the scribe writes, as it says (I Kings 4:3): Eliphoreph and Ahiah, the sons  of Shisha, scribes, Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahlud, the secretary, and in another place it says (Isa. 36:  22): And Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah etc. and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the  secretary, came. <b> they wrote a letter</b>  These two, Rehum and Shimshai, wrote the letter as Mithredath  Tabeel had commanded them, and they all were dwellers of the cities of Samaria. <b> about Jerusalem </b> about the building of the Temple, which is in Jerusalem. <b> as is stated</b>  Aram.  כנמא , as is stated, and that  is similar to the expression of the Gemara: as we wish to say further.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Then</b>  Aram.  אדין , equivalent to the Hebrew  אז . <b> Rehum</b>  the name of a man. <b> the secretary</b>  Aram.  בעל טעם  secretary and master of words. <b> the Dinites, the Apharesattechites, etc.</b>  All these are  names of nations whom Sennacherib repatriated in the cities of Samaria. <b> the Apharesites</b>  They are the  Persians whom Sennacherib settled in the cities of Samaria. <b> the Archevites</b>  They are the people of  Erech, as it says (Gen. 10:10): and Erech and Accad and Calneh. <b> the Babylonians</b>  the people of  Babylon. <b> the Shushanchites</b>  the people of Shushan, the capital. <b> the Elamites</b>  the people of Elam.
