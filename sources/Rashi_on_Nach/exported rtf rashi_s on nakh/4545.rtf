\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the same in the [Second] Temple, for there, we learned (Zeb. 54a): ìThey bring a frame of 32 [cubits] 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ by 32 [cubits], whose height is a cubit,î whereas here its height is two cubits. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and the breadth one

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ being that it [the bottom, 32 by 32 cubit frame] had a recess around it a cubit wide which was the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ base.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cubits and went in one cubit. [In the second Temple, it went up five cubits and went in one.] And this 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is the ìcircuit.î The lower one is called smaller because it is only two [cubits] high, whereas the upper 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ one is four.
