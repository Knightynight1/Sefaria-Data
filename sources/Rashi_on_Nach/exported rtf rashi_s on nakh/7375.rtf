\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ performed charity with it. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ as long as the poor man has not heard a rebuke\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  As long as he does not let 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the poor man hear a rebuke, i.e., he gives to him and does not embarrass him. Another explanation:

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Aggadah interprets it as speaking of the half-shekel, which Scripture levied on all Israel and made the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ poor and the rich equal in that respect—so that the poor does not hear a rebuke from the rich, saying 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to him, “My share is greater than your share in the public sacrifices.”
