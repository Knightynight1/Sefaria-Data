\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which I am not placated, for I have no desire in you. And our Sages expounded in Torath Kohanim (7: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 154): If a person says to his friend, “Close this door for me,” he does not demand compensation for it; 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [or if he says,] “Light this candle for me,” he does not request compensation for it. But you - who is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ there among you who closed My doors, gratis? Neither did you kindle fire on My altar gratis. Surely, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ things that are customarily done for compensation you did not do gratis. Therefore, I have no desire in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ you.
