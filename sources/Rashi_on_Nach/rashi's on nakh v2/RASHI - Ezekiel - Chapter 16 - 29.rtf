\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ but this is its meaning: You added the images of the Chaldeans to those of the Canaanites, who were 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ near you, and you played the harlot with them. However Jonathan rendered: You increased your 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ harlotries with the Chaldeans and You became like the Canaanites, who were steeped in idolatry, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ you increased your gods, joining the people of Canaan who follow the customs of the Chaldeans. But 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to me it appears that \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃ¿«Ú«Ô\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  is like \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÒÂ…Á≈¯\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , a merchant, like (Hosea 12:8): ìA trafficker \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ÎÃ¿«Ú«Ô)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  who has

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ said [concerning Babylon, too,] (17:4): ìand he brought it to the land of merchants \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ÎÃ¿«Ú«Ô)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , in a city of
