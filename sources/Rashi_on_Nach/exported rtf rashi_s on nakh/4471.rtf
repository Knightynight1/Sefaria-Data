\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ bare, but they surrounded it with a balconyî and on that balcony were the chambers, chanbres in Old 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ French. And from that which is stated in this account ìAnd the balcony was to the side of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ gates,î and its base was on line with the height of the gates - we learn that this flooring was a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ balcony.
