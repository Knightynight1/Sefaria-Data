I say that the cells in the north and the south were arranged as 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ follows: each one was twelve cubits long, totaling sixty cubits for five cells, and five walls of five 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cubits each, totaling 85. The width of the cleared space was five cubits. Thus you have accounted for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ninety cubits of the length of the wall, and so to the south. Those in the west were one on top of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ another, and a third atop them, and their length across their top was twenty cubits, paralleling the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ width of the Holy of Holies, making eleven in each row. So did Jonathan render: eleven in a row.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ would rest upon the wall, on its inner side, and puncture it. This is the meaning of ìthe inside of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wall of the cellsî into the side that was toward the interior of the cells; and this is the meaning of ìthat 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ they might hold therein,î - be fastened securely, po[r]pris in Old French, firmly held. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ that they should

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and penetrated the recesses, i.e., the wall of the Heichal protruded into the interior of the cells, as it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ stated regarding Solomonís [Temple] building (I Kings 6:6): ìfor he made rebatements in [the wall of] 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the House round about on the outside.î The width of the interior of the nethermost chamber was five 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cubits, and its upper story was six, for the wall of the Heichal was recessed from above one cubit; 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ therefore the interior of the nethermost one was five cubits wide and the third chamber was seven 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cubits wide and this was atop the middle one, which had the wall of the Heichal protruding into it one 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cubit from above and these too were like them. And this is what is meant by ìand they would nor be 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ held in the wall of the Houseî; they did not penetrate into the wall of the Heichal as do ends of other 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ low beams which are fastened onto a high wall, i.e., [builders usually] make holes in the wall and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ thrust the beams into the holes.
