\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ strong wind, “Do not refrain from blowing strongly to bring My exiles.” Similarly (Song 4: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 16), “Awaken, O north wind, and come, O south wind.” Since the north wind is weak, it needs 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ strengthening. Therefore, it is written, “Awaken,” “Give.” But concerning the south wind which does 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ not need straightening, it is written, “Come,” as it is, and so, “Do not refrain.”
