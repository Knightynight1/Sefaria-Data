\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ edge upon earth (see following verses). From here it was said: The thickness of the firmament is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ equivalent to the space between heaven and earth, since the star is inserted in the firmament like a bolt 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ into a door (this refers to an old fashioned bolt which went through the thickness of the door), i.e., the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ size of its length equaling the thickness of the firmament. Thus from this verse, which attests that from 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ their courses they fought, we derive that the thickness of the firmament is equal to the height between 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ heaven and earth.
