\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ hearts with them, to return, to bring back our hearts before the Omnipresent, blessed be He. (Lam.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Kings 18:44): “There is a cloud as small as a man’s palm, rising.” And similarly, (Job 36:32): “Over the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ clouds \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ëÌÇôÌÇéÄí)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  He covers the rain.” And [according to] the Midrash of our Sages: Let us lift up our 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ hands sincerely to the Holy One, blessed be He, like one who washes his hands with cleanliness, who 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ casts from his hands all contamination, for “he who confesses [his sins] and abandons [them] will 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ obtain mercy, but he who confesses [his sins] but does not abandon [them] is like one who immerses 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ himself while holding a [dead] reptile in his hand.”
