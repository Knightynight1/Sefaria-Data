\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Sabbath.” The watches were renewed on the Sabbath (See \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Taanith\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  2:6,7), viz. the priests and the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Levites; one [watch] would leave and one would come in. Jehoiada detained the watch that was
