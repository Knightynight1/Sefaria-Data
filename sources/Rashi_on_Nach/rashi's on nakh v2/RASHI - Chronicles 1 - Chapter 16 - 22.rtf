\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Gen. 12:17): “And the Lord plagued Pharaoh,” and it is written (ibid. 20:3): “And the Lord came to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Abimelech in a dream at night and said to him: You shall die, etc.” Concerning Jacob it says: (ibid. 31: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 24): “And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night, and said to him: Beware, etc.” And 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ further, concerning Jacob, when they came to kill him because they killed Shechem and Hamor, it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ writ ten: (ibid. 35:5): “Then they journeyed on, and the terror of God was, etc.” The Book of Psalms is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ more explicit, for the psalm does not terminate here, as it is written there (105:16): “He called a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ famine upon the land,” in order to exile them to Egypt.
