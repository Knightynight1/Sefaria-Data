\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ north to south was fifty cubits, as is stated below in this section, and the interior of the Outer Court 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ was [a total of] one hundred cubits wide, as is stated above (40:23): “and he measured, from gate to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ gate, one hundred cubits.” We thus find that before the chambers was an empty space one hundred 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cubits long and fifty cubits wide.
