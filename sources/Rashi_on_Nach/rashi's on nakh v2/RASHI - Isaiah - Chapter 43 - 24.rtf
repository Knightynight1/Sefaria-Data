You did not have to purchase it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ with money, for it was very common in your land. Said Rabbi Abba: Cinnamon grew in the Land of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Israel, and goats and deer would eat of it. In Midrash Eichah (Proem X). ([Some manuscripts read:]

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ you should have, and you were attracted to idolatry.) \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ But you have burdened Me\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  [lit. you have 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ overworked Me.] You have caused Me to be an attendant to pagans, as Ezekiel envisioned (1:4): “And 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ behold a tempest was coming from the north.” For the chariot of the Shechinah was returning from 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Babylon, where it had gone to conquer the whole world under the domination of Nebuchadnezzar, lest 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ they say that He delivered His children into the hands of an inferior nation, as is found in Hagigah 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (13b).
