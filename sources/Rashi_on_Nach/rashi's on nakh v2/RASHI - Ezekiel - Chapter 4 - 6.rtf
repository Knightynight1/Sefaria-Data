\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from the time that the ten tribes were exiled until Jerusalem was destroyed, forty years: 22 of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Manasseh, about whom it is written (II Kings 21:3): “as Ahab...had made,” and Ahab had reigned 22 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ years; two of Ammon and 11 of Jehoiakim, and this prophecy was transmitted to Ezekiel in the fifth 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ year of Zedekiah. This totals 40 years. The grand total is four hundred and thirty [years]. After this 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ prophecy, they remained yet six years, equaling 8 jubilees and 36 years. In 8 jubilees [there] are 8 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cycles of Sabbatical years, equaling 56 Sabbatical years, totaling 64 [hallowed years]. In 36 years, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ there are 5 Sabbatical years, totaling 69 land-release years, and the final jubilee year is accounted to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ them as an iniquity because they were exiled from it [the land] because of their iniquity, totaling 70 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ hallowed years of land release, which Israel did not observe. Therefore, they were exiled 70 years to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ fulfill (Lev. 26:34): “Then the land will appease its Sabbaths.” That is what is written at the end of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Chronicles (II 36:21): “To fulfill the word of the Lord [that was] in the mouth of Jeremiah, until the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ land has appeased its Sabbaths, for as long as it lay desolate, it rested, to complete seventy 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ years.” “Your left side” symbolizes Samaria; “your right side” symbolizes Judah, because Judah is in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the south of the land of Israel, as it is said (16:46): “And your big sister Samaria...who lives at your 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ left.” Also in the Book of Joshua (15:1), he describes the border of the tribe of Judah as occupying 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the entire southern border.
