\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ had many children has been bereaved and buries her children. Hannah bore seven, as it is stated: For 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the Lord remembered Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters (2:21). 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ When Hannah bore four, Peninnah buried eight, and when she conceived and bore a fifth child, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Peninnah prostrated herself at her feet, and begged for mercy. Consequently, they lived, and were 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ therefore called on her name. This is Rabbi Nehemiah’s opinion. Rabbi Judah says: Grandchildren are 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ considered like children, (and she saw Samuel’s two sons). Some say: the numerical value of \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ùáòä
