\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ O.F., and in the language of the Talmud, we find, ìhe bumped \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Ë«¯¿È≈‰)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  his headî (Chullin 45b). 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Menahem explained it as an expression of moisture, i.e., moist and wet, always oozing [muyte in O.F.]. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ they have not been sprinkled\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  These lesions were not sprinkled with medicinal powders by physicians. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ This is an expression of: (Job 18:15) ìSulphur shall be sprinkled \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (È¿Ê…¯∆‰)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  on his dwelling.î Menahem 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ explained it as an expression of healing, as in (Jeremiah 30:13): ìNo one pronounced your judgment 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for healing \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Ï¿Ó»ÊÂ…¯)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ .î \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ neither was it softened with oil\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Their wound was not softened with oil, as is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ customary with other wounds. It would be inappropriate to say here, ìThey were not softened with 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ oil,î for they soften only the place of the sore, not the wound and the contusion but the sprinkling and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the bandaging applies to all three, [i.e., the wound, the contusion, and the lacerated sore.] Therefore, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the plural number applies to them; the lesions were not sprinkled and not bandaged. Jonathan 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ interprets the entire verse figuratively, referring to the fact that they were soiled and afflicted with 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ iniquity. Accordingly, he rendered, ìFrom the sole of the foot until the head,î from the smallest to the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ greatest, there is no soundness. There is none good among them, wounds and contusions, rebellious 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ deeds, iniquities, and inadvertent sins. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ they have not been sprinkled...\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  i.e., they have not been healed 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ by repenting wholeheartedly, nor has it been softened with oil, not even a trace of repentant thought 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ has entered their heart.
