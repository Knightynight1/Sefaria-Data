\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ He turns it, they will fall, like one who holds something in his hand, and when he inclines his hand, it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ falls. So is the Midrash Aggadah (Mechilta, Exodus 15:12). Jonathan, however, renders: shall raise the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ blow of His might.
