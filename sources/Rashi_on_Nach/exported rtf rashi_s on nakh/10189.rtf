\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ meaning is: when he went to establish his power, to restore his boundary and to establish it by the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Euphrates River, for he was restoring to the boundary (sic) of the Euphrates River. An example is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Sam. II 18:18): ìAnd Absalom took and established for himself in his lifetime, etc., and he called it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Yad Absalom,î meaning the power of the boundary of Absalom. Another explanation of, ìand he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ called it Yad Absalomî: Absalom engraved the form of the length of his hand in the middle of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ monument, as it is written in that verse, that he said that this engraving was engraved after the shape 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of Absalomís hand. (I heard this from Isaac the son of Rabbi Samuel in Narbonne.)
