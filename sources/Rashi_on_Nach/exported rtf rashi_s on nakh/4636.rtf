\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ falls into the Great Sea in the southwestern corner. Moses, too, delineated the southern boundary in

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ other instance in which the accent is on the first syllable, I would have said that it is an error, and that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Jonathan did not translate it that way, only erring readers.
