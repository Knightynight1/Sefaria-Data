\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ him so much strength to amass such a fortune for the building of the Temple, as it is written (above 17: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 12): ìHe will build Me a House,î and near this [is written]: ìO Lord, for the sake of Your servant and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ according to Your own heart, You have brought about all this greatness.î Now the expression of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ greatness can also refer to the building of the Temple, as it is written (above 22:5): ì... and the House 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to build for the Lord, to magnify it on high.î \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ Yours, O Lord, are the greatness\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Although I have 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ amassed all this fortune for the building of the Temple, which is called greatness, You have given me 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ all this greatness. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ the might\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  for You gave me might to wage war with Israelís enemies and to plunder 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ their spoils before You, to build the House, as above. After he had waged war with all his enemies and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ defeated them, it is written (above 18:11): ìThose also King David dedicated to the Lord, etc.î \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ the

This is intoned with an \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ‡∆˙¿«Á¿˙Ã»‡\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ hiatus, for the verse ends here, and it refers to that which is above it, as I have explained. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ Yours is the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ kingdom and [You are He] Who is exalted over everything as the Leader\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  The meaning is: If a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ flesh and blood king gives a position or a ruling power in the kingdom to one of his servants after the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ prince, he is his servant wherever he is, but the kingdom does not belong to the king, and the one to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ whom the kingdom belongs does not have the servant, but as for the Holy One, blessed be He - the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ servant appointed to rule is His, and also the kingdom is His (\lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ cotre\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  in Old French, kingdom) and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ therefore, it is written: ìYours is the kingdom, and You are He Who is exalted î over them, for even 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the superintendent of the well is appointed from heaven (\lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Baba Bathra\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  91b). They explained further: ì... 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and [You are He] Who is exalted over everything at the beginning.î When we think that we have 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ praised You with all the thanksgivings, and You have no more praise, it is still nothing, for the praised 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ One stands at the beginning of the praises. And so when David concludes all his praises in Psalms, he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ commences with the final psalm (149:1): ìSing to the Lord a new song,î i.e., all the praises are new, as 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ though we had never praised Him. In this manner Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Meir the son of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Rabbi Isaac of Orleans explained, and it seems to me that it is so in Hagigah Yerushalmi.
