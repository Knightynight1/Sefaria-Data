<b> Ezekiel</b>  <b> Chapter 1</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year</b>  The prophet presented his words obscurely and did not  tell his name, who he was; nor did he explain from what date he was counting. Therefore, the holy  spirit interrupted his words in the following two verses to teach [us] who the prophet was and to teach  [us] from what date he was counting. As it is said: On the fifth day of the monththat is the fifth year,  etc. These are not the words of the prophet, for he already stated that he was standing on the fifth of  the month, and furthermore, from the beginning he had stated his prophecy in the first person: and I  was in the midst of the exile; and I saw visions of God. And so at the end: And I saw, and behold,  a storm wind, etc. Now these [next] two verses interrupted his words, as though someone else was  speaking about him: The word of the Lord was [revealed] to Ezekiel...and the hand of the Lord came  upon him there. <b> as I was in the midst of the exile</b>  i.e., outside the land of Israel. <b> Chebar</b>  The name of the river. <b> visions of God</b>  Heb.  מראות . Because he did not see with a lucid  speculum, he calls it visions of God, a sort of dream, insubstantial. All the prophets also saw  through a dim speculum, except for our teacher Moses. That is what is said (Hos. 12:11): and to the  prophets, I assumed likenesses.  <b> 2</b>  <b> that is the fifth year of King Jehoiachins exile</b>  Thus, we may deduce that the thirty years he  counted, he counted from the beginning of the jubilee [cycle]: the last jubilee commenced at the  beginning of the eighteenth year of Josiah[s reign]; that is, the year that Hilkiah found the scroll (II  Kings 22). So we learn in Seder Olam (ch. 26), that the beginning of the jubilee was that [year]. Josiah  reigned thirty one years. Subtracting from them the seventeen years that had already passed leaves  fourteen years. Jehoiakim reigned eleven years; [together, that] totals twenty-five years. Jeconiah  [Jehoiachin] his son, had reigned only three months when he was exiled, and the year that Ezekiel  prophesied was the fifth [year] of his exile, hence the thirtieth year of the jubilee. And so we find that  at the end of his prophecy, he gives a sign using the count of the jubilee [as a reference], for it says  (40:1): In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the  month. Our Rabbis said (Arachin 12a): What year is it that begins on the tenth of the month? You  must say that this is the jubilee year [See Leviticus 25:9f.].  <b> 3</b>  <b> The word of the Lord was [revealed]</b>  Heb.  היה היה  [lit. being was.] Our Sages said (Mechilta to  Exod. 12:1): [It] had already come, because the Shechinah does not rest upon a prophet outside the  [Holy] Land, except by having first rested upon him in the Land. We learned in a Baraitha of the  Mechilta (Exod. 15:9): [The verse 2:1,] Son of man, stand on your feet, was the [actual] beginning  of the Book, only there is no chronological order [in Scripture]. Others say that (12:1f.) Son of man,  compose a riddle, is the [true] beginning of the Book. [Mechilta ends here.] I say that this prophecy  was told to him before they were exiled, because it is appropriate to be said to him in the Land, for the  community of the exile is not mentioned explicitly in it. It can be recognized as the beginning of his  mission to them. Jonathan, too, paraphrased in that manner: The prophetic word from before the Lord  was revealed to Ezekiel the son of Buzi the priest in the land of Israel; it returned a second time and  spoke with him in the state of the land of the Chaldeans. Now Ezekiel was exiled with the craftsmen  and the sentries of the gates, who were exiled with Jehoiachin. <b> the hand of the Lord</b>  Every  expression of  יד  mentioned in this Book or in any expression of prophecy is invariably an expression  of compulsion, [implying] that the prophecy seizes him against his will, like a person going mad,  destreze in Old French, compulsion.  <b> 4</b>  <b> and behold, a tempest was coming from the north</b>  That is the Chariot of the throne of the glory of  the Shechinah, as it is described in this chapter (verse 28). Since it came with fury to destroy Israel, it  is therefore likened to a tempest and a [storm] cloud. <b> coming from the north</b>  It was returning from  the land of the Chaldeans, which is in the north. As it is said (Jer. 1:14): From the north the  misfortune will break forth. And why did it go there [first]? In order to subjugate the whole world to  Nebuchadnezzar, to prevent the nations from saying that He delivered His children into the hands of a  lowly nation, for the Chaldeans were [considered] a lowly nation. As it is said (Isa. 23:13): this  people has never been. So did our Sages expound on this verse in tractate Chagigah (13b). <b> brightness around it</b>  Surrounding the cloud on the outside, implying that Israel was destined to be  redeemed from there [Babylonia]. <b> it was like the color of the chashmal</b>  Chashmal is an angel  bearing that name, and he [Ezekiel] saw [something] like the appearance of its color in the midst of the  fire. And so did our Sages say: There was an incident involving a child who was expounding on the  account of the Chariot. He perceived the meaning of chashmal, [whereupon] fire emanated from the  chashmal and consumed him. They said further that the word itself is a combination: When they  asked, What is chashmal? replied Rav Judah, Living beings  (חיות)  of fire  (אש)  that speak  (ממללות)  . In a Baraitha we learned: Sometimes silent  (חשות) , sometimes speaking  (ממללות)  when the speech  emanates from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, they remain silent. When the speech does  not emanate from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, they speak; that is, they laud and praise  the Lord (Chag. 13). [Possibly, chashmal is the name of the color resembling the color of fire, for he  said, Chashmal from the midst of the fire, and he said (verse 27): the color of chashmal, the  appearance of fire within it found about, from the appearance of his loins and above. And, he says in  the second vision (8:2): and from his loins and above was like the appearance of a splendor, like the  color of chashmal. An addendum that I heard.] And from the midst of it, [i.e.,] that fire, I saw  something like the color of chashmal that appeared from the midst of the fire. But we do not know  what it is, and the midrash that our Sages expounded on it, [defining chashmal as] living beings of  fire that speak, does not seem to me to the context.  <b> 5</b>  <b> they had the likeness of a man</b>  This is surprising, because they had also the likeness of an ox, a  lion, and an eagle! Apparently, since this [being] is the patron of them all [all the living beings], the  prophet praises the Chariot with it. [Their human face] had the countenance of our father Jacob.  <b> 6</b>  <b> and each one had four faces</b>  Each one means that the human countenance had four faces, as did  that of the lion, the eagle, and the ox, totaling sixteen [faces] to one living being. It was thus for each  living being, and four wings for each of the faces, totaling sixty-four wings for each living being. This  is [why] Jonathan paraphrased: two hundred fifty-six wings.  <b> 7</b>  <b> were straight legs</b>  [Jonathan renders]:  רגלין כיונן  parallel legs, this one opposite this one. Another  explanation: straight, meaning they had no knee joints by which to bend their legs because they do  no sitting or lying. Therefore they do not require joints like those of animalsthe upper joint and the  lower joint by which it bends its legs to lie down. <b> a round foot</b>  Heb.  עגל , a round foot, and so did  Jonathan render it: round feet. <b> and they sparkled</b>  Because of their brilliance, sparks seemed to  emanate from them, as we say in tractate Yoma (37b): She too [Queen Helene] made a golden  candelabrum, etc. When the sun shone, sparks would [seemingly] emanate from it, etc.  ונוצצים  is  etincelants in French, gleaming. <b> like the color</b>  Heb.  כעין , like  מראה , the appearance. <b> copper</b>  Heb.  קלל , clarified and gleaming. Menachem (Machbereth p. 155) associated it with (Lev. 2:  14): roasted  (קלוי)  in fire.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And human hands were beneath their wings</b>  As the Targum paraphrases: to pick up coals of fire  with them, etc. Likewise, we find in this Book (10:7): And the cherub stretched forth his hand, etc. to  the fire that was between the cherubim, and he picked it up and gave it to the hands of the one dressed  in linen. And so, [in the verse] after it, And there appeared to the cherubim the form of a human  hand, etc. The human hands pick up the fire and give it to the cherub, and the cherub [gives it] to the  messenger, in order [to allow] the coals to cool off [as they pass] from hand to hand, to mitigate  Israels punishment. <b> on their four sides</b>  To the four directions of the world, for they have faces and  wings in every direction. <b> and their faces and their wings were the same to all four of them</b>  As the  Targum renders: were the same to all four of them.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Their wings joined one to the other</b>  Each ones wing was spread out to the side of the other ones  wing this way [lit. to here] and that way [lit. to here] until they join and touch each other, thereby  covering their faces, for the wings are spread out over the face. <b> they did not turn when they walked </b> If they wished to walk in any desired direction, they did not need to turn their faces because they have  faces on every side; therefore each one went in the direction of his facein the direction of the face on  that side where they desired to go, they would go.  <b> 11</b>  <b> And so were their faces, and their wings were extended upward</b>  Had I not seen the cantillation  sign of a zakef gadol [indicating a pause] punctuating And so were their faces, I would not know  how to explain it, but the punctuation taught me to separate them [the words of the verse] one from  the other and to place the word  ופניהם  by itself. And so, [this] is its explanation: And they had faces  and their wings were extended above their faces and covered them. How so? Each had two wings  joined to each otherto each face, their two wings were joined. On each one, the wing of this living  being was stretched out towards the side of that living being, and this ones towards the side of this  one, and the face that was in between was covered by them. [A verse whose wording] is similar to the  language of this verse appears again in this chapter (verse 18): And they had backs, and they were  very high and they were dreadful. The word  וגביהן , and they had backs, stands by itself. <b> covering their bodies</b>  And the two remaining wings would cover their bodies.  <b> 12</b>  <b> wherever would be the will</b>  Heb.  רוח , usually spirit, here means will: the will to go.  <b> 13</b>  <b> it was going among the living beings</b>  That appearance  (מראה)  was going among all the living  beings. <b> there was a brightness to the fire</b>  More than [there is to] our fire. <b> lightning</b>  Heb.  ברק ,  flandours in Old French, lightning flashes.  <b> 14</b>  <b> would run and return, like the appearance of the sparks</b>  Our Sages explained (Chag. 13b): They  would run and return like the flame of a furnace, which constantly shoots out of the mouth of the  furnace and hastens back to enter. So, when they would thrust their heads out from under the expanse  that was extended above themas is delineated in the chapterthey would recoil because of the  Shechinah, which is above the expanse, and they hasten to pull their heads [down]. <b> appearance of the sparks</b>  Heb.  הבזק , de letincelle in French, and the color of their fire is like the  color of the fire that emanates from between the shards within which gold is refined in a furnace. The  fire that emanates from there is colored with these colors (ibid.). [AddendumOthers explain  הבזק  as  an expression of scattering, as our Sages explained it (Gen. Rabbah 50:1): like the appearance of the  bazak R. Judah in the name of R. Simon in the name of R. Levi the son of Perata: Like one who  scatters  (הבוזק)  gefeth in a stove, i.e., he scatters gefeth the residue of olives in a stove: it ignites  quickly and raises a flame, and the flame ascends and descends, and this is the meaning of would run  and return. Furthermore we find in their words (Sanh. 108b, according to Aruch)  בזק  used as an  expression of scattering: He scattered  (בזק)  dust on them and it turned into swords, meaning he  scattered, and so in the Mishnah (Eruvin 10:14): We may scatter  (בוזקין)  salt on the ramp so that  they should not slip.  בזק  may also be defined as  ברק  (lightning), which is an expression of searching.  End of addendum, not found in (sic) all editions.]  <b> 15</b>  <b> one wheel [was] on the ground</b>  On the floor of the expanse. <b> for its four faces</b>  of each living  being, or the wheel had four faces. Our Rabbis said (Chag. 13b): This is Sandalphon [the angel], who  stands on the ground yet whose head reaches up among the living beings. From the context we learn  that the wheels were four.  <b> 16</b>  <b> like the appearance of crystal</b>  Heb.  תרשיש , like a precious stone named tarshish, cristal in  French. <b> as...would be</b>  A wheel set within a wheel, crosswise. Since they go to every side, with their  faces to the four directions, the wheel must roll in its four directions.  <b> 17</b>  <b> toward their four sides, etc.</b>  Because of the working of the wheels, he had to repeat them [i.e., the  description of the living beings movements], to say that the wheels did not stop them because they  [the living beings] too were made for that [i.e., moving in four directions].  <b> 18</b>  <b> And they had backs</b>  Heb.  וגביהן , lit. and their backs. And they had backs. <b> high, and they were dreadful</b>  They were frightful to look upon. Others interpret: they had  fear, meaning they stood in awe. <b> and their eyebrows</b>  Heb.  וגבתם , et leurs sourcils in French. <b> full of eyes round about</b>  to see in all directions, for they did not turn when they went.  <b> 19</b>  <b> off the ground</b>  Off the floor of the expanse, and so did Jonathan render: off the high heavens;  meaning when they lifted themselves up from the depths to the heights.  <b> 20</b>  <b> the will</b>  The will of the Holy One, blessed be He. <b> there was the will to go</b>  It was not necessary to  tell them [to go] to this side [or that] because the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, was in the living  beings, and the will of the living beings was in the wheels.  <b> 21</b>  <b> When they would go</b>  Heb.  בלכתם , [i.e.,] the living beings. <b> they would go</b>  Heb.  ילכו  [i.e.,] the  wheels.  <b> 22</b>  <b> the severe frost</b>  Jonathan rendered:  גליד חסין , severe frost, gelee forte in French.  <b> 23</b>  <b> straight</b>  Parallel.  <b> 24</b>  <b> like the sound of many waters</b>  I would think that the voice was low. Therefore, Scripture adds:  like the sound of the Almighty, like the voice delineated in the Holy Writings (Ps. 29:4f.): The voice  of the Lord is in strength, etc. The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars. <b> the sound of a camp</b>  Like the sound of their speech when they thank and bless their Master; it was  like the sound of the camp of the angels on high. <b> wings</b>  [and cease] from making a sound be heard, and Jonathan rendered: when they would stand,  they would silence their wings because of the speech, [i.e., because of] the speech of the Omnipresent  emanating from above their heads, to let the prophets hear His mission, as he [Ezekiel] concludes  (verse 25): And there was a voice, etc. The Midrash Aggadah (Gen. Rabbah 65:11) states: When  they would stop praising [God] so that Israel would praise first.  <b> 25</b>  <b> And there was a voice above the expanse</b>  Jonathan rendered: And at the time that there was a  will before Him to make His speech heard to His servantsthe prophets of Israelthere was a voice, and  it was heard from above the expanse, from between the cherubim, from beneath the expanse that was  over their heads. <b> they would let down their wings</b>  out of the fear of the speech.  <b> 27</b>  <b> And I saw like the color of chashmal</b>  No permission was granted to ponder over this verse. <b> within it</b>  Within it was like the appearance of fire.  <b> 28</b>  <b> and I fell on my face</b>  I prostrated myself. <b> and I heard a voice speaking</b>  And what did it say?   <b> Chapter 2</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> And He said to me: Son of man, etc.</b>  He calls Ezekiel son of man because he saw the Celestial  Chariot while walking among [the denizens ofMalbim ed.] the heavenly heights and involving himself  with it like the angels, as if to say There is no one here of woman born but this one. (So did a man  explain this to my rabbi, and he [thus] pleased him. I hold, however, that He called him son of  man only so that he should not become haughty from having become familiar with the Celestial  Chariot and with workings of the heavenly beings.This [latter remark] does not appear in other  editions.  <b> 2</b>  <b> what was being spoken to me</b>  Heb.  מדבר . What was being spoken with me. And it is respectful to  write  מדבר  when referring to [the One in] Heaven, for if one says  מדבר , the implication is [that He  speaks] like a man who speaks to his fellow, turning to him face to face; but if one says  מדבר , it means  that the Shechinah, in His eminence, is soliloquizing, and His messengers will overhear; porpariliz in  Old French, intimate words.  <b> 3</b>  <b> to rebellious nations</b>  Two tribes are called two nations.  <b> 4</b>  <b> And the sons</b>  Since He says, their fathers rebelled against Me, and these sons of theirs are brazen-  faced.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And they whether they listen or whether they forbear</b>  from listening. <b> house</b>  They are remonstrative people, but I want them to know at the time of their retribution that a  prophet had been in their midst who reproved them, and they did not heed.  <b> 6</b>  <b> obstinate</b>  Heb.  סרבים , a term for disobedience, like  סרבנים  (Menachem p.129), but Dunash (p. 77)  interpreted it as a word for thorns [like the next word,  סלונים . Consequently] there are two words  [for thorns]. <b> and thorny</b>  Heb.  וסלונים , a word for thorns, and so (below 28:24) a pricking briar  (סלון)  and a piercing thorn. <b> and you sit on eglantines</b>  Heb.  עקרבים . The people whom you reprove  will weary you and provoke you [making you feel] as if you were sitting on eglantines, which prick  you on all sides.  עקרבים  are eglantiers in French, eglantines. Another interpretation: literally  scorpions [the usual meaning of  עקרבים ] and so did Jonathan render: and among people whose  deeds are like scorpions, you dwell.  <b> 8</b>  <b> do not be rebellious</b>  [to refrain] from going on My mission. <b> open</b>  Heb.  פצה , open, and so (Lam. 3:  46): they have opened  (פצו)  their mouth against us. <b> open your mouth and eat</b>  This is figurative.  Bend your ear and hearken, and it will please you as if you are hungrily eating food. <b> what I give you </b> What is the giving? It is the scroll of the book.  <b> 9</b>  <b> and behold, etc.</b>  Some things adopt both masculine and feminine gender, such as (Gen. 19:23): The  sun had risen  (יצא)  [msc.] over the earth, etc.; (Mal. 3:20), And for you who fear My name, shall  the sun of mercy rise  (וזרחה)  [fem.]), etc. [Likewise] (Gen. 32:9), If Esau comes to the one camp  (האחת)  [fem.] and strikes it  (והכהו)  [msc.].  <b> 10</b>  <b> before and behind</b>  That which existed from the beginning and that which is destined to be in the  end. <b> lamentations</b>  The retribution of the righteous in this world. <b> and murmuring</b>  Heb.  והגה .

[i.e.,] this is a  transposed verse.  <b> 9</b>  <b> As shamir</b>  It is a kind of worm, to which they show a stone, and it [the stone] splits in front of it.  [Gloss: Another explanation: Shumir is a term for a strong rock, and in Targum Yerushalmi it is used as  the translation of  צור , rock, and so too is the Targum of  מצור החלמיש  as  משמיר טנרא  out of the  flinty rock (Deut. 8:15). Shamir also means the strongest iron. For just as the strongest rock is called  shamir, so is the [element] iron called shamir because of its strength.

Jonathan rendered:  אפרורון , which are villages that his armies make, and [the armies] dwell in  tents on [all] sides of the city, so that no man could come or go. Another explanation is that  כרים  are  officers appointed over the army; this one guards on this side, and that one on that side.  <b> 3</b>  <b> an iron wall</b>  A semblance of the city wall that serves as a partition between the army and the city. <b> that is a sign</b>  that so will Jerusalem come under siege.  <b> 4</b>  <b> on your left side</b>  to bear the pain and torture [over] the number of days corresponding to the  number of years that My spirit oppressed Me, so to speak, because they provoked Me, and you will  atone for their iniquity since the retribution that I say I will bring upon them is painful to you.  <b> 5</b>  <b> I have given you the years of their iniquity, etc.</b>  I have made it easier for you to tolerate the pain  that I Myself suffered for the number of the years that they sinned before Me: for you I converted it to  that number in days. [Another explanation:  שני  is like  שנים , two, and so did Jonathan render: Now I  have given you twice as much as their iniquity. This does not appear in other editions]. <b> and ninety days</b>  We learned in Seder Olam (ch. 26): This teaches us that Israel sinned for three  hundred and ninety years from the time they entered the Land until the ten tribes were exiled  therefrom. You find [the events of] two hundred and forty-three of them delineated: From the time  Jeroboam assumed the throne until Hoshea son of Elah was exiled and in the days that the judges  judged are one hundred and eleven years. The rest, however, are not delineated. (These are [the  calculations of] the three hundred and ninety yearsthat I found in a responsum from Rabbi Joseph, the  head of the yeshivahthat the ten tribes sinned from the days of Joshua until Sannecherib exiled them  from Samaria. Calculate: in the days of the Judges there were 8 years under the rule of Cushan, 18  under the rule of Eglon, 20 under the rule of Sisera, 7 under the rule of Midian, 18 under the rule of  the children of Ammon, and 40 under the rule of the Philistines. This totals 111. From Micah until the  Ark was captured were 40 years, totaling 151. Calculate for Jeroboam son of Nebat 22, Nadab his son  2, Baasa 24, Elah his son 2, Omri 12, Ahab 22, Ahaziah his son 2, Jehoram his brother 12, Jehu 28,  Jehoahaz 17, Jehoash his son 16, Jeroboam his son 41the total is 350 (sic.). And [with] Menachem son  of Gadi 10, Pekahiah his son 2, Pekah son of Remaliah 20, and Hoshea son of Elah 9 years, the total is  391, but Hosheas last year is not counted because in Hosheas ninth year, Samaria was captured and  Hoshea was counted as having reigned 8 years, leaving a total of 390. The forty years that the kings of  Judah sinned after the exile of Sannecherib until [the prophecy of] this chapter was said to Ezekiel are  delineated below, and I did not find it necessary to explain them. This is not found in other editions.)  <b> 6</b>  <b> the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days</b>  This teaches us that the house of Judah sinned,  from the time that the ten tribes were exiled until Jerusalem was destroyed, forty years: 22 of  Manasseh, about whom it is written (II Kings 21:3): as Ahab...had made, and Ahab had reigned 22  years; two of Ammon and 11 of Jehoiakim, and this prophecy was transmitted to Ezekiel in the fifth  year of Zedekiah. This totals 40 years. The grand total is four hundred and thirty [years]. After this  prophecy, they remained yet six years, equaling 8 jubilees and 36 years. In 8 jubilees [there] are 8  cycles of Sabbatical years, equaling 56 Sabbatical years, totaling 64 [hallowed years]. In 36 years,  there are 5 Sabbatical years, totaling 69 land-release years, and the final jubilee year is accounted to  them as an iniquity because they were exiled from it [the land] because of their iniquity, totaling 70  hallowed years of land release, which Israel did not observe. Therefore, they were exiled 70 years to  fulfill (Lev. 26:34): Then the land will appease its Sabbaths. That is what is written at the end of  Chronicles (II 36:21): To fulfill the word of the Lord [that was] in the mouth of Jeremiah, until the  land has appeased its Sabbaths, for as long as it lay desolate, it rested, to complete seventy  years. Your left side symbolizes Samaria; your right side symbolizes Judah, because Judah is in  the south of the land of Israel, as it is said (16:46): And your big sister Samaria...who lives at your  left. Also in the Book of Joshua (15:1), he describes the border of the tribe of Judah as occupying  the entire southern border.  <b> 7</b>  <b> And to the siege of Jerusalem</b>  which is engraved on the brick, you shall direct your face; when you  lie on your left side, the brick should be opposite you, and so too when you lie on your right. <b> arm</b>  shall be bared toward them (Other editions read: opposite it), like a fighting man. This symbolizes  Nebuchadnezzar, who will fight against it. <b> bared</b>  Heb.  חשופה , like  גלויה .  <b> 8</b>  <b> I have placed ropes upon you</b>  The decree of My commandments shall be stringent upon you as you  were bound with ropes so that you should not turn from side to side. <b> your siege</b>  The number of these days that I decreed upon you.  <b> 9</b>  <b> wheat and barley, etc., and millet and spelt</b>  paniz et epeltre in Old French, millet and spelt. A sign  of the famine that will be upon them in the days of the siege, and they will eat a bread of mixed  [grains] while nauseated.  <b> 10</b>  <b> with a weight</b>  [This is] symbolic of the besieged people, who are fearful of the famine and [so] eat  with a measure and drink with a measure.  <b> 11</b>  <b> from time to time</b>  From day to day you shall drink with this measure, viz. a sixth of a hin.  <b> 12</b>  <b> And as barley cakes you shall eat it</b>  Rolled out in a repulsive manner like the rolling of barley,  not nicely like the rolling out of a wheat cake. <b> and they shall bake it with human excrement</b>  They  shall bake it with their coals that dry it out and burn it.  <b> 13</b>  <b> unclean</b>  An expression of repugnance.  <b> 14</b>  <b> 0</b>  An expression of sighing. <b> my soul has not been defiled</b>  I did not entertain erotic thoughts by  day, bringing myself to nocturnal pollution. <b> and was torn</b>  The flesh of a dying animal, which resembles an animal that died by itself and an animal  that was torn by beasts. <b> loathsome meat</b>  An animal [of debatable status] upon which a rabbi ruled  [permissively]. This cannot mean an animal that actually died by itself or that was torn [by beasts,  injuring it so that it could not live for a year], because if so, what was the greatness of Ezekiel?  <b> 15</b>  <b> dung</b>  Heb.  צפיעי  [synonymous with]  גללי , excrement.  <b> 16</b>  <b> the staff of bread</b>  the support of bread, pozon de pan in Old French. <b> and with worry</b>  They will  worry that their bread supply will be depleted.  דאגה  means aynse in Old French, anxiety, and in our  language [dialect] doubt, terror, fright.  <b> 17</b>  <b> Because they will lack</b>  Their worry and their bewilderment will be because they will lack bread  and water in the days of the siege, and they will worry that the supply will be entirely depleted.   <b> Chapter 5</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> a sharp sword</b>  symbolizing the sword of Nebuchadnezzar. <b> a cobblers razor</b>  Heb.  הגלבים , the  cobblers. It is Greek, and some say that it is parcheminer in Old French, cobbler, saddler. However,  Menachem (p. 56) defines  תער הגלבים  as, the barbers razor. No similar word exists in Scripture.  <b> 2</b>  <b> in the midst of the city</b>  that you inscribed on the brick, as the completion of the days of the siege.  This is a sign that a third of them will perish in the heat of hunger in its midst, which is like fire, in the  same way that it says (Lam. 5:10): Our skin is parched as by a furnace because of the heat of  hunger. <b> and strike</b>  it. <b> with a sword all around it</b>  Around that brick, symbolizing those who flee  from the city, whom the Chaldeans will overtake and slay in the environs of Jerusalem. <b> you shall scatter to the wind</b>  symbolizing the exiles who will go to Egypt, viz. Johanan son of  Kareach and his associates, and there I shall unsheathe a sword [in pursuit] after them, for  Nebuchadnezzar went and destroyed Egypt, and there they were slain.  <b> 3</b>  <b> and you shall bind them in your skirts</b>  These are the few people who will be exiled to Babylon and  will live. An addendum to Rashi reads: <b> and you shall bind them</b>  From here is an allusion [to the fact]  that whoever cuts his hair should not cast it away, but should hide it, for any act written in these verses  has implications of evil.  <b> 4</b>  <b> And you shall take more of them</b>  From those few people. <b> and burn them with fire</b>  This represents  Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, whom the king of Babylon burnt with fire (Jer.29:  21f.). <b> therefrom a fire will emerge</b>  From these allusions that I give you, retribution will emerge to all  the house of Israel.  <b> 5</b>  <b> among the nations I have placed it</b>  In the middle of the world.  <b> 6</b>  <b> But she exchanged My judgments</b>  Heb.  ותמר , she exchanged My judgments. <b> nations</b>  For so it is written concerning Manasseh (II Chron. 33:9): And Manasseh misled Judah and  the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do evil more than the nations that the Lord had destroyed from before  the children of Israel. Some interpret this to mean that the nations did not accept His Torah, but they  [Israel] did accept it upon themselves, and transgressed it.  <b> 7</b>  <b> Because you have prepared yourselves</b>  Because you have prepared yourselves to be more  profligate than the nations. [The word]  המנכם  is an expression of (Dan 1:5): And the king allotted  (וימן)  [food] for them. Menachem, though, interpreted it as an expression of stirring, like (Ps. 46:  7): Nations have stirred  (המו) . <b> did not do</b>  For they did not exchange their gods, although they are not gods, but you exchanged My  glory for something that avails not. Our Sages (Sanh. 39b) explained: You did not do as the virtuous  ones among them, you did as the corrupt ones among them.  <b> 8</b>  <b> I too</b>  You betrayed Me, and I too, behold I am upon you.  <b> 13</b>  <b> and I shall cause My fury against them to subside</b>  When I avenge Myself against them, My fury  will subside, and My spirit will not oppress Me. <b> and I shall be comforted</b>  Heb.  והנחמתי . And I shall  be comforted from the pain that you inflicted upon Me.  <b> 14</b>  <b> a ruin</b>  Heb.  לחרבה , destroyer in Old French, to make desolate, destroy.  <b> 15</b>  <b> and a taunt</b>  A disgrace. <b> a chastisement</b>  Heb.  מוסר  torments. <b> and an astonishment</b>  A wonder.  <b> 16</b>  <b> and I shall add a famine upon you</b>  This is the famine of the penny depleted from the pocket. So I  heard. <b> your staff of bread</b>  Support of bread.   <b> Chapter 6</b>  <b> 3</b>  <b> and to the hills</b>  [Heb. [ ולגבעות  is] a term expressing height. <b> and to the valleys</b>  [ ולגאיות  is] a term  expressing valleys.  <b> 4</b>  <b> your sun gods</b>   חמניכם , a class of pagan idols made on the roofs [dedicated] to the sun.  <b> 6</b>  <b> and shown to be guilty</b>  Heb.  ויאשמו  [lit. they be made guilty.] They will be recognized for their  guilt.  <b> 9</b>  <b> And those of you that escape will remember Me</b>  My kindnesses and My compassion, that I had  compassion on them when they committed iniquities before Me in their land. <b> straying heart</b>  That I yielded to them. Although their heart went astray and they turned away from  Me, I begged of them, through My prophets, to return to Me, and [promised] that I will [then] do good  for them, but they were unwilling. <b> and they will quarrel with themselves</b>  Heb.  ונקטו . Menachem  associated it with (Ps. 119:158): I saw traitors, and I quarreled  (ואתקוטטה) . They will quarrel with  themselves for not listening to Me. Jonathan renders:  וידנקון  and they will see, and so does he  translate (below 9:4): those who groan  (הנאנקים) ,  דמדנקין , and (Mal. 2:13): weeping...and  groaning  (ואנקה) ,  דמדנקן , demonir in Old French, to groan.  <b> 11</b>  <b> and stamp</b>  Its context implies that it means to stamp ones foot on the ground to flatten out the  mud, and this is a custom of a mourner. <b> and say, Ah!</b>  A cry of grief and woe.  <b> 12</b>  <b> and who is in the siege</b>  Heb.  והנצור , one who is gathered into the city when they besiege it. <b> I shall spend My fury</b>  I shall finish all My fury and My desire to do evil to them.  <b> 13</b>  <b> terebinth</b>  Heb.  אלה , planzon in Old French, a branch. <b> branchy</b>   עבתה , an expression of (below 20:  28): a branchy  (עבות)  tree, i.e., whose branches are many.  <b> 14</b>  <b> a desolation</b>  Heb.  שממה , without an inhabitant. <b> and an astonishment</b>  Heb.  ומשמה , a wonder, i.e.,  that all who see it will wonder about it.   <b> Chapter 7</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> The end has come</b>  Because I had said (Deut. 4:25): and you will have grown old  (ונושנתם)  in the  land, and you will practice corruption, etc., so that you will be lost. [The word]  ונושנתם  has the  numerical value of 852, but they stayed there for [only] 850 years: 440 from the time they entered it  until the Temple was built, and [then] the Temple stood 410 years.  <b> 5</b>  <b> An evil, a singular evil</b>  Heb.  רעה אחתרעה , a total, special evil, worse than all evils; that is the  destruction of the Temple. <b> behold it comes</b>  Heb.  באה . Its accent is on the aleph. It is in the present  tense.  <b> 7</b>  <b> The dawn has set</b>  Heb.  באה הצפירה . Its accent is at the beginning of the word, and it is in the past  tense. The  צפירה  has already set. The light of the dawn and the glory has already set. <b> shout of the mountains</b>  [Jonathan renders:] And not to escape into the strongholds of the mountains.  [The word]  הד  means the cry of the announcement to rise and flee to the mountaintops, like (Isa. 16:  10): the shout [of joy]  (הידד)  have I abolished. Also (Jer. 51:1): and they shall raise a battle-cry  (הידד)  against you. The shout of those who carry the load of grapes to the winepress and those who  load on the beam.  <b> 8</b>  <b> Speedily</b>  Heb.  מקרוב , [lit. from close.] Quickly.  <b> 10</b>  <b> Behold the day</b>  Behold the day has come. <b> behold it is coming</b>  The evil. <b> the dawn has gone forth </b> The dawn of the day of the evil. <b> the staff has budded</b>  to strike you. <b> blossomed</b>  The wicked Nebuchadnezzar has revealed himself.  <b> 11</b>  <b> The violence has arisen, etc.</b>  The violence in your hands has risen upon you as a staff of  wickedness to destroy you. <b> neither from them</b>  So said the Holy One, blessed be He, to the Destroyer:  You are not required to spare a soul [from the wicked of Israel], for no good will come from them or  from their children or from their multitude. <b> and no one among them longs</b>  No one among them longs  or gives thought to Me, as in (I Sam. 7:2): and all the house of Israel longed  (וינהו)  for the  Lord. This is an Aramaism: And they longed  (ואתנהיאו)  for My worship, an expression of desire  and longing. Menachem (p. 69) associated it with  יללה , an expression of wailing, and the word retains  only the hey as a radical.  <b> 12</b>  <b> neither will the seller mourn</b>  Although one who sells his field usually grieves, he will not grieve  because you are destined to go into exile.  <b> 13</b>  <b> For the seller will not return to that which was sold</b>  Once he goes into exile, he will not return  and will no longer see the field that he had sold; so why should he mourn? <b> as long as they are alive </b> All the days of their lives they will not return to their place. <b> all her multitude, etc.</b>  For the prophets prophesy concerning all their multitude to repent, but they do  not repent. <b> and each mans soul is in his iniquity</b>  The life and soul of every one of them is attached  to his iniquity. <b> they do not strengthen themselves</b>  They do not strengthen their heart over their evil  inclination, to return to their Torah.  <b> 14</b>  <b> They sound the shofar</b>  When the enemy comes upon them, they prepare themselves for war, but  no one will go out to fight.  <b> 16</b>  <b> like the doves of the valleys</b>  It is customary for doves to congregate in the valleys and moan there.  They [the survivors] will moan on the mountains, where they will flee, each one for his iniquity, like  the doves of the valleys, which all moan.  <b> 17</b>  <b> will go [like] water</b>  from the sweat of fright.  <b> 19</b>  <b> will be repugnant</b>  It will be disgusting for them.  <b> 20</b>  <b> And the beauty of His adornment</b>  of the Holy One, blessed be He, that He made for their pride.  This is the Temple, called the pride of their might, as it is said (24:21): Behold I profane My  sanctuary, the pride of Your might. They made in it the images of their abominations, therefore, etc.  <b> 22</b>  <b> My secret place</b>  The place where I was hidden among them.  <b> 23</b>  <b> Make the chain</b>  Heb.  הרתוק , the chain. It is a symbolic sign that they will go into exile bound in  fetters. <b> crimes of bloodshed</b>  [lit. judgment of blood. Targum renders:] Crimes deserving of death.  <b> 24</b>  <b> the most wicked of the nations</b>  Heb.  רעי גוים . The most wicked and cruel of the nations. <b> they will deliver as an inheritance</b>  Heb.  ונחלו , they will give over to others as an inheritance. <b> meeting places</b>  Heb.  מקדשיהם . The temples of the high places, where they would gather at appointed  times; an expression of a house of their appointment.  <b> 25</b>  <b> A cutting off comes</b>  Heb.  קפדה  like (Isa. 38:12): I severed  (קפדתי)  like a weaver, my life; a  term denoting cutting off.  <b> 26</b>  <b> Happening upon happening</b>  Heb.  הוה על-הוה , happening upon happening, being after being.  Menachem (p. 70) associated it to a term for a breach. <b> and instruction will be lost from a priest</b>  who  usually gave instruction, as is said (Mal. 2:7): and teaching should be sought from his mouth.   <b> Chapter 8</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> in the sixth year</b>  of the exile of Jeconiah.  <b> 2</b>  <b> from the appearance of its loins, etc.</b>  It is forbidden to reflect on this verse.  <b> 3</b>  <b> by a lock of my hair</b>  Heb.  ציציתראשי  [lit. fringes of my head.] By the hair of my head, flozel in Old  French, a lock of hair. <b> in the visions of God</b>  He showed me [a vision looking] as if He were carrying  me and bringing me to Jerusalem. <b> the inner gate that faces north</b>  The gate to the court, which is  within the Temple Mount, [and] which had gates to all its sides. <b> the image of jealousy</b>  The image of  jealousy would make the Holy One, blessed be He, jealous and provoke Him, for they put it there to  make the Holy One, blessed be He, jealous; to anger Him, and so did Jonathan render: the image of  jealousy, which they provoked.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Now lift your eyes northward</b>  Toward the Temple Mount, outside the court. For he [already]  was standing outside the northern entrance of the court, and north of the gate is [farther] outside the  court. <b> from the north of the gate of the altar</b>  On the Temple Mount, from the north of that northern  gate of the court, and I say that that gate was exactly in line with the gate of the altar. <b> at the entrance </b> Heb.  בבאה . When a person comes to enter the court, he finds it there; a lentree in French, at the  entrance.  <b> 6</b>  <b> to cause Me to distance Myself from My sanctuary</b>  In order that I distance Myself from My  sanctuary.  <b> 7</b>  <b> to the entrance of the court</b>  He brought me up until the entrance of that very gate. <b> wall</b>  The wall of the court.  <b> 8</b>  <b> dig now in the wall</b>  and widen the hole. <b> and behold an entrance</b>  Through the hole, I saw the  entrance of one chamber.  <b> 10</b>  <b> of detestation</b>  Made for the detestation of idolatry. <b> engraved</b>  Heb.  מחקה , engraved on the wall.  <b> 11</b>  <b> and Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan</b>  He was of high esteem, and his generation was learning from  him; therefore, He took particular offense at him. <b> and a thick cloud of incense</b>  Heb.  עתר , thick. The  ascent of the smoke of the cloud of the incense [was thick]. The word  עתר  denotes immensity, and so  (35:13): and have magnified  (העתרתם)  your words against Me, and so (Prov. 27:6): whereas kisses  of an enemy are burdensome  (נעתרות) . Menachem (p. 140) grouped all three under one heading and  they all denote an idea of thickness, but each one is an independent expression.  <b> 12</b>  <b> in his paved chambers</b>  Heb.  משכיתו . Covered with a floor of marble. An expression related to  (Exod. 32:22): and I will cover  (ושכתי)  you with My hand.  <b> 14</b>  <b> to the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord</b>  Within the inner space of the courtyard [that  led] to the entrance of the heichal that is in the north, for the master [R. Jose the son] taught: Two  wickets were in the Temple chamber for the knives, one in the north and one in the south (see Zev.  55b, 56a). <b> making the Tammuz weep</b>  There was an image that they would heat up from the inside,  and its eyes, which were of lead, would melt from the heat of the fire, and it would appear as though it  was weeping, and they would say, It is asking for an offering. Tammuz is an expression of  heating, like (Dan. 3:19): more than it was wont to be heated  (למזיה)  ; (ibid. 22), and the furnace  exceedingly hot  (אזה) . Making the Tammuz cry is fesant plorer la chalfez in Old French; making the  heated [god] weep.  <b> 16</b>  <b> And He brought me to the inner court of the house of the Lord</b>  This is the Temple court, for the  Temple Mount is called the outer court, and until now that is where he [already] had been standing,  except that he had entered the northern gate when He showed him the image of the Tammuz in the  chamber of the knives. Then He brought him to the east, [to stand] before the Temple and the altar. <b> and their faces toward the east</b>  From the implication of the statement, and their faces toward the  east, I [already] know that  their backs were toward the Temple, but [Scripture] tells us that their  posteriors were exposed, for they would uncover themselves and excrete downward. <b> prostrating themselves</b>  Heb.  משתחויתם . This serves as two words, an expression of destruction  (השחתה)  and an expression of prostrating oneself  (השתחויה) . So it is in Yerushalmi (Suc. 5:5, see Korban  Haedah): They were destroying the Temple and bowing to the sun. Jonathan, too, rendered in that  manner: and they were destroying and bowing. Menachem (p. 171) classified it as an expression of  bending down, like (Isa. 51:23): Bend down  (שחי)  and let us cross.  <b> 17</b>  <b> Was it [too] trivial to the house of Judah</b>  Is it trivial and light in their eyes, the other sins that  they have committed? <b> to prevent them from performing the abominations</b>  that they should refrain  from doing all the abominations that they have done in My house here? <b> the land with violence</b>  and that that iniquity is trivial in their eyes, and they repeatedly provoke Me  within My house with these abominations. <b> and behold they send disgrace into their nose</b>  Behold  they send to their nose the foul odor of this song, which they sing with the wind emerging from  their anus; i.e., this disgrace of theirs will come back to their faces. Menachem (p. 79) explained: and  behold they send the disgrace into their nose is a matter of disgrace and shame; and according to his  explanation, He compares the aroma of their censers and (Ezek. 20:28) the anger of their  sacrifices and (ibid.) their pleasant aroma to the work of the disgrace of the orifices. Their backs  to the Temple of the Lord implies this idea.   <b> Chapter 9</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Bring near those appointed over the city</b>  Bring near the appointees whom I appointed to destroy  the city.  <b> 2</b>  <b> six men</b>  Our Rabbis explained them in Tractate Shabbath (55a) as Anger, Wrath, Fury, Destroyer,  Breaker, Annihilator. <b> his sledgehammer</b>  Heb.  כלי מפצו , which smashes everything, as in (Ps. 137:  9): and dash  (ונפץ)  your infants. <b> with a scribes tablet</b>  [Synonymous with]  פנקס . These are wax-  covered tablets upon which they engrave with a stylus. <b> beside the copper altar</b>  This was the stone  altar erected by Solomon instead of the copper altar that Moses had made in the desert.  <b> 3</b>  <b> from upon the cherub</b>  which was on the Ark cover, for the Shechinah had been resting there until  then, and it began to withdraw and to go outside little by little in ten steps, and this is the first stepfrom  the cherub to the threshold of the Holy of Holies.  <b> 4</b>  <b> and you shall mark a sign</b>  You shall mark a sign on the foreheads of the righteous men in order to  be for a sign that the destroyers should not strike them.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And to these, He said in my ears</b>  To these six destroyers.  <b> 6</b>  <b> and you shall commence from My sanctuary</b>  From those standing before My sanctuary. Our  Rabbis said: Do not read  וממקדשי , and from My sanctuary, but  וממקדשי , and from My sanctified  ones, from those sanctified to Me. They are the ones marked with the sign, whom He had warned  [them] not to hurt. [Now] He reneged and commanded [the angels] to destroy [even] them because the  Divine standard of justice contended before Him, Why are these different from those? Is it not so that  they did not protest? As is stated in Tractate Shabbath (55a).  <b> 8</b>  <b> that I remained</b>  Heb.  ונאשאר , and I remained.  <b> 9</b>  <b> full of perversion</b>  Crooked judgments.   <b> Chapter 10</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> over the heads of the cherubim</b>  Over the heads of the four living beings of the Chariot. In this  chapter, he switches over to calling them [all] cherubim because the face of the ox was transformed  into the face of a cherub, as it is written in this chapter. Our Rabbis said (Chag. 13b): Ezekiel begged  for mercy and transformed it to a cherub. He said before Him, Master of the world, an accuser  cannot become a defender.  <b> 2</b>  <b> between the wheels</b>  Heb.  (בינותלגלגל)  [lit. between the wheel.] Wherever it says, And he said...  and he said, it is meant only to be expounded upon. The Holy One, blessed be He, told Gabriel [to  take the coals], but he [Gabriel] asked the cherub to [take them first and then] give them to him so that  the coals would cool and the decree would be mitigated. And this is clearly stated in the chapter (verse  7): and he picked up [the fire] and gave [it] into the hands of the one clothed in linen. <b> [them] upon the city</b>  He did not cast them immediately, and although the one clothed in linen  received them, he did not cast them until six years after he had received them, for the coals were  smoldering in his hand for all the six years. And you should know [that this is true] because this  prophecy was said in the sixth year, and the city was destroyed in the eleventh year.  <b> 3</b>  <b> at the right of the House</b>  In the south [of the Temple]. <b> the inner court</b>  This is the Temple court.  <b> 4</b>  <b> onto the threshold of the House</b>  That is the very [stage of] evacuation mentioned above (9:3).  <b> 5</b>  <b> until the outer court</b>  The Temple Mount. I may think that [it was heard no further] because the  sound was low. Therefore, Scripture states: like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks. Yet,  when it would reach the outer court, it would [suddenly] stop.  <b> 9</b>  <b> and behold four wheels</b>  Since one of the faces was changed, it was necessary to repeat here the  entire account of the living beings as at first, so that you should not say that it is another Chariot.  <b> 12</b>  <b> and their hubs</b>  Heb.  וידיהם  of the wheels. They are the hole in which the [axle of the] chariot  turns, called boyol, nave, hub. Jonathan, however, renders:  ואשדתהון , and their pourings. <b> wheels</b>  To the four wheels of the living beings.  <b> 13</b>  <b> to them was called hagalgal to my ears</b>  I heard that the angel would call the wheel galgal. <b> called hagalgal</b>  to them was called the name galgal.  <b> 14</b>  <b> the face of one was the face of the cherub</b>  That was the face of the ox, which was transformed  into a cherub.  <b> 19</b>  <b> at the entrance of the...gate of the House of the Lord</b>  The entrance of the heichal. <b> the eastern </b> Heb.  הקדמוני , that is in the east. This was the second stage of the evacuation, from the threshold of  the Holy of Holies to the court.  <b> 20</b>  <b> It was the living being</b>  Since I saw in this Chariot the entire phenomenon of the first Chariot, I  say [It] is the one I saw by the river Chebar. <b> and I knew</b>  that the face of the ox was transformed  into the face of a cherub, and there were in it two faces of man: a small face of a child and a large face  of a man.   <b> Chapter 11</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> and behold at the entrance of the gate [twenty-five men]</b>  They are the very same ones that he  mentioned above (ad loc.): their backs to the Temple of the Lord except that he did not explain  there who they were, and here he delineates the names of two of them.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Who say, It is not near</b>  that the words of the prophets will come upon us. <b> build houses</b>  We need  not be concerned with them; rather build houses in which to dwell, for we shall not be exiled from this  city until we die. <b> it is the pot, and we are the meat</b>  Just as the meat is not taken out of the pot until it  has been completely cooked, neither shall we leave it until we die.  <b> 5</b>  <b> So have you said</b>  I know that you have said this, that Jerusalem is the pot and you are the meat, but  I say to you that for the slain whom you have laid in it, it becomes a pot, for they are finished in it; but  for you, it will not become a pot to retain you until the day of death, for you I shall take out of it. <b> what enters your mind</b>  [lit. what goes up in your spirit.] What goes up on your thoughts, votre talant  in Old French, your mind [intentions].  <b> 7</b>  <b> take out</b>  Heb.  הוציא , like  להוציא  to take out.

But they did not heed him, and they had to  do just that. This is what is written in the Book of Lamentations (3:16): Indeed, He made my teeth  grind on gravel. In Midrash Lamentations. <b> and go into exile day by day</b>  Heb.  יומם , from day to day,  two or three days, behave like a man preparing his steps for exile, so that the people of the exile will  see and ask what you are doing, and you shall tell them that it symbolizes Zedekiah and his people [in  Jerusalem], and these people will send their messengers and inform their brothers and relatives who  are there, according to everything they hear from your mouth. Likewise, every [occurrence of]  יומם  in Scripture is an expression denoting day by day, something that goes on [continually] for many  days. This I heard in the name of Rabbi Menachem, and his words are true. <b> perhaps they will see </b> Perhaps they will understand, apercevront in French, they will realize. <b> for a rebellious house are they </b> Therefore, it is still a perhaps.  <b> 4</b>  <b> like the departures of</b>  Heb.  כמוצאי , come issues, essues in Old French, [comme les issues in  modern French] like the departures.  <b> 5</b>  <b> dig for yourself in the wall</b>  Symbolic of Zedekiah, who [later] went out through a tunnel [leading  into] a cave, for he was afraid to go out in the open because of the Chaldeans.  <b> 6</b>  <b> in the dark you shall bring [them] out</b>  When it becomes dark, you shall bring out your implements.  <b> 7</b>  <b> I brought out my implements as implements for exile, from day to day</b>  Every day, I would show  them that I was preparing for myself implements for exile.  <b> 10</b>  <b> [Concerning] the prince is this burden</b>  Concerning King Zedekiah, I am showing this  משא ,  burden, an expression denoting prophecy.  <b> 12</b>  <b> He will cover his face</b>  because of shame, that he is fleeing from the city at night.  <b> 13</b>  <b> And I shall spread my net over him</b>  There was a cave [extending] from his house to the plains of  Jericho, and he went out through the cave.

And when Zedekiah emerged from the cave in the plains of Jericho, they saw  him emerging and caught him. <b> but he will not see it</b>  because in Riblah in the land of Hamath, he  [Nebuchadnezzar] called him to account and blinded his eyes.

All of them with one accord for evil. Therefore, it is  said:  ויבוא , and came [the singular form].

Or himself: first a prince over all the princes,  eventually cast into a lions den, and [ultimately] restored to his greatness. Likewise, Job saw himself  well-established, destroyed, and [again] well-established. Therefore, they were brought as a parallel to  the generation of Jeconiah, which saw the Temple while it was built and while it was destroyed, and  the [Temples] second building. And the Holy One, blessed be He, said the following to them: I am  showing you great affectionyou, Jeconiah and [those of] his exile. Should one of the lands of the  nations sin against Me and had I decreed upon it one of these four punishmentseither famine (verse  13), wild beast (verse 15), the sword (verse 17), or pestilence (verse 19) as they appear in this  chapter, consecutively, and these three righteous men were in its midst, they would save neither son  nor daughter. Yet I will bring [all] four of them on [your brethren in] Jerusalem, and [still] leave over  for you some of your sons who are there although you are not in its midst. And not because they are  worthy of being saved, but to console you when they are exiled [to an area] near you and you will see  their evil deeds and be consoled about the evil that I brought upon them. For you will see that it could  no longer be tolerated. [The annotator of our ms. remarks:] (This is the theme of this entire chapter.  This [following] explanation cannot be made fit, and it appears that it is not the wording of the rabbi  [viz. Rashi]. It appears further that this edition [of Rashi in which this comment was found] is missing  one of the four punishments, from  או , or, until  כי  or.) Another explanation: <b> etc.</b>  and had these three men been in its midst [namely] Noah, Daniel, and Job because the Holy One,  blessed be He, saved these three men from these three [four] judgments, Scripture mentioned these.  Noah was saved from the three of them. How do we know [that he was saved] from wild beasts?  When he entered the ark, all the beasts attempted to enter, but the Holy One, blessed be He, did not  allow them, as it is written (Gen. 7:16): and the Lord shut around him. Now the word shut refers  only to protection from beasts, as Scripture states (Dan. 6:23): and he shut the lions mouths, and  they did not hurt me.A lion came to enter [the ark] and its teeth were set on edge; a bear came to  enter, and its feet would totter, etc. (see Gen. Rabbah 31:12). How do we know [that he was saved]  from famine?For it is said (Gen. 5:29): from the soil, which the Lord has cursed. Go out and learn  Genesis Rabbah (25:3) where it enumerates the ten famines that descended upon the world, and you  will find that one of them was in the time of Noah, and it brings proof from from the soil, which...  [He] cursed. From the swordthis is the Flood, and moreover, the people of his generation sought to  attack him, saying, We will not allow him to enter, but the Holy One, blessed be He, saved him: said  the Holy One, blessed be He, I will not allow him to enter except at midday [in broad daylight], and  whomever it hurtslet him protest. That is what is written (Gen. 7:13): In this very  (עצם)  day Noah  came [into the ark] at the strong point  (עצומו)  of the day. Danielwhen Nebuchadnezzar entered the  Temple in the days of Jehoiakim, he slew Jehoiakim and spared Daniel. He expelled Daniel [into] a  peaceful exile because he found him to be full of a spirit of wisdom. From faminefor until Jerusalem  was conquered in the days of Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar besieged it for three years [during which it  suffered a famine], as is said (II Kings 25:3): the famine became severe in the city, and also (in Jer.  52:6): and the famine became severe. How do we know [that he was saved] from beasts?and shut  the lions mouths (Dan. ibid.), and they did not hurt me. Likewise, you find that Job was saved from  the three of them. How do we know [that he was saved] from famine?According to the one who says  (Baba Bathra 15b) that Job lived in the time of Jacob, we find that there was a famine in his days.  How do we know [that he was protected] from beasts?For it is written (Job 1:10): and his cattle has  broken out into the land. It has breached the [natural] limitations of the world. [Usually wolves kill  goats, but Jobs goats killed wolves; B. B. 15b.] How do we know [that he survived] the sword?(ibid.  16:13) He splits my kidneys and does not have compassion. <b> midst[namely] Noah, Daniel, and Job, they would save themselves with their righteousness.</b>  Why  are sons and daughters not mentioned [in verse 14] in regard to the death by faminei.e., it is not stated  about them, [as I lived] if they will save sons or daughters!as they are mentioned in the last two  punishments (verses 16, 18)? This is to depict Daniel, for he was one of those three saved from famine,  he was of the generation of Jeconiah, and neither sons nor daughters were rescued with him.  Concerning him Isaiah prophesied (56:4): [For] so says the Lord to the to the eunuchs who will keep  My Sabbaths.  <b> 15</b>  <b> If...wild beasts</b>  Heb.  לו . If wild beasts.  <b> 17</b>  <b> sword</b>  Troops for battle.  <b> 21</b>  <b> How much more</b>  Heb.  אף כי , an expression of an a fortiori and how much more so. It is the same  throughout Scripture, like (I Sam. 23:3): Behold we are afraid here in Judah; how much more so  (אף  כי)  if we go to Keilah... ? Likewise, in this chapter (15:5): Behold when it was whole, it could not  be used for work; how much less  (אף כי)  when fire has consumed it, etc.? <b> My judgments</b>  Mes justises  in Old French, my punishments.  <b> 22</b>  <b> remains</b>  Heb.  נותרה , iyert rem[n]s in Old French, will have remained. <b> who are being brought out </b> in captivity, and they will bring them here. <b> their deed</b>  Heb.  עלילותם , their deeds.   <b> Chapter 15</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> what will become of the vine tree out of all [other] trees</b>  How will its end be different from that of  all other trees? <b> the branch that was among the trees of the forest</b>  Not about the vine of the  vineyards, which produces fruit, am I asking you, but about the branch of a vine that grows in the  forest.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Will...be taken from it, etc.</b>  It is not for that. <b> any utensil</b>  Heb.  כל כלי .  <b> 4</b>  <b> Behold, [if] it were given to the fire to be consumed</b>  Adevorer in Old French, to be devoured,  consumed. Behold I asked you about a whole one, which is not fit for anything. Now I shall add more  to the question: Behold if they put a branch of it into the fire, and the fire consumed it at its two ends  of its outer surface until its inside became charred... <b> were charred</b>  Heb.  נחר , blackened from the fire,  brouir in French, to blacken, to scorch.  נחר  derives from the same form found in (Job 30:30): and my  bones dried out  (חרה)  from the heat. Some translate this as e(s)sart in Old French, calcined, burnt to  ashes, as [its sense] in Hosea (8:5) and also in (Job 19:11): He has kindled  (ויחר)  His wrath against  me. Menachem (p. 93) [however] related it to my bones dried out. <b> is it fit</b>  [Is it] still fit for work?  <b> 6</b>  <b> have I placed</b>  Jerusalem. Its two ends were consumed by the fire, [i.e.,] the two exiles: When  Jehoiakim was exiled, some of the royal seed and of the nobles were exile with him, as it is said in  Daniel (1:3). After him were exiled his son Jeconiah and the craftsmen and the gate sentries. And its  inside was charred [based on above, verse 4]Concerning Zedekiah, the one who remained therein, I  have already decreed (10:2): and fill your hands with fiery coals...and cast [them] onto the city.  <b> 7</b>  <b> From the fire they have emerged</b>  They transgressed the words of the Torah, which were given  from fire, and nations as strong as fire will destroy them.   <b> Chapter 16</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> let...know</b>  Heb.  הודע , fais savoir in French, inform.  <b> 3</b>  <b> your dwelling place</b>  Heb.  מכרתיך , like  מגורותיך , your dwelling place [interchanging  כ  and  ג ], and  Menachem (p. 110) connected the word to the idea of birth. He similarly explained (Gen. 49:  5): weapons of violence are their birth  (מכרותיהם)   (Deut. 18:8); besides what he has from his birth  (ממכריו)   (II Kings 12:6); each one from his kinsman  (מכרו) . They all mean birth. <b> etc., and your mother</b>  Abraham and Sarah took their greatness from there, and the children of Heth  gave her a grave.  <b> 4</b>  <b> on the day you were born</b>  Heb.  הולדת , fus nee in French. When I chose you in Egypt, you were  without any preparation, and because he compares the matter to birth, he mentions here the  preparations of the newborn. <b> your navel</b>  Heb.  שרך , like  שררך . <b> for cleansing</b>  Heb.  למשעי , to make  smooth, [as] (below 24:7),the smoothness of the rock  (צחיח סלע)   is translated  שעיעותכיפא , apla[ni]  ment in Old French, clearing, smoothing. Menachem (p. 177) associates it to the word for dandling  (שעשוע) . <b> nor were you salted</b>  From here it is derived that we salt the newborn so that his flesh  hardens. <b> nor swaddled</b>  Heb.  והחתל , a word denoting enwrapping with garments, and likewise (Job 38:  9): and the dark cloud its wrapping  (חתלתו)   It is [the cloth with] which they swathe the infant.  <b> 5</b>  <b> to have mercy</b>  Heb.  לחמלה , to pity. <b> in the loathsomeness</b>  Heb.  בגעל  an [a]borissemant, in  abhorrence, loathing.  <b> 6</b>  <b> downtrodden</b>  Heb.  מתבוססת , downtrodden, as (Ps. 60:14): and He will trample  (יבוס)  our  adversaries. <b> With your blood, live</b>  Even with this loathsomeness of yours you shall not die. He  repeats this a second time because they were redeemed with the blood of the Passover sacrifice and  the blood of circumcision (Pirke dRabbi Eliezer, chapter 29). Another explanation of  מתבוססת : souillee  in French, soiled, sullied.  <b> 7</b>  <b> with perfect beauty</b>  Heb.  בעדי עדים , [a form] expressing perfection. But Menachem (p. 131)  explained  בעדי עדים  as related to the word  עד , eternity, as (Isa. 26:4): Trust in the Lord forever  (עדי עד)  ; enjusque a s(i)egle in Old French, to eternity [lit. for centuries]. Dunash (p. 83),  however, interpreted it as a word for ornaments. The declension of  עדי עדים  is one of the ten nouns:  lion, lions  (ארי ארים)  ; deer [sing.], deer [pl.]  (צבי צבים)  ; kid, kids  (גדי גדים) . <b> fashioned</b>  Heb.  נכנו , furent efeties in Old French, were fashioned, developed. <b> and your hair grown</b>  Signs of  puberty.  <b> 8</b>  <b> love</b>  Heb.  דדים , amities in French; friendship, love.  <b> 9</b>  <b> and I anointed you</b>  Heb.  ואסכך , a word expressing anointing. Now the entire episode is only a  parable, and Jonathan explained it all, leaving nothing to add to the Targum, and he explained it in this  manner: <b> [3] Your dwelling place and your birthplace, etc.</b>  Your dwelling place and your birthplace  are from the land of the Canaanites; there I revealed Myself to your father Abraham [in the covenant]  between the parts, and I let him know that you are going down to Egypt. With an arm raised on high, I  redeemed you, and through the merit of your fathers, I drove out the Amorites and destroyed the  Hittites. <b> [4] And as for your birth, on the day you were born, etc.</b>  And also, when your forefathers  went down to Egypt, sojourners in a land that was not theirs, they subjugated them and oppressed  them. The assembly of Israel was like a newborn infant abandoned in the open field, whose navel was  not cut, and who was not rinsed with water to be cleansed, and not salted with salt or swaddled with  swaddling clothes. <b> [5] No eye pitied you, etc.</b>  The eye of the wicked Pharaoh did not pity you to do  you any favor, to lighten your bondage, [or] to have pity on you, and he decreed upon you a decree of  annihilation, to cast your males into the river to destroy you at the time you were in Egypt. <b> passed by you, etc.</b>  And the remembrance of the covenant of your forefathers came before Me. I  revealed Myself to redeem you because it was known to Me that you were being oppressed in your  bondage, and I said to you, With the blood of the circumcision I shall spare you, and I said, With  the blood of the Passover, I shall redeem you. <b> you</b>  Myriads, as the plants of the field, I have made you, and you have increased and become strong,  and you have become families and tribes, and with the good deeds of your forefathers, the time of the  redemption of your assembly arrived because you were subjugated and oppressed. <b> plants of the field I made you</b>  as it is said (Exod. 1:7): And the children of Israel were fruitful and  increased. <b> but you were naked and bare</b>  of the commandments. <b> [8] And I passed by you, etc</b>  And I  revealed Myself to Moses in the thorn bush because it was revealed to Me that the time of your  redemption had arrived. I shielded you with My word, and I removed your sins, and I swore by My  word to redeem you as I swore to your forefathers, said the Lord God, that you should be a people  serving before Me. <b> and I spread My skirt</b>  The skirt of My garment. <b> and I swore to you</b>  (Exod. 6:  6): Therefore  (לכן) , say to the children of Israel: I am the Lord! I shall take you out,  etc. Therefore means only an [introduction to an] oath, as it is said (I Sam. 3:14): therefore, I have  sworn to the house of Eli... <b> and came into a covenant with you</b>  (Exod. 24:8): Behold the blood of  the covenant that the Lord has made with you. <b> [9] and I washed you with water</b>  And I redeemed  you from the bondage of the Egyptians, and I removed the strength of their lordship from you, and I  led you to freedom.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And I clothed you with embroidered garments</b>  And I clothed you with embroidered garments  of the spoils of your enemies. <b> and I shod you with badger</b>  [Jonathan renders:] And I put shoes of  glory on your feet. <b> and I girded you</b>  Heb.  ואחבשך . [Jonathan renders:] and I hallowed priests of you  to be serving before Me with turbans of fine linen. <b> and I covered you with silk</b>  Heb.  משי , soie in  French. And the High Priest with colored raiment, and [according to] Midrash Aggadah (Mid. Song  4:2), these are the seven clouds of glory, as it is written (Exod. 13:22): He did not move  (ימיש)  the  pillar of cloud by day.  <b> 11</b>  <b> And I adorned you with ornaments</b>  E pare toy, and I adorned you. [Jonathan renders:] And I  adorned you with the adornment of the words of the Torah, written on the two stone tablets. <b> and I put </b> Heb.  ואתנה  [lit. and I gave,] through Moses. <b> bracelets</b>  Heb.  צמידים  [from  צמד , to join]. I joined  one commandment opposite the other, five opposite five.  <b> 12</b>  <b> And I put a nose ring on your nose</b>  [Jonathan renders:] And I placed the ark of My covenant  among you. <b> and earrings on your ears</b>  Heb.  ועגילים , a word for an earring. [Jonathan interprets:]  And the cloud of My glory covering over you. [The clouds of glory are called  ועגילים ] because they  surrounded them in a circle  (עגול) . <b> and a crown of glory on your head</b>  [Jonathan renders:] And an  angel was sent from before Me leading at your head, as it is said (Micah 2:13): and their king passed  before them, and the Lord was at their head.  <b> 13</b>  <b> And you adorned yourself with gold and silver</b>  [Jonathan renders:] And I placed My Tabernacle  among you, adorned with gold, silver, curtains of linen, colored tapestries and embroidery, and  mannawhich was as good as fine flour, honey and oilI fed you, and you became exceedingly rich and  strong, and you prospered and ruled over all the kingdoms. <b> fine flour, honey, and oil you ate</b>  The  manna, which would change to any flavorto fine flour, honey, and oilyou ate. The Midrash Aggadah  (Mid. Song 4:2) [points out that] thirteen items are enumerated here, and corresponding to them, the  Holy One, blessed be He, ordered them to bring the thirteen items enumerated in the donation for the  Tabernacle (Exod. 25:1-7). Nevertheless, He is destined to repay them in the future with thirteen items  (Isa. 4:5f.): And the Lord shall create over every dwelling of Mount Zion, etc. And a tabernacle shall  be for shade by day from the heat, etc., from stream and from rain, etc. <b> beautiful</b>  An expression of beauty.  <b> 14</b>  <b> for it is all inclusive</b>  Heb.  כליל , an expression of all-inclusive beauty (23:12). Another  explanation:  כי כליל הוא , for it was perfect. Another explanation:  כי כליל  couronne in French, like  (Lev. 21:12): crown  (נזר) , which is translated  כליל  by Targum.  <b> 15</b>  <b> and you went astray because of your fame</b>  You relied on the fame of the beauty that spread  concerning you. <b> and you poured out your harlotries</b>  You displayed your beauty to every passerby  until the lust for your harlotry gushed upon them [arousing them] to seduce you into fornicating with  them. <b> to him it would be</b>  And once they desired you, you surrendered yourself to them; and to  anyone who requested your harlotry, it would be his. Jonathan renders: and it was not fitting for you to  do so, as though it were written  לא יהי . This entire allegory represents the Calf of the desert and the  other idolatry that the tribe of Dan worshipped in the desert, as it is written (Deut. 25:18): all those  who trailed after you, and we find in the Pesikta (dRav Kahana p. 27b): This is the tribe of Dan, for  the cloud would reject them, because the were all idolators.  <b> 16</b>  <b> mounds of colored garments</b>  Covered with spotted garments of various colors, pla[t]rees in Old  French, multi-colored. <b> this should not have come</b>  It was not proper for this to come, non a venir et  non a etre in French, [which was] not to come nor to be.  <b> 17</b>  <b> male images</b>  Since he compares her to a female harlot, he compares the image to a male who  fornicates with her.  <b> 19</b>  <b> And My bread that I gave you</b>  The day they made the Calf, the manna descended for them and  they placed some of it before the Calf. Nonetheless, so it was on the morrow, and it did not cease.  Even this is delineated in the Book of Ezra (Neh. 9:18ff.): Even when they made for themselves a  molten calf, etc. And You, with Your manifold mercies, did not forsake them, etc., and You did not  withhold Your manna from their mouth. It was fitting to withhold it from them, yet You did not  withhold it. [Scripture writes] here, too, so it was, says the Lord God the bread was, and it did not  stop falling on the next day. So did Rabbi Tanchuma expound on it (Buber, Reeh 13a).  <b> 20</b>  <b> that you bore for Me</b>  If one had five sons, four of them were devoted to worshipping idols, and  one he would set aside to attend school; and when he comes to offer up one of his sons to Molech, he  offers up to it this one whom he had set aside to study Torahin the Midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma. But I  say that that you bore for Me refers to the firstborn. Likewise, it is stated in this Book (20:26): And  I defiled them with their gifts, when they caused every one who opened the womb to pass.  <b> 22</b>  <b> the days of your youth</b>  My acts of kindness that I performed for you in Egypt.  <b> 23</b>  <b> Woe, woe is to you</b>  Woe is to you because you have sinned! Woe is to you because you have not  repented!  <b> 24</b>  <b> You built yourself an eminent place</b>  Heb.  גב , a height such as pedestal or an altar. <b> You built </b> Heb.  ותבני , an expression for building.  <b> 25</b>  <b> you spread your legs</b>  Since He compares her to a harlot, He speaks in terms of sexual activity, in  which there is spreading of the legs, a cesmas in Old French, you spread wide apart.  <b> 26</b>  <b> great of flesh</b>  Having a large male organ.  <b> 27</b>  <b> your ration</b>  Your food, in the days that the judges judged. <b> who hate you</b>  in the days of Samson. <b> who were embarrassed by your lewd way</b>  Jonathan  [paraphrases]: For had I sent My prophets to them, they would have humbled themselves, and they  would not have gone in the way of your lewdness.  <b> 28</b>  <b> because you were not sated</b>  Because you were not sated with the abominations of Egypt. <b> played the harlot with them</b>  Heb.  ותזנים , from the term for harlotry  (זנות) , e ansera[s] a els.  <b> 29</b>  <b> with the land of Canaan, with the Chaldeans</b>  The Chaldeans were not from the land of Canaan,  but this is its meaning: You added the images of the Chaldeans to those of the Canaanites, who were  near you, and you played the harlot with them. However Jonathan rendered: You increased your  harlotries with the Chaldeans and You became like the Canaanites, who were steeped in idolatry, and  you increased your gods, joining the people of Canaan who follow the customs of the Chaldeans. But  to me it appears that  כנען  is like  סוחר , a merchant, like (Hosea 12:8): A trafficker  (כנען)  who has  deceitful scales in his hand. He thus calls the land of the Chaldeans the land of the merchants, as it is  said [concerning Babylon, too,] (17:4): and he brought it to the land of merchants  (כנען) , in a city of  traffickers he placed it.  <b> 30</b>  <b> How degenerate</b>  Heb.  אמלה , spoiled. Similarly (Neh. 3:34): the feeble  (האמללים)  Jews, and  similarly (Ps. 6:3), because I languish  (אמלל) . <b> your heart</b>  Heb.  לבתך , like  לבך . <b> dominated</b>  Heb.  שלטת , whose evil inclination dominates her.  <b> 31</b>  <b> When you build your eminent place</b>  Heb.  בבנותיך , like  בבנותך , from the word for building. <b> boast of a hire</b>  Heb.  לקלס , to speak and to boast of the fine hire that they give her. Similarly, every  form of  קלס  is an expression of speech, parliz in Old French, boastful, empty talk. <b> hire</b>  Heb.  אתנן , an  expression for hire, loyez in old French.  <b> 32</b>  <b> the adulterous wife</b>  You are the adulterous wife. <b> who, under her husband, takes strangers </b> While she is under her husband, [she] casts her eyes on others.  <b> 33</b>  <b> gifts</b>  Heb.  נדה , a dowry. <b> because of your harlotries</b>  Because of the great [lust for] harlotry that  was in you, you did so.  <b> 34</b>  <b> there was no such harlotry</b>  No harlotry was done with any harlot like your harlotry.  <b> 36</b>  <b> your bottom was poured out</b>  Heb.  נחשתך . This is a term for a bottom, which is called fonz in old  French, bottom. And so [is this word] many [times] in the [Mishnaic] order of Tohoroth (Kelim 8:  3): the base  (נחשתו)  of a stove. <b> your bottom was poured out</b>  Because of the great lust for harlotry.  your fountain would flow. <b> and because of all your abominable idols</b>  Heb.  ועל . <b> the blood of your sons</b>  And for the iniquity of the blood of your sons I will do to you this evil  delineated in the chapter: Behold I gather etc.  <b> 37</b>  <b> you mingled</b>  Heb.  ערבת , mellas in Old French.  <b> 38</b>  <b> and I shall deliver you [to those who shed] blood with fury and zeal</b>  And I shall deliver you to  those who slay with fury and zeal and anger.  <b> 39</b>  <b> and they will demolish your eminent place</b>  Your tall ceremonial buildings. <b> and your lofty places </b> An expression used for high altars.  <b> 40</b>  <b> and pierce you</b>  Heb.  ובתקוך . There is no similar word elsewhere in Scripture, and Jonathan  rendered  ויבזעוניך , and they will pierce you, e tre[s]perzeront toy in Old French.  <b> 41</b>  <b> and I shall stop you from a harlot</b>  From being a harlot.  <b> 43</b>  <b> behold</b>  Heb.  הא , like  הנה . <b> yet you did not make a plan</b>  Although I have given your way on your  head, you have not made a plan to ponder your abominations, to repent of them. Every  זמה  in  Scripture is an expression of counsel, sometimes for good and sometimes for bad.  <b> 44</b>  <b> whoever uses proverbs</b>  Heb.  המשל . This is an expression of a proverb and a riddle <b> like daughter</b>  Heb.  כאמה בתה . The hey of  כאמה  is not a mappiq [aspirate] hey, [to read her  mother; i.e. it is not the third person possessive] because it does not serve for any noun but it means,  as the mother, so is her daughter.  <b> 45</b>  <b> your mothers daughter</b>  The nation of Canaan, whose land you inherited. <b> husband and her children</b>  Who so increased their abominations that the land spewed forth its  inhabitants, the fathers and the children together. <b> and you are your sisters sister</b>  Sodom, which is  next to the land of Israel. <b> your mother was a Hittite, etc.</b>  Jonathan renders: Is it not so that your  mother Sarah was among the Hittites, yet did not do as their deeds, and your father Abraham was  among the Amorites, yet did not follow their counsel!  <b> 46</b>  <b> at your left</b>  Since the territory of Judah was at the southern border of Eretz Israel [and one is  considered facing east], all the other tribes were situated at their left [since they are north of Judah].  <b> 47</b>  <b> If only you had gone in their ways</b>  Heb.  ולא , if only you had gone in their ways and not  committed abominations more than they. Likewise (II Kings 5:17): Now if only  (ולא)  your servant to  be given. Likewise (I Sam. 20:14): And please, if  (ולא)  I am still alive, concerning Jonathan, et plut  a in French, would that..., if only! <b> so very little</b>  Would your abominations have been before Me, had  you not committed abominations more than they, but you dealt more corruptly than they. This is also  Jonathans rendering. Others interpret  ולא בדרכהן הלכת  as its apparent meaning, and you did not go in  their ways, [and thus follows the reason:] So very little were their abominations in your eyes that you  dealt more corruptly than they, pochet in Old French, a little.  <b> 50</b>  <b> And they became haughty</b>  She and her daughters, as is delineated in Job (28:5): A land from  which bread emerged, and the entire piece (ibid. 4-9). [The Sodomites grew in haughtiness] until they  said, Let us cause the habit of traveling [lit. the foot] to be forgotten from our land, for they come  only to cause us loss. <b> and I removed them when I saw</b>  their way, as the matter that is stated  regarding Sodom (Gen. 18:21): I shall go down and see.  <b> 51</b>  <b> and you vindicated your sisters</b>  Before you had committed abominations more than they, they  would have been a judged guilty, but since you became more wicked than they, you made them  [appear] as righteous women, and you gave them an excuse to say, There are some who have  provoked you more than I.  <b> 52</b>  <b> that you judged</b>  That you judged them; before you behaved more wickedly than they, you used to  say about them that they are fit for punishment.  <b> 53</b>  <b> the captivity of Sodom</b>  Heb.  שבות . I shall cure the land of brimstone and salt, and I shall settle it  with inhabitants. <b> in their midst</b>  Heb.  בתוכהנה , like  בתוכן .  <b> 54</b>  <b> in that you consoled them</b>  when you became more wicked than they, and you gave them an  excuse [to neglect righteousness]. Another explanation: <b> in that you consoled them</b>  When the evil  comes upon you, they will be consoled, saying, We have not suffered alone.  <b> 56</b>  <b> Now, was not Sodom your sister, etc.</b>  This is a [rhetorical] question. <b> a report in your mouth</b>  [by  which] to reprove many and to say, Beware that you should not be overturned like Sodom, as though it  were recent news to you. <b> on the day of your pride</b>  When you were in your greatness.  <b> 57</b>  <b> like [at] the time of the taunt by the daughters of Aram</b>  As it was revealed when I delivered you  into the hands of the kings of Aram, who attacked Ahaz (II Kings 15:36); In those days, the Lord  began to incite Rezin the king of Aram. etc.; (II Chron. 28:5), And the Lord his God delivered him  into the hands of the king of Aram, etc.; (ibid. verse 18), And the Philistines invaded the cities of the  plain and the south, etc. <b> who disgraced you</b>  Heb.  השאטות , an expression for disgrace. The aleph is not  sounded.  ויבז , despised (Gen. 25:34), is translated as  ושט  [in Targum Onkelos].  <b> 58</b>  <b> you bore them</b>  Heb.  נשאתים , you bore them. This is a feminine form [used] in many places in this  Book.  <b> 59</b>  <b> I have done with you, etc.</b>  I have done evil to you commensurate to your [ungrateful] repayment  [to Me] which you made. <b> that you despised an oath, etc.</b>  That one that you accepted upon yourself in  Horeb (Deut. 29:11): That you pass into the covenant of the Lord your God, etc. But I shall not  violate the covenant by not remembering it, because I am not like you.  <b> 60</b>  <b> But I shall remember My covenant</b>  That was with you in the days of your youth.  <b> 61</b>  <b> And you will remember</b>  when I improve you evil ways for you, and you will be humiliated before  Me for repaying Me with evil whereas I paid you with good. <b> when you take your sisters</b>  When you  conquer to inherit the nations that are around you, the small and the great. <b> for daughters</b>  For your  suburbs, subordinate to you, like (verse 55): Sodom and her daughters, [translated by Jonathan as]  וכפרנהא , its suburbs. <b> but not from your covenant</b>  But not because of your observance of the  covenant that I made with you, but because of My kindnesses and My mercies, [namely] that I  observe My covenant. Midrash Aggadah of Rabbi Tanchuma (Buber, Devarim 3a) states: but not from  your covenant  (מבריתך)  not from your patromonia: I did not grant them to Abraham your father [in  the covenant] between the segments (Gen. 15:1). This term is close to the French, for now, kinship is  called patremone, patrimony, and this is what they call anything a person has from the inheritance of  his fathers.  <b> 63</b>  <b> In order that you remember</b>  your way when I do good for you. <b> and be ashamed</b>  to raise your  face to Me. <b> when I forgive you</b>  Heb.  בכפרי לך  [lit. in my atoning to you]. When I forgive you for  what you have done, you will be ashamed, and you will know that I did not benefit you because of the  good that you bestowed upon Me.   <b> Chapter 17</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> propound a riddle</b>  The prophecy in this chapter is expressed as a riddle, [in] which he compares  Nebuchadnezzar to an eagle and the kings of Judah to the lofty top of cedars.  <b> 3</b>  <b> long pinions</b>  Heb.  אבר  like  כנף , wing, aile in French. Another explanation: as its apparent meaning,  an expression of actual limbs. <b> diverse colors</b>  Heb.  קרמה  [lit. embroidered]. Its feathers are beautiful  and ornate. <b> the lofty top of the cedar</b>  Heb.  צמרת , all the foliage of the tree, cime in French. This is a  parable representing Jehoiakim and his mighty men.  <b> 4</b>  <b> He plucked the top of its branches</b>  Heb.  יניקותיו . He humbled his [Jehoiakims] greatness and his  monarchy.  יניקותיו  is like  ענפיו , its branches. <b> and brought to a land of merchants</b>  Heb.  כנען , to  a land of merchants; that is Babylon.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Then he took of the seed of the land</b>  Zedekiah his son. <b> in a fertile field</b>  [lit. in a field of seed.] In  Jerusalem, in the capital city. <b> it took [root] beside abundant waters</b>  Heb.  קח , it took. It became  rooted beside abundant waters, i.e., he gave him greatness and dominion over his surroundings. <b> mountain willow he made it</b>  Heb.  צפצפה , a species of willow tree which has many branches, saice  in Old French, a willow.  <b> 6</b>  <b> spreading</b>  Heb.  סורחת , like (Exod. 26:12): And the overhanging length  (וסרח) , large. <b> of low stature </b> to serve the king of Babylon. <b> its tendrils</b>  Heb.  דליותיו , its branches. <b> to him</b>  to the king of Babylon. <b> under him</b>  under the king of Babylon <b> branches</b>  Heb.  בדים ,staves. <b> and sent forth</b>  It grew. <b> boughs </b> many leaves.  <b> 7</b>  <b> Now there was one...eagle</b>  The king of Egypt. <b> gathered its roots</b>  Heb.  כפנה , an expression of  hunger, like (Job 5:22): plunder and famine  (ולכפן) . The roots of this vine hungered and longed for  that eagle. (Addendum:) Some explain  כפנה  like  אספה , gathered, the letters [of  כפנה ] being  transposed. In the words of our Sages there is something similar to it, for they call a public gathering  כנופיא .  כפנה  is like  כנפה , amassa in French, brought in, gathered. <b> him</b>  And her emissaries she sent to him, to come to her and water her. <b> planting</b>  From the water ditches that the first eagle had made for it.  <b> 8</b>  <b> In a good field, etc.</b>  i.e., she did this for no purpose, because she had been planted in a good field. <b> sturdy vine</b>  Heb.  אדרת , a sturdy vine.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Say</b>  The entire Hebrew alphabet is found in this verse, and I am puzzled that it is not listed in the  Masorah. <b> [Will he not] pull up its roots</b>  The first eagle. <b> and cut off its fruits</b>  Heb.  יקוסס , like  יקוצץ ,  will cut off.

According to Targum, and all his mighty men. But Menachem  (p. 48) associated it with (Song 8:10): Flee  (ברח)  my beloved, and this is its interpretation: and all  those who fled. <b> with all his wings</b>  Heb.  אגפיו  with all their wings, i.e., with all their strength they will  fall by the sword. <b> will disperse</b>  Seront repandus, will be scattered.  <b> 22</b>  <b> And I Myself will take</b>  And I will take the King Messiah. <b> and I will place [it]</b>  As the Targum  renders: and I will establish him. <b> a tender one</b>  It is customary to graft only from the tender [sprigs]  that grew the previous year, called grayfe in Old French, a shoot, graft. <b> and lofty</b>  Heb.  ותלול , from  the word mound,  תל , for a mound is usually high and lofty; amonceler in French, to heap up.  <b> 23</b>  <b> shall they dwell</b>  Heb.  תשכנה . The dagesh in the nun serves instead of a second nun, as  though it were written  תשכננה .  <b> 24</b>  <b> I...have lowered the high tree</b>  The nations that were ruling over Israel. <b> tree</b>  Zedekiah and his seed. <b> and have made the dry tree blossom</b>  Jehoiachin, who was exiled without  children, will beget Zerubbabel in Babylon, and he will be the governor of Judea, [appointed] to rule.   <b> Chapter 18</b>  <b> 1</b>   And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  <b> 2</b>  <b> What do you mean that you use this parable</b>  Asanplanz in Old French, comparison, parable. <b> fathers have eaten sour grapes</b>  Heb.  בוסר , fruit before it has ripened. Verjus inFrench, verjuice. <b> the childrens teeth are set on edge</b>  Heb.  תקהינה , agazeront in Old French, will be set on edge. So is  the way of the Holy One, blessed be He: the fathers sin and the children are punished, for the kings of  Israel sinned for many years before they were exiled, and we too need not be concerned that we shall  be punished for our iniquities.  <b> 3</b>  <b> shall no longer use this parable</b>  Heb.  משל , like  למשל  [the infinitive].  <b> 4</b>  <b> Behold, all souls are Mine</b>  So why should the son who did not sin against Me suffer?

Yet at the end of this Book (36:37): He says: I  will...be inquired of by the house of Israel. This is one of the places that teach us that the Holy One,  blessed be He, recants on evil. And regarding matters similar to this, it is said (Num. 23:19): He says  but He does not do. Midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma (Vayera 13).  <b> 4</b>  <b> Will you contend with them</b>  Heb.  התישפט , an expression of contending.  <b> 5</b>  <b> On the day I chose Israel</b>  This hatred was pent up before the Omnipresent close to nine hundred  yearsfrom [the days] that they were in Egypt until [those of] Ezekielbut His love had shielded them.  Now that they had increased their transgressions, though, it was awakened, and concerning this it is  stated (Prov. 10:12): Hatred arouses quarrels [but love covers up all transgressions].  <b> 7</b>  <b> And I said to them</b>  Aaron proclaimed this prophecy to them before the Holy One, blessed be He,  revealed Himself to Moses in the thorn bush.

Hence the statutes that are not good. <b> in order that I lay them desolate</b>  Heb.  אשמם . I shall lay them  desolate and destroy them.  אשמם , is an expression of  שממה , desolation.

Ezekiel called it the wilderness of the peoples because many nations  bordered upon it.  <b> 37</b>  <b> under the rod</b>  That you shall be subordinate to Me and to My chastisement. <b> of the covenant</b>  The covenant that I transmitted to you.  <b> 38</b>  <b> And I shall separate</b>  Heb.  וברותי , an expression of  ברד  [selecting, separating]. <b> their sojournings</b>  From the land of their exile I shall take them and slay them in the wilderness.  <b> 39</b>  <b> go worship</b>  and do not show the nations that you are called by My Name by coming to the prophet  to inquire of him [about the] Torah, and, after he tells you My words, not hearkening to Me, as the  matter that is stated (33:32): And behold you are to them like the song of the flutes, etc. They hear  your words, but they do not carry them out. <b> with your gifts and with your idols</b>  For you separate the  first born to be designated as a firstborn as I commanded you, but once My Name is called upon the  thing, you sacrifice them to idols.  <b> 40</b>  <b> and the first of your food</b>  Heb.  משאותיכם , like  משארותיכם  your kneading troughs, an expression of  food, like (Exod. 21:10): her food  (שארה) , her clothing, or her conjugal rights shall not be  diminished. Menachem also (p. 168) associated it in this manner.  <b> 43</b>  <b> and you will quarrel</b>  Heb.  ונקטתם , an expression of quarreling  (קטטה) . Another explanation,  following the Targum:  ותידנקון , and so does Jonathan render (9:4)  הנאנחים : and those who  groan, demonir in Old French, to melt away.   <b> Chapter 21</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> southward</b>  The land of Israel is south of Babylon. <b> to the forest of the field in the south</b>  To My  Temple, which is destined to be like a forest and like a field, to be plowed in order to be overrun by  foxes.  <b> 3</b>  <b> shall be scorched</b>  Heb.  ונצרבו , an expression related to (Lev. 13:23): a scar  (צרבת)  from the  boil; (Prov. 16:27), and on his lips is a kind of searing  (צרבת)  fire, an expression of a burn. <b> from the south to the north</b>  All the people south of Babylon, which is to the north.  ונצרבו , shall be  scorched, comes from  צרב  (as Lev. 13:2), retrere in Old French, to shrivel up.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Is he not an inventor of parables</b>  when I prophesy to them in language of parable and riddle, such  as a forest and a fire consuming [trees] moist and dry.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying</b>  Prophesy to them a clear prophecy. What I said to  you, Set your face southward, I explain to you: Set your face toward Jerusalem.  <b> 7</b>  <b> and prophesy</b>  Heb.  והטף , and prophesy. Similarly (Micah 2:6): Preach  (תטיפו)  not; (Amos 7:  16), and do not prophesy  (תטיף)  concerning the house of Isaac. <b> about the sanctuaries</b>  That is the  forest of the field. Sanctuaries denotes the two destructions.  <b> 8</b>  <b> righteous and wicked</b>  That is the moist and the dry.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Since I cut off from you</b>  and I knew that the nations would rejoice at your misfortune, I shall be  wroth with them and incite Nebuchadnezzar against all of them, and that is what I wrote, and all  faces from the south will be scorched.  <b> 14</b>  <b> A sword, a sword</b>  Two swords: the sword of the king of Babylon first, and afterwards the sword of  the children of Ammon in the hand of Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, who will slay Gedaliah and those  gathered to him of the survivors of the sword, as is delineated in Jeremiah (41:1-10). <b> furbished</b>  Heb.  מרוטה , forbide in Old French, furbished, polished. Menachem (p. 120), however, associated it as an  expression of drawing. Likewise (verse 16): and He gave it to draw  (למרטה) , and so all of them.  <b> 15</b>  <b> that it may glitter</b>  Heb.  ברק , to have a glitter, a shine, flandours, a flash, flashing (as in Deut 32:  41). <b> Shall we rejoice?</b>  This is a rhetorical question. Do we have anything more to be happy about? <b> The rod for My son disdains every stick</b>  The rod with which I strike My son to chastise him is the  hardest of all rods, and it disdains the blow of every staff and every stick, for they are like nothing to  it.  <b> 16</b>  <b> Then he had it</b>  the rod. <b> furbished to grasp in the hand</b>  To furbish it so that it be easy and fit to  grasp with the hand. <b> that is the sword that was sharpened</b>  That is the rod; it is a sharp and furbished  sword, to give it into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar to slay with it.  <b> 17</b>  <b> and wail</b>  Heb.  והילל , a term for wailing  (יללה) . <b> for it</b>  The sword will be upon My people and  upon their princes and officers. <b> those gathered to the sword</b>  Heb.  מגורי , a gathering of nations  coming to the sword were around My people. So did Jonathan render  מגורי , related to the word in  (Prov. 10:5): An intelligent son gathers  (אוגר)  in the summer; (ibid. 6:8), She gathers  (אגרה)  her food  in the harvest; (Joel 1:17), garners  (ממגרות)  are demolished; (Haggai 2:19), The seed is still in the  granary  (במגורה) .  Menachem, however, connected it to the word for fear, like (Num. 22:3): And  Moab became terrified  (ויגר) . <b> therefore, clap upon your thigh</b>  as a wailing and a lament.  <b> 18</b>  <b> For a test</b>  For a great test, with torments in many other forms of retribution, they were tested: the  rod, pestilence, famine, and wild beasts. <b> not be</b>  And what more will be on My son if also this disdainful rod comes upon him with the rest of  the test? <b> He will not be</b>  My son will no longer be in the world. Jonathan also rendered it they will not  exist, but the rest of the verse he did not render in this [i.e., Rashis] way, but so it appears to me. I  heard many explanations for it, and I saw [others] in books of interpretations, but they did not appear  correct to me, and the payat who composed for Chanukah [for the morning of the first  Sabbath]: That which disdained all wood stabbed the adulterer, supports me, for he called the  sword that which disdained all wood. Jonathan rendered in this manner: (verse 15)  או נשיש .  because the tribe of the house of Judah and Benjamin rejoiced at the tribes of Israel when they were  exiled for worshipping idols, and they returned to stray after wooden images. He, too, explains  או  נשיש  as a rhetorical question. <b> For a test</b>  and what if also a rod that disdains He will not be  [Jonathan renders:] For the prophets prophesied about them but they did not repent. That is to say,  the matter is already determined that they will not repent. And what will be their end? <b> disdainful rod? He will not be</b>  He [Jonathan] says: And also the tribes of the house of Judah and  Benjamin will be exiled, and with their evil deeds, they not [continue to] exist. The kingdom of the  tribe that disdained its fellow and scorned them and the evil that befell themshe too will not be and will  not endure. I shall further interpret it in another manner: <b> Or shall we rejoice, etc.</b>  Or perhaps we  should rejoice, for you say to Me that the tribe of My son disdains all wood: The kings of Judah  disdain idolatry, as we find with Abijah, who said (II Chron. 13:8): and with you are the golden  calves, and Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah, who abolished all the idolatry in the world that  was under their control, and these [the remaining tribes] too will repent. <b> Cry and wail</b>  and do not  rejoice over this, for it will be upon My people. And why? <b> Because it is tested</b>  The matter is already  tested and determined before Me that they will not repent properly. <b> wood, it will not be</b>  And what if I wait longer? Even if they came to repent and to disdain idolatry, the  matter would not last with them because they would hasten to revert to their wickedness. That is what  is said in Jeremiah (8:4): if he repents, will he not return?  <b> 19</b>  <b> prophesy and clap your hands one upon the other</b>  in the manner of those who lament, and  what is the prophecy? <b> and a third sword shall be doubled</b>  I said, A sword, a sword;  Nebuchadnezzars sword to destroy Jerusalem and the sword of the children of Ammon upon  Gedaliah. There is yet a third sword, doubled as much as these two, and it shall be a sword of the  slain; that is the sword of the great slaughter, which causes many slain to fall. <b> them</b>  Wherever you go out, it will pursue you into the innermost chambers. Behold, Johanan the son  of Kareah and the generals of the armies will go to Egypt; there the sword will overtake them, and so  in all the place from which they will flee, to the fortified cities, as it is stated in this piece: by all  your cities I gave the scream of the sword.  <b> 20</b>  <b> In order to melt</b>  Heb.  למוג , an expression of moving. Another explanation: an expression of  something melting. <b> and to increase the stumbling blocks</b>  Heb.  והרבה , and to increase the stumbling  blocks, and so every  הרבה  in Scripture is an expression of increasing, an infinitive. <b> sword</b>  Heb.  אבחת . Some interpret [this as]  טבחת , the slaughter of, the teth in place of the aleph, by the  code of  א"ט ב"ח  [whereby aleph is interchangeable with teth, beth with cheth, etc.] [This appears  to be Jonathans interpretation.] Others interpret it as  אבעת  an expression of  בעתה  [fright], but this  cannot be because the tav in  אבחת  is not part of the radical, and it comes only for the construct state,  whereas the tav in  בעתה  is a radical. Therefore, I say that  אבחתחרב  means the sounding of the voice of  those slain by the sword, an expression of barking  (נביחה)  glapissement in French, yelping, for  the nun in  נביחה  is a defective radical, like the nun in  נשיכה  biting, and the aleph comes in its  place, like (Job 13:17): and...my speech  (אחותי)  in your ears; (II Kings 4:2), except a jug  (אסוך)  of  oil. Menachem (p. 12) explained it as fear of the sword. It has no counterpart, but is interpreted  according to the context. <b> Woe, it is made to glitter</b>  Alas and alack! For it is made into a furbished and  polished blade. <b> enwrapped for the slaughter</b>  And enwrapped in a cloth until it would be grasped in  the hand for slaughter on the day of war. Some interpret  מעטה  as a form of the word for diminishing  (מעוט) , for it diminishes when they sharpen it, but it is an error that they have made, for the absence  of the vav and the dagesh in the teth indicate about it that the mem is not a radical, [but,] like  the mem of  מענה , afflicted,  מעטה , enwrapped, and (Songs 5:14)  מעלפת , overlaid with  sapphires. Menachem (p. 132) associated it as an expression of thought, like (Dan. 2:14): answered  with counsel  (עטא)  and discretion. Dunash, however, interprets it (p. 78) like (Ps. 104:2): [You]  enwrap  (עטה)  Yourself with light like a garment.  <b> 21</b>  <b> Get yourself to one side</b>  To one place, either to the right or to the left. <b> directed</b>  Heb.  מעדות ,  prepared.  <b> 22</b>  <b> I, too, shall clap My hands</b>  I say to you, Clap your hands one upon the other, and I, too, like  you, lament over them, and I shall clap My hands one upon the other, but My fury burns within  Me, and I shall give it rest.  <b> 24</b>  <b> make for yourself two roads</b>  as He concludes the [next] verse. <b> the road to the city</b>  Clear for yourself a place at the head of the road you are on, and make for  yourself a sort of road opening into the crossroads, one facing right and one facing left. <b> will emanate</b>  The two roads. <b> and clear a place</b>  A place cleared of the thorns and the thistles; [ ברא  is  like] essarter in French, to clear. A word similar to it appears in the Book of Joshua (17:15): then go  up to the forest, and clear it  (ובראת)  for yourself there. Again (ibid. verse 18): But the mountain shall  be yours, for it is a forest, and you shall cut it down  (ובראתו) . Menachem connected them all (p. 48) as  an expression of choosing, like (I Sam. 17:8): Choose  (ברו)  for yourselves a man;  ברא  meaning  lisant in Old French, choosing, appointing.  <b> 25</b>  <b> You shall make a road for the coming, etc.</b>  These two roads symbolize the king of Babylon, who  is leaving his country with the intention of going either to Jerusalem or to Rabbah of the children of  Ammon. To whichever of the two of them the lot will fall for him by his divinations, he will march, as  is delineated (verse 26): For the king of Babylon stood, etc.  <b> 26</b>  <b> the crossroads</b>  Heb.  אם הדרך , carrefour in French, crossroads. <b> he furbished the arrows</b>  Heb.  קלקל , he furbished the arrows with a glitter. He shot an arrow upward, and it turns by itself right  or left, and to the place it turnsthat is the lot. <b> he flashed with the arrows</b>  Menachem (p. 155),  connected it with (above 1:7): burnished  (קלל)  copper; (Ecc. 10:10): and he did not sharpen  (קלקל)  the edge. It may also be explained as an expression of deterioration, as in (Jer. 4:24): and  all the hills deteriorated  (התקלקלו) . Some translate  קלקל  into French, as trait, he shot, and Jonathan  as well renders  קלקל בחצים  as  קשתבגרריא . <b> he inquired of the teraphim</b>  An image that talks through  magic, and there is a set time, that if one makes it at that time, it possesses speech forever. <b> the liver</b>  There are some experts who divine with liver.  <b> 27</b>  <b> At his right was the divination to Jerusalem</b>  All his lots gave divinistic indication to come to  Jerusalem. <b> to appoint officers</b>  Heb.  כרים , appointed officers, heads of troops. <b> the gates</b>  You and your troop, take position by such-and-such a gate. <b> to pour a siege mound</b>  They  pour earth and tread it down and pile up a high mound and press it down, in a fashion similar to the  way they press down the mound of the towers, to stand on it and to wage war against the people of the  city.  <b> 28</b>  <b> And it was to them</b>  To Israelwhat Nebuchadnezzar did. <b> like a false divination</b>  and they will not  believe that he would succeed, but indeed, they had seven sevens. Nebuchadnezzar divined forty-nine  times, and all the divinations coincided exactly. <b> that they be seized</b>  And Nebuchadnezzar, in his divinations, would cause the iniquities that Israel  committed to be remembered, for Ammon and Moab, their neighbors, would make them known to him  because they would hear the reproofs of the prophets. <b> in order that they be seized</b>  [lit. to be seized.]  That Israel be seized in his hand.  <b> 29</b>  <b> Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered</b>  For you commit new transgressions  daily, and your earlier iniquities are remembered through them. <b> revealed</b>  [i.e.,] the new ones. <b> so that your sins appear</b>  [i.e.,] the old ones. <b> remembered</b>  before Me for evil, therefore... <b> you shall be seized in the hand</b>  You shall be delivered  into the hand of the king of Babylon.  <b> 30</b>  <b> wicked man, sentenced to be slain</b>  Liable to be slain for your wickedness. <b> prince of Israel </b> Zedekiah. <b> at the time of the final iniquity</b>  At the time the measure has become filled and the final  iniquity, which fills the measure, has arrived.  <b> 31</b>  <b> I shall remove the turban and lift off the crown, etc.</b>  This is to be explained as the Targum  renders: I shall remove the turban from Seraiah the High Priest, and I shall abolish the crown from  King Zedekiah. He said: Neither this nor that will remain in its place. <b> the humble will be uplifted </b> Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to whom it did not belong, will take it, and Zedekiah, to whom it did  belongit will be taken from him.  <b> 32</b>  <b> A ruin, a ruin</b>  Heb.  עוה , an expression of (Micah 1:6): a heap  (עי)  in the field, an expression of  ruin after ruin, two and three times, I shall make it: It was already taken from Jeconiah and given to  Zedekiah, and from Zedekiah it will be given to Gedaliah; this makes twice. Menachem (p. 131)  connected  עוה  with (Esther 1:16): has Vashti the queen done wrong  (עותה)  ?; (Ps. 106:5), we have  committed iniquity  (העוינו)  and wickedness. <b> this too will not be</b>  Also, to Gedaliah it will not  remain, [only] until Ishmael the son of Nethaniah [the assassin] comes. <b> judgment</b>  Upon whom I placed [the mission] to exact My vengeance and My judgment. <b> deliver him</b>  into his hands.  <b> 33</b>  <b> concerning the children of Ammon and concerning their blasphemy,</b>  [in] that they rejoiced  when Nebuchadnezzars lot in his divinations fell out to come upon Jerusalem, and they blasphemed  Me and My people, saying that their deity was triumphant. <b> to consume</b>  Heb.  להכיל , to cause many  slain to fall. <b> in order to glitter</b>  In order that its shiny appearance should not be darkened by its slain  ones.  <b> 34</b>  <b> When you prophesy vanity for yourself</b>  The diviners of Ammon prophesied vanity for  themselves, saying, Nothing more will come upon us. <b> the wicked</b>  To mislead you and to place your neck like the necks of the slain of the wicked of Israel. <b> whose day has come, etc.</b>  Heb.  יומם , their day.  <b> 35</b>  <b> It has been returned</b>  Heb.  השב , like  שבה , it has returned, because the shin has no dagesh. [The  missing dagesh indicates that no letter is missing; hence, the root is  שוב , return, rather than  ישב , sit  or dwell.] Wait until the sword that is upon Israel returns into its sheath, and afterward, when he has  finished His revenge upon Israel, He will return upon you, and in the place you were created, etc.  <b> 36</b>  <b> I shall blow upon you</b>  Heb.  אפיח , an expression for blowing fire with a bellows. <b> brutish men</b>  Who  behave madly to ruin and to destroy. <b> craftsmen of destruction</b>  Artisans of murder. (Already many  days [have passed] since I explained this chapter as it is written above. Now I see from the  peculiarities of its wording that the prophet is talking only about the sword.) To place you upon the  necks of the slain of the wicked, It has been returned to its sheath, etc. I shall blow upon  you. This wording is appropriate only for metal, and so craftsmen of destruction. It seems to me  that this prophecy was stated about Nebuchadnezzar, and so it appears [from]: prophesy and say: So  said the Lord God concerning the children of Ammon and concerning their taunts. That is to say,  [their taunts] over Nebuchadnezzar [because of Nebuchadnezzar], for the children of Ammon were  taunting Israel because Nebuchadnezzar destroyed them. [33] <b> Sword, drawn sword</b>  The sword of  Nebuchadnezzar, which is double, to go out on the two waysagainst Jerusalem and against the children  of Ammon, as is delineated in the above chapterthus the retribution on the children of Ammon. [34] <b> When you prophesy for yourself, when you divine lies for yourself</b>  You think that through your  divinations of vanity, futility, and lies, you will prosper, for your sword is placed upon the necks of the  slain of the wicked, whose day has come by decree from before Me at the time of the payment at the  time of their end. [35] <b> It has been returned to its sheath</b>  That is to say, the time will come that the  sword will return to its sheath, and the sword will receive its own retribution, at the hands of the kings  of Media, and then I shall blow upon you with the fire of My wrath, and you shall be delivered into the  hands of mad blacksmiths, who are craftsmen of destruction, who will come to sharpen and to furbish  it as of yore, and they will destroy you.   <b> Chapter 22</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> will you judge the city of bloodshed</b>  Jerusalem. <b> and let her know</b>  The heh in  והודעתה  is  pointed, so that the meaning is, and let her know.  <b> 3</b>  <b> O city that sheds blood in her midst, her time is approaching</b>  This is a transposed verse, and this  is its meaning: A city that sheds blood in her midst the Lord God said that its time is coming. <b> makes idols</b>  Like and which makes idols, etc.  <b> 4</b>  <b> up to your years</b>  The decree of (Deut. 4:25): and you will have grown old, with its numerical  value, which Moses said. <b> and [a subject of] gossip</b>  Heb.  וקלסה , gossip, that everyone will speak  about you, parlediz in Old French, [subject of] gossip.  <b> 5</b>  <b> will gossip about you</b>  And what is the gossip?... <b> whose name is so befouled</b>  This is she who  befouled her name, for they were called a holy people, sons of their Creator, and they caused  themselves to be called (Isa. 6:5) a people of unclean lips.  <b> 6</b>  <b> each one by his own arm</b>  Whoever was stronger overpowered [the other].  <b> 7</b>  <b> Father and mother are held light in you</b>  All the abominations in the section of (Lev. 19, 20) You  shall be holy, about which they were warned, are enumerated here.  <b> 8</b>  <b> My holy things have you despised</b>  And not as I said (Lev. 22:29): you shall slaughter it as an  expression of your good will.  <b> 9</b>  <b> and in you they have eaten upon the mountains</b>  and on the mountains they have worshipped in  you to pagan deities. <b> they have held wicked plans</b>  Heb.  זמה , plans of wickedness.  <b> 12</b>  <b> and enriched your neighbors with dishonest gain</b>  You made your friends rich with the dishonest  gain that you gained dishonestly from the poor. Another explanation:  ותבצעי  is a form of a word for  robbery, like (Ps. 10:3): and the robber  (ובצע)  blesses himself for having blasphemed the  Lord. Accordingly, its interpretation is: and you robbed your friends with affliction.  <b> 13</b>  <b> I clapped My hands together</b>  I cried out, Woe! and lamentation. <b> over your dishonest gain </b> Here we learn that robbery is more severe than all of them, for their verdict was sealed because of it.  <b> 14</b>  <b> that I will deal with you</b>  That I will deal with you according to your deeds.  <b> 15</b>  <b> and I will make...completely disappear</b>  And I will end.  <b> 16</b>  <b> And you shall be profaned within yourself</b>  Heb.  ונחלת בך , you shall be profaned within  yourself for what you have done.  <b> 18</b>  <b> dross</b>  A mixture of dross mixed in silver and gold, and it is necessary to smelt it in fire to refine it. <b> furnace</b>  in which gold is refined.  <b> 20</b>  <b> As they gather silver</b>  As the silversmith gathers all the dross into the furnace. <b> to blow</b>  Heb.  לפחת ,  to blow  (לנפח) . <b> to melt</b>  Heb.  להנתיך . (Exod. 25:12) and cast  (ויצקת)   is translated into Aramaic  as  ותתיך .  <b> 24</b>  <b> it was not rained upon on the day of fury</b>  The rain fit to cleanse it on the day of fury was not  given it, and the explanation of the matter is as the Targum paraphrases: Good deeds were not  performed in her which would protect her on the day of curse.  <b> 25</b>  <b> There is a conspiracy of her prophets</b>  Heb.  קשר  [lit. a knot]. They are joined together in an evil  counsel. <b> they devoured souls</b>  For they would take bribes and strengthen the hands of evildoers to kill  and plunder and rob, and then they would prophesy peace for them. <b> riches</b>  Heb.  חסן , money.  <b> 26</b>  <b> robbed My Torah</b>  It was incumbent upon them to reprove, to instruct, and to make known  statutes and ordinances, but they did not do so. This is robbery, for they robbed it from those who  needed to learn. <b> and I was profaned in their midst</b>  Heb.  ואחל , and I was profaned.  <b> 27</b>  <b> for the sake of dishonest gain</b>  To seize money.  <b> 28</b>  <b> plastered for them with daub</b>  They are like those who plaster a building with plaster that is not  completely processed, which has no straw; it dissolves by itself when rain falls on it. The expression  תפל  means anything that is lacking preparation.   <b> Chapter 23</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> two women</b>  Two states, which are like two women. <b> the daughters of one mother</b>  The two of them  were from one nation, separated into two in the days of Rehoboam.  <b> 3</b>  <b> There...were pressed</b>  [Heb.  מעכו ]. The Egyptians [pressed] their bosoms, an expression of (Lev.  22:24): and anything that has been crushed  (ומעוך) . <b> and there they squeezed</b>  The Egyptians  [squeezed] their virgin breasts; i.e., they taught them the ways of their abominations. [Heb.  עשו ,]  eteyn[d]irent in Old French, they squeezed  <b> 4</b>  <b> And their names</b>  i.e., their nicknames were Oholah and Oholibah. <b> and their names</b>  The original  ones. Samaria is the one I nickname Oholah, for from the beginning she became a tent  (אהל)  for the  calves of Jeroboam and for Ahabs temple of Baal. Although Samaria was not built until the days of  Omri, He calls the kings of Israel by its name, because as soon as it was built, it became the capital. <b> Oholibah</b>  Because My tent  (אהלי)  was in her  (בה) , and My sanctuary.  <b> 5</b>  <b> and she lusted</b>  [Heb.  ותעגב ,] and she lusted, esvayer or eswaier in Old French, to covet, to lust  after. Some editions read: desirer, to desire. <b> for the Assyrians, who were nearby</b>  Who were her  neighbors, and they sent to them [requesting that they] aid them. This is Menachem the son of Gadi (II  Kings 15:19f.), who gave tribute to Pul king of Assyria in order that his hands might be with him to  strengthen the kingdom in his hand. The prophet likens the matter to an adulterous woman, for, had  they worshipped the Holy One, blessed be He, they would not have needed the kings of Assyria.  <b> 7</b>  <b> And she bestowed her harlotries upon them</b>  Her adulterous heart and her promiscuous spirit she  bestowed upon them, for she desired them. <b> and in all that she lusted</b>  In all the nations with whom she  collaborated, she learned their ways and became defiled with their idols.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And her harlotries from Egypt she did not abandon</b>  They relied also upon the kings of Egypt, for  we find (II Kings 17:4), concerning Hoshea the son of Elah, that he sent messengers to So the king of  Egypt. <b> for they had lain with her, etc.</b>  And since then, they poured out their harlotry upon her -  her promiscuous spirit entered her from the days of her youth.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Therefore, I delivered her, etc.</b>  For Sennacherib came and exiled them.  <b> 10</b>  <b> and she became a name for the women</b>  to take from them a curse for any adulteress to learn a  lesson from her: See what happened to so and so because of her lewdness. <b> and... judgments</b>  [Heb.  ושפוטים ,] like  שפטים , judgments, justises, jostises in Old French, judgments, punishments.  <b> 11</b>  <b> And her sister Oholibah saw</b>  all the evil that befell her sister because of her harlotries, but she  was unafraid. <b> she became... corrupt in her lust</b>  [Heb.  עגבתה ,] her lust, wai(y)ter in Old French,  unbridled passion.  <b> 12</b>  <b> For the sons of Assyria she lusted</b>  This is Ahaz, who sent to the king of Assyria for aid (II Kings  16:7).  <b> 14</b>  <b> And she increased her harlotries</b>  to lust for images that she had not seen [in actuality], only their  likeness, engraved on the wall with types of drawings, whereas her sister did not do anything like this. <b> images of Chaldeans</b>  The likeness of Chaldean men, who were unusual in their attire. <b> drawings</b>  [Heb.  בששר ,] types of drawings.  <b> 15</b>  <b> Girded with girdles</b>  This was the way of the Chaldeans attire. <b> hanging turbans</b>  [Heb.  סרוחי  טבולים .] [ סרוחי  means] oversized, large hats. Menachem (p. 97) explains [ טבולים ] like (Gen. 37:  31) and dipped  (ויטבלו)  the shirt in the blood. Thus the interpretation of  סרוחי טבולים  is as  follows (Exod. 26:12): The overhanging  (וסרח)  length of the dyed turban. There is no [other  occurrence of a word] similar to  טבולים , and its meaning is derived from the context, and so did  Jonathan render: helmets placed on their heads]. <b> mighty men</b>  [Heb.  שלישים ,] mighty men.  <b> 16</b>  <b> at the sight [that reached] her eyes</b>  Because she saw the likeness of their form.  <b> 17</b>  <b> And the children of Babylon came to her for a bed of love</b>  They made a covenant together, and I  say that this is said concerning Hezekiah, who rejoiced about the emissaries of Merodach-baladan (Isa.  39, II Kings 20), and he fed them at his table and showed them his entire treasure house. This  resembles the prophets statement (verse 14), men engraved on the wall, because they came from a  distant land, and the Chaldeans were not frequent visitors to them, as it is said (Isa. 39:3): They have  come to me from a distant country, and from seeing their faces once, they became endeared to him.  And the Holy One, blessed be He, became wroth with him because of this matter, as it is written (Isa.  36:6, II Kings 20:17): Behold a time will come when everything in your palace...will be carried off,  etc., and in (II) Chronicles (32:25): But Hezekiah did not pay back according to the benefit they had  done for him, but his heart became haughty; therefore, wrath came upon him and upon Judah,  etc. <b> her soul was disgusted with them</b>  [Heb.  ותקע .] That Jehoiakim and Zedekiah rebelled against  them.  ותקע  is esloched in Old French, dislocated.  ותקע  is like (Gen. 32: 26): and the upper joint of  Jacobs thigh was dislocated  (ותקע) .  הוקעה  is an expression of joining and inserting a pole into the  earth, and also when it is withdrawn from the earth, is the expression  קעיה  appropriate for it, just as  you say (Ps. 80:10): it took root  (ותשרש) , as an expression of taking root, and (Job 31:12), and it  uproots  (תשרש)  all my grain, as an expression of uprooting. Similarly (Isa. 17:6): on its branches  (בסעפיה)  when it produces fruit, is an expression of branches, and (ibid. 10:33), lops off  (מסעף)  the branches, is an expression of cutting off the branches of the tree and its boughs.  <b> 19</b>  <b> to remember the days of her youth</b>  The desire for the Egyptians rose in her heart, for Zedekiah  sent to them, as it is said (above 17:15): But he rebelled against him by sending to Egypt.  <b> 20</b>  <b> And she lusted for their concubinage</b>  [Heb.  פלגשיהם ,] for their concubinage, to be a concubine  to them. <b> those whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys</b>  [i.e.,] the phallus. <b> and...is the issue of horses</b>  An  expression of a profusion of sexual intercourse, for they engage in sexual intercourse more than any  other male animals.  זרמת  refers to the stream of semen, like (Habakkuk 3:10): A stream  (זרם)  of water  passed.  <b> 21</b>  <b> And you remembered</b>  [Heb.  ותפקדי ,] and you remembered. <b> were squeezed</b>  [Heb.  בעשות ,] an  expression of pressing.  <b> 22</b>  <b> your lovers</b>  The Chaldeans, who pleased Hezekiah. <b> disgusted</b>  Whom Zedekiah [in a change of heart] subsequently hated and against whom he rebelled.  <b> 23</b>  <b> Pekod, Shoa, and Koa</b>  Jonathan rendered [these as] the names of states, and Scripture supports  him in the Book of Jeremiah (50:21): Upon the rebellious land, march upon her, and upon the  inhabitants of Pekod. [But] the Commentators say that they are an expression of appointees, princes,  and rulers. <b> and summoned ones</b>  Somonz, semonz in Old French, summoned (top people).  <b> 24</b>  <b> weapons</b>  [Heb.  הצן ]. Dunash (p. 59) explained it as one type of weapon, but I say that it is an  expression of the surroundings of camps like (Num. 33:55): and camps  (ולצנינים)  in your  sides, [which Onkelos renders:] and camps surrounding you. Menachem (p. 150) explains  הצן  like  (Ps. 91:4): His truth is an encompassing shield  (צנה וסחרה) , but Dunash does not agree with him, and  the Targum supports Dunash, rendering: they will come upon you with weapons.  הצן  is like  בהצן ,  with weapons, and  הצן  could mean the same as  חצן , from (Isa. 49:22): and they shall bring your sons  בחצן ,which means with the arm, and so too: And they will come upon you  הצן , meaning [as with]  an army, as (Dan. 11:15), and the arms  (וזרועות)  of the south, meaning the armies of the south. <b> I shall place judgment before them</b>  What is incumbent upon Me to judge. I will make them My  agents to execute the judgment. <b> with their judgments</b>  A judgment that I did not write in My Torah,  but which is one of the judgments of their customs, and what is it? Blinding the eyes, that they blinded  Zedekiahs eyes.  <b> 25</b>  <b> your nose and your ears</b>  They are the beauty of the countenance, and to them he compared the  priesthood and the kingship. <b> and your survivors</b>  The rest of the people. <b> consumed by fire</b>  And the best of your land, which is the security upon which to rely for a livelihood.  <b> 26</b>  <b> of your garments</b>  The priestly raiment.  <b> 28</b>  <b> those you hate</b>  The Chaldeans, against whom you rebelled.  <b> 30</b>  <b> These will be done</b>  [Heb.  עשה ,] an expression of continuous action, faisant in French, doing  (gerundive).  <b> 32</b>  <b> too much to bear</b>  Too much to contain, like to bear.  <b> 33</b>  <b> and bewilderment</b>  [Heb.  ושממה ] bewilderment.  <b> 34</b>  <b> and drain</b>  [Heb.  ומצת ,] an expression of sucking to the last drop, et tu suceras in French, and you  will suck. <b> and its shards</b>  He compares the cup that gives Israel the drink of retribution to an  earthenware vessel, which, once broken, can no longer be repaired. So will it be that once their  salvation comes and the cup breaks, He will not return to give them any more to drink. When He  speaks of giving drink to the nations, however, He calls it gold, as it is said (Jer. 51:7): Babylon is a  golden cup in the Lords hand, it intoxicates all the earth. <b> you shall scrape</b>  [Heb.  תגרמי ,] like (Num.  24:8): and he scrapes  (יגרם)  their bones; (Zeph. 3:3), they did not leave over the bones  (גרמו)  for  morning, ronger in French, to gnaw. He scrapes with his teeth around the bone or the shard to detach  from it the meat adhering to it. Menachem (p. 59) connects it to an expression of breaking, and he  interprets: and he breaks their bones, and they did not break the bones for morning, in like  manner.  <b> 35</b>  <b> bear your lewdness</b>  Accept the liabilities of the counsel of your sins.  <b> 36</b>  <b> will you judge</b>  [Heb.  התשפט ,] an expression of debate.  <b> 37</b>  <b> and blood is on their hands</b>  Through their adulteries, they shed blood. <b> have committed adultery</b>  Their adultery was with their idols. <b> and also their children, etc.</b>  And this  is the bloodshed that is on their hands (i.e., they masturbated with their hands and they did not repent).  <b> 38</b>  <b> they defiled My sanctuary on that day</b>  On the day they slaughter their children for idolatry, they  come before Me in My sanctuary to commit abominations therein, to provoke Me. <b> My Sabbaths</b>  For they would slaughter their children on the Sabbath.  <b> 40</b>  <b> And furthermore, that they would send</b>  [Heb.  ואף כי .] And surely, worst of all is that they would  send to bring to them [invite] some of the princes of the nations, their lovers, and these see the  profanation with which they profane My sanctuary. <b> to whom an emissary is sent, etc.</b>  from Oholah  and Oholibah to come to them. <b> and behold they came to the place where you bathed, daubed, etc. </b> [Heb.  לאשר ,] to which. Jonathan renders:  לאתר , to the place, au lieu in Modern French. To the place that  you designated for them, saying, In such and such a place, we will come out to meet you, beautified  by the bathing and the daubing. <b> daubed</b>  [Heb.  כחלת ,] a kind of dye named  כחול , with which they  color their eyes, ecler in Old French, to brighten.  <b> 41</b>  <b> a stately bed</b>  Adorned with all kinds of beautiful bedclothes, parede in Old French, adorned  lavishly.  <b> 42</b>  <b> And the sound of a multitude</b>  of many nanons were in her; not a multitude that came for war, but  the voice of a tranquil multitude. <b> for the sake of men</b>  [Heb.  ואל אנשים ,] for the sake of men. That  multitude was of men, not of animals. <b> of the many people</b>  who were in her midst, who were brought  to commit adultery, from the desert. <b> those dwelling all around</b>  [Heb.  סבאים ,] people who lived  around her. Of her neighbors, Ammon and Moab, and so did [Jonathan] render  סבאים  from all  around. <b> they placed</b>  Oholah and Oholibah [placed] bracelets on their hands to adorn themselves in  order to commit adultery; i.e., Ammon and Moab, since they are many, she adorns and beautifies  herself for them, and because they are her neighbors, she beautifies herself before their eyes with her  ornaments; therefore, Oholah and Oholibah put bracelets on their hands in order to be beautiful in the  eyes of the adulterers. The vav of  ויתנו  is superfluous, like that of (Exod. 15:2): The strength  and the cutting of God was  (ויהי)  my salvation, and like that of (ibid. 9:21): But whoever did not  take the word of the Lord to heart left  (ויעזב) .  <b> 43</b>  <b> And I said of the one who had aged [in] adulteries, Now her harlotries will end, etc.</b>  I said to  Myself about this one who had become worn out and aged in her adulteries, From now on, since she  has aged, her harlotries will leave her, and the desires for her harlotry will leave her heart, and she will  repent, but she is still in her harlotries as in the beginning. <b> will end</b>  [Heb.  יזנו ] will leave.  Every harlot  (זונה)  is translated into Aramaic as  נפקתברא , one who goes out. So did I hear, and so  did Jonathan render. <b> of the one who had aged [in] adulteries</b>  like: [lit. to the one who had aged  adulteries,] the one who had aged in adulteries, as you say (Gen. 38:11): and she remained her  fathers house, is like in her fathers house; (Exod. 30:20), they shall wash water, is like they  shall wash with water. [Likewise,] (ibid.): And he shall go out freedom; [and] (Num. 30:11): But  if she made a vow [in] her fathers house. So did Dunash (p. 17) explain [this]. However, Menachem  connected it (p. 45) to (Lev 20:12): they committed a disgraceful act  (תבל) , but his words are  impossible.  <b> 44</b>  <b> And he came to her</b>  whoever so desired <b> the lewd women</b>  [Heb.  אשתהזמה ,] [like]  נשי הזמה ,  women of lewdness.  <b> 45</b>  <b> And righteous men</b>  Judges, the princes of the king of Babylon and the king of Assyria. But  Jonathan renders: righteous, as compared to them. According to the deeds of these harlots, the nations  are more righteous than they. <b> the judgment of adulteresses, etc.</b>  as is delineated further.  <b> 46</b>  <b> Let...be brought up...and let them be submitted</b>  All these are expressions of doing and of a  continuous action.  <b> 47</b>  <b> shall pelt them with stone</b>  The slaying of their sons and daughters and the burning of their houses  is the judgment of adulteresses. <b> and slash them with their swords</b>  That is the judgment of  murderesses. [The word]  וברא  is an expression of cutting, and so: and you shall cut it down  (ובראתו)  , of the forest shall be yours in the Book of Joshua (17:18).  <b> 49</b>  <b> And they shall put their lewdness upon you</b>  Your judges shall put the judgment of your lewdness  on your heads.   <b> Chapter 24</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> in the ninth year</b>  of Zedekiah.  <b> 2</b>  <b> the king of Babylon has besieged</b>  Today he besieged it.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Set the pot</b>  [Heb.  שפת , set.] On the mouth of the stove on the place where it is set. That is called  שפיתה  in Mishnaic Hebrew, for our Rabbis said (Shab. 38b): [A stove has] a place for the setting  of  ]שפיתת[ two pots. We learned also (Beizah 34a): If one sets the pot, one puts in water, and one  puts in the condiments... We learn that is the placing it on the mouth of the stove before they put  anything into it. This figure represents Jerusalem, about which you said, It is the pot. Now the time  has come for it to become a pot, and you will become the meat inside it, and Nebuchadnezzar is  coming and will put in on the fire. Menachem (p. 179) explained it as an expression of placing. <b> also pour water into it</b>  These [represent] the accessories for the siege.  יצק  is like  שפך , pour.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Gather its pieces to it</b>  Out of fear of the siege, gather into it all its leaders and its princes. <b> good piece</b>  Every mighty, awesome hero and every warrior.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Take the choice of the flocks</b>  You, Nebuchadnezzar, take the choicest of your armies around it. So  did Jonathan render, but this does not fit with the idea of the pot. This must therefore be interpreted to  mean that the choicest of Israel will come and enter into its midst. <b> it</b>  [Heb.  דור ,] an expression of arranging, and so (Isa. 22:18): He shall wind you around like a turban,  like a surrounding wall  (כדור) , a row of surrounding troops. A row  (דורה)  is translated into Aramaic  as  דרא . However, Menachem explains it (p. 67) as (verse 9): Even I shall enlarge the fire  (המדורה)  . <b> make it boil well</b>  After they all are inside it, the siegeworks and the armaments will come near the  city.  <b> 6</b>  <b> and its filth</b>  Its filth, which they remove from its surface by boiling it, is called escume in Old  French, foam, ecume in Modern French. This means: the wicked within her have not come out. <b> by limb</b>  Exile after exile, who went out and defected to the Chaldeans, every man by himself. <b> has fallen on it</b>  Not like other pots, whose pieces they take out all at once in order to place before  each one his portion and his lot. Jonathan renders: because they did not repent within it. [Therefore,]  the lot of the Omnipresent did not fall on it.  <b> 7</b>  <b> smooth</b>  [Heb.  צחיח ,] smoothness. <b> she did not pour it out on the ground, etc.</b>  Jonathan  paraphrased: with willful wickedness and with an arm raised on high did she shed it; she did not shed it  unintentionally to repent of it. Our Rabbis (Git. 57b, Pesikta dRav Kahana 122a) explained it as  referring to the blood of Zechariah the son of Jehoiada. They did not treat it as the blood of the deer or  the blood of the gazelle.  <b> 8</b>  <b> So that it might bring up fury</b>  before Me. I [therefore (Etz Chaim ms.)] commanded that blood not  to be absorbed into the ground, in order that it might be remembered, so that My vengeance might be  taken.  <b> 9</b>  <b> the fire</b>  [Heb.  המדורה ,] a great kindling, foaie in Old French, a pyre.  <b> 10</b>  <b> pile on the wood, kindle the fire</b>  And to pile on the wood, to kindle the fire, and to consume the  meat. <b> and prepare the mixture</b>  When the meat is consumed off the bones and it shrivels and  becomes mingled with the liquid, and one stirs it with a spoon, it resembles a mixture of a  compounding of spices, which they mix very thoroughly; and through the shriveling of the meat, its  smoke is turned back into it, which is called aorser in Old French, to burn. And this is what [the  following verse] says: <b> and the bones will be scorched</b>  [Heb.  יחרו .] They will be cooked and smoked,  an expression of (Job 30:30): dried out  (חרה)  from the heat. Similarly (verse 11), in order that it be  heated, that its base be scorched  (וחרה) , as happens with a pot whose water has evaporated through  its boiling: it heats up, its shards burn, and the cooked food spoils.  <b> 11</b>  <b> its filth shall be consumed</b>  [Heb.  תתם .] Its filth will end and be absorbed into its base.  סיר  is [a  pot] made of copper.  <b> 12</b>  <b> With guile she wearied</b>  [Heb.  תאנים הלאת .] With pretext and guile, she wearied the poor.  Therefore, the wicked in her midst will not leave her, but they will perish in the fire of her retribution.  <b> 13</b>  <b> With your defilement</b>  With defilement of lewdness you will perish. <b> Since I purified you</b>  by  reproving you through the prophets, and you did not become purified, etc.  <b> 14</b>  <b> I shall not nullify</b>  [Heb.  לא אפרע .] I shall not nullify My decree. <b> nor shall I renege</b>  [Heb.  ולא אנחם ,]  to turn back from My plans of evil, which I said I would execute upon you.  <b> 16</b>  <b> the desire of your eyes</b>  Your wife, as the context proves at the end [of the episode].  <b> 17</b>  <b> Melt</b>  [Heb.  האנק ,] melt in silence, soliles demoniz in Old French, to melt. <b> your glory</b>  Tefillin. All  these commandments are for mourners, but you shall do the opposite. A mourner is forbidden to wear  tefillin or shoes, he is required to wrap his head, and they serve him the first meal from food belonging  to others.  <b> 18</b>  <b> as I had been commanded</b>  not to observe mourning.  <b> 19</b>  <b> what these mean to us</b>  What are these signs to us?  <b> 21</b>  <b> whom you have left over</b>  in Jerusalem, when you went out into exile.  <b> 22</b>  <b> And you shall do as I have done</b>  You shall not observe mourning because you have no consolers,  for no one among you is not a mourner, and there is no mourning except where there are consolers.  Another explanation: For you will be afraid to weep before the Chaldeans in whose midst you are. <b> upper lip</b>  [Heb.  שפם ,] grenon in Old French, moustache.  <b> 23</b>  <b> and you will melt</b>  [Heb.  ונמקתם ,] esere(y)z demoniz, and you will collapse.  <b> 24</b>  <b> when it comes</b>  When this evil comes.  <b> 25</b>  <b> the pride of their soul</b>  [Heb.  משא נפשם .] Their soul is uplifted through them.  <b> 26</b>  <b> On that day</b>  It is impossible for the fugitive to come on the day of the destruction. Therefore this is  the meaning: On that day, [on the day] that the fugitive will come to you to let you hear with your own  ears, on that day, your mouth will be opened. <b> to let you hear with your own ears</b>  To announce the  news that the city has been struck.  <b> 27</b>  <b> with the fugitive</b>  [Heb.  אתהפלים ,] with the fugitive. <b> and you will speak and no longer be mute </b> Because I said to you (3:26): and you shall become mute, and you shall not be, etc. From now on,  they will see that your words are true, and you will no longer be mute from prophesying to them.   <b> Chapter 25</b>  <b> 3</b>  <b> Aha!</b>  An expression of joy. <b> because it was possessed</b>  [Heb.  נחל .] Because it was possessed  (ננחל)  and became an inheritance for others.  <b> 4</b>  <b> to the children of the East</b>  The Chaldeans and Aram are to the east.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Because you clapped with your hand and stamped with your foot</b>  for joy. Although he said this at  the beginning of the Book in reference to mourning (6:11): Strike with your hand and stamp with  your foot, and say, Ah! there are things that are done for [both] mourning and joy, but the idea  behind them is not the same. Similarly, flutes for a bride and for the dead. <b> and stamped</b>  [Heb.  ורקעך  ,] an expression of stamping. <b> with all the disdain</b>  [Heb.  שאטך ,] interpreted as an expression of disdain,  like (Gen. 25:34): and Esau despised, which Onkelos renders:  ושט , but I say that  שאטך  is an  expression of lust, golozemant or golosement in Old French, ardent desire, gluttony.  <b> 8</b>  <b> Behold the house of Judah is like all the nations</b>  The love of the Holy One, blessed be He, has  been annulled from them, and they are rejected, to be given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar like the  other nations. The Midrash Aggadah (see Lam. Rabbah, Proem 9) [says] that they entered the Temple  and peeled off the pictures of the cherubim that Solomon had painted on the wall of the Temple (I  Kings 7:36): according to the attachment of a man and the joining, etc. They took them outside and  said, Look at what these [Jews], who were showing themselves as decent people, were occupied  with.  <b> 9</b>  <b> behold I will expose</b>  the fortresses of the land of Moab that are on the border at the end of their  boundary; that is the flank, the end of the boundary of their land, like (Exod. 27:15): And on the  other side, to the flank, which Targum [Jonathan] translates  לעיברא , to the side.  <b> 10</b>  <b> To the children of the East</b>  I will expose them so that they should come upon the children of  Ammon through the land of Moab.  <b> 13</b>  <b> and Dedan</b>  [Heb.  ודדנה ,] the inhabitants of Dedan.  <b> 14</b>  <b> by the hand of My people Israel</b>  They will be My agents to wreak My vengeance.  <b> 15</b>  <b> Because the Philistines acted with vengeance</b>  With hatred and with rigor, like a man who wreaks  vengeance upon his enemy.  <b> 16</b>  <b> the Cherethites</b>  [Heb.  כרתים ,] a nation deserving of being cut off (Targum). But I say, because I  saw elsewhere that Scripture calls the Philistines  כרתים  (Zeph. 2:5): Woe to the inhabitants of the  seacoast, the nation of  (כרתים) , and it does not give any other nation this appellation, it appears to me  that there is a region of Philistia called Chereth, and so I find in the Book of (I) Samuel (30:14),  concerning the group that set fire to Ziklag: We made a raid on the south of the Cherethites. <b> seacoast</b>  [Heb.  חוף הים ,] marche in Old French, frontier, borderland. They are Philistines, who live in  the southwestern corner of the land of Israel on the Western (Mediterranean) Sea.   <b> Chapter 26</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> in the eleventh [year]</b>  of Zedekiah.  <b> 2</b>  <b> Jerusalem</b>  which was under siege. <b> Aha!</b>  [Heb.  האח ,] an expression of a shout of joy. <b> the peoples have been broken</b>  A city through which all the nations enter for commerce will now be  broken, for the siege will not leave it until it is taken. <b> it has turned to me</b>  From now on, the  merchandise of the nations has turned on me. <b> I shall become full from the destroyed [city]</b>  I shall  become full from the destroyed city of Jerusalem.  <b> 4</b>  <b> and I shall remove</b>  [Heb.  וסחיתי ,] and I shall uproot, like (Prov. 15:25): The Lord will uproot  (יסח)  the house of the haughty; (Deut. 28:63); and you will be uprooted  (ונסחתם)  from... <b> a smooth rock </b> Since it was built on a rock in the midst of the sea, when it will be demolished and its earth will be  uprooted into the sea, the rock will be left bare, and so did Jonathan render: a smooth, bare rock.  <b> 5</b>  <b> a place to spread out nets</b>  On the rock the fishermen will spread out their fishing nets, to dry them.  <b> 6</b>  <b> And her daughters that are in the field</b>  the villages that are subservient to her, surrounding her.  <b> 8</b>  <b> and will station against you shields</b>  [Heb.  צנה ,] and will station against you those armed with  shields.  <b> 9</b>  <b> And...his catapult</b>  [Heb.  ומחי קבלו .] This is one of the devices of the siege, to throw huge rocks  and to strike opposite it, e la hone de sa pereyre in Old French, and the striking of his stone-throwing  machine.

This is called  שפעת , an abundance.  Similarly, (Job 22:11): or an abundance of  (ושפעת)  water covers you, de la foison in French, of  abundance. <b> as men enter a breached city</b>  as they enter a city that has been breached of its  wall(Targum), that its wall has been breached.  <b> 12</b>  <b> your merchandise</b>  [as translated], your merchandise.  <b> 16</b>  <b> and they will tremble for [fear of] destruction</b>  [Heb.  לרגעים ,] for fear of destruction, lest it  befall them like your destruction.  לרגעים  as is an expression of breaking, like (Isa. 51:15): Who  splits  (רוגע)  the sea; (Job 7:5), my skin split  (רגע) ; (Ps. 35:20), and against the crushed people of  (רגעי)  the earth, [synonymous with]  דכאי  the crushed people of the earth. Menachem, however,  explained it (p. 162) in the sense of  רגע , a moment, as in (Ps. 30:6): For His wrath lasts but a moment  (רגע) . <b> and will be appalled</b>  [Heb.  ושממו ,] an expression of bewilderment.  <b> 17</b>  <b> established from the seas</b>  [Heb.  מימים .] Some vocalize it without a dagesh  (מימים)  and  interpret it to mean settled from days of yore, and others punctuate it with a dagesh  (מימים)  and  interpret it to mean settled with strength through the seas surrounding her, and so it is. <b> terror</b>  around to all the inhabitants. Heb.  חתיתם , lur defre[n]emant in Old French, their terror.  <b> 18</b>  <b> the isles</b>  [Heb.  האין ,] like  האיים . <b> by your departure</b>  by your departure into exile.  <b> 19</b>  <b> when [I] bring up the deep upon you</b>  When I bring upon you companies of nations as numerous  as the waters of the deep, and many nations will cover you. Jonathan translated it in this manner, but  according to its apparent meaning, first it was given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, and ultimately,  the sea came up and inundated it.  <b> 20</b>  <b> with those who descend into the Pit</b>  with those who descend into Gehinnom. <b> to a people of old </b> with the other nations who are there from long ago. <b> like the ruins of old</b>  like the cities that were  destroyed from times of yore, viz. Sodom and her sister cities. <b> land of the living</b>  And I shall bestow beauty upon Jerusalem.  <b> 21</b>  <b> a nonentity</b>  [Heb.  בלהות .] Jonathan explained  בלהות  [as] as if you did not exist, and the exegetes  explain it as a word for a place where the satyrs and demons dance.   <b> Chapter 27</b>  <b> 3</b>  <b> on the seaport</b>  [Heb.  מבואתים , lit. by the entrance of the sea.] By the port where the ships come up  to the wall and the gates. Many large cities are situated by the sea, but they are not a [good] place for  a port, and the ships cannot approach them.  מבואתים  is port in Old French, seaport. <b> peoples</b>  So was their custom: the merchants who came there this one from the north, that one from the  south were not allowed to conduct commerce with one another. Rather, the inhabitants of the city  would purchase from this one and sell to that one. <b> you said, I am the perfection of beauty</b>  Until now,  all [were] saying about Jerusalem (Lam. 2:15): the perfection of beauty; (ibid.) the joy of all the  earth. Now you boast, saying, I am the perfection of beauty, the ultimate extreme of beauty is  incorporated in me.  <b> 4</b>  <b> your builders</b>  [Heb.  בניך ,] your architects, from the word  בנין , building.  <b> 5</b>  <b> junipers from Senir</b>  Since it was built on the sea and was destroyed by the sea, the prophet  compares it to a superior ship whose cargo in its hold was too heavy for it, and which sank by the east  wind. <b> all the planks</b>  the planks from which the ship was made. <b> cedars from Lebanon</b>  the name of the  forest where the cedars are prevalent. <b> a mast</b>  [Heb.  תרן .] This is the tall, upright pole that is thrust into  the ship, upon which they hang the sail, which is called voile in French. Also, there are holes at its top,  through which is drawn the rope by which they pull the ship. [Pole is] mast in Old French.  <b> 6</b>  <b> oaks</b>  [Heb.  אלונים ,] a kind of tree that does not produce fruit, chesne in Old French. <b> your oars </b> [Heb.  משוטים .] They are the boards that are wide at the end, with which they guide the ship, rames in  French. <b> your rudder</b>  [Heb.  קרשך , lit. your board.] This is the wide board at the second end of the ship,  opposite the mast at the other end, with which they steer the ship in all directions and direct it on its  course, and the captain holds it. In the language of the Mishnah (B. B. 91a)  קברניט , and in French  gouvernail, rudder. <b> they made of ivory inlaid in cypresses</b>  [Heb.  שן בת-אשרים .] It is impossible for it to  be of anything but wood, and this is  בתאשרים , as if it were one word, an expression of (Isa 41:19): firs  and cypresses  (ותאשור) . Both of them, Jonathan rendered  אשכרוען . He compares the rudder of Tyre to  a rudder of cypress inlaid with ivory [and] with nails for beauty and strength, for so did Jonathan  render: boards of cypresses inlaid with ivory,  ביתחופאה לאתיטרון , so that its cover should not fall.  However, Jonathan explained this rudder as applying to the city, concerning the boards of its gates.  <b> 7</b>  <b> Linen with embroidery</b>  linen cloth made with pictures and embroideries. <b> your sail</b>  [Heb.  מפרשך ,]  that which is called voile in French, a sail. <b> to be to you for a staff</b>  to spread it on the pole of cedar and  to raise it on the mast.  נס  is in the language of the Mishnah  כלונס , and in French perche, pole, rod. <b> was your covering</b>  as a tent and a roof over the entire surface of the ship.  <b> 8</b>  <b> were your oarsmen</b>  [Heb.  שטים ,] those who hold your oars to guide you. <b> your mariners</b>  those who  hold the rudder to direct and straighten the ship.  <b> 9</b>  <b> The elders of Gebal</b>  [who were] skillful builders, as it is said (I Kings 5:32): and Hirams builders  and the Gebalites. <b> who repaired your cracks</b>  [Heb.  מחזיקי , lit. strengthen,] repaired your cracks so  that no water should enter them, apiye[ce] tans ta crevaze in Old French, repairing your crack. <b> ships of the sea and their mariners</b>  [Heb.  ומלחיהם ,] their sailors. <b> were within you</b>  They were  around you to sail to the distant countries to bring the merchandise into your midst. <b> necessities</b>  [Heb.  לערב מערבך ,] an expression of guaranteeing. These are all a persons necessities, by  which he lives; and his money is his guarantee and his salvation for his lifetime, garantie in French.  <b> 11</b>  <b> The children of Arvad and your army</b>  [Heb.  וחילך ,] the rest of the army of people who dwell  within you. <b> and Gammadim</b>  Jonathan rendered: and also Cappadocians. I heard in the name of Rabbi  Menachem that because they dive into the sea as far as the deep and estimate  (גמדי)  the cubits of its  depth, they are called Gammadim. Others explain that they are dwarfs and fit into the measure of a  cubit. <b> their quivers</b>  [Heb.  שלטיהם ,] These are the quivers in which they would put arrows, like (Jer.  51:11): Polish the arrows, fill the quivers  (השלטים) , cuyvrin[e] in Old French, quivers. <b> they heaped </b> [Heb.  תלו ,] many heaps upon heaps  (תלי תלים) .  <b> 12</b>  <b> Tarshish</b>  a sea named Tarshish. <b> with the multitude of all wealth</b>  that was in your midst. The  merchants were confident that they would find in you the merchandise fit for them. <b> your aid</b>  [Heb.  עזבוניך ,] your strength and your aid, like (Neh. 3:8): and they strengthened Jerusalem to the...  wall, and a persons money is his strength. which sets him up on his feet.  <b> 13</b>  <b> with living people</b>  male and female slaves to sell.  <b> 15</b>  <b> your place</b>  [Heb.  ידך , lit. your hand,] your place. <b> horns, ivory, and peacocks</b>  horns of ibexes,  bones of elephants, and peacocks, birds called paon in French. <b> brought you as a gift</b>  [Heb.  השיבו  אשכרך ,] brought your gift.  <b> 16</b>  <b> Aram was your merchant</b>  [dealing] with the precious stones mentioned in the verse, and purple  cloth, embroidery, and fine linen. <b> because of the multitude of your works</b>  because they knew that  your princes and dignitaries accumulate many works of beauty and glory for [use as] ornaments <b> carbuncle</b>  [Heb.  שנפך ,] e c(h)arbuncle in Old French.  <b> 17</b>  <b> with wheat of Minnith</b>  the name of a place that produced wheat of high quality, like (Jud. 11:  33): until you come to Minnith. Midrash Aggadah (source unknown) [explains it as] good, thick  wheat kernels, which are sold by number. Jonathan renders:  בחטי ריחוש  expression for a gathering of  many numbers, troche in Old French, bundle, bunch. A similar word appears in Pesikta [dRav  Kahana, p. 184b]: Just as the myrtle is crowded  (רחוש)  with leaves, so was Leah crowded with  sons. But I do not know what it [wheat of Minnith] is. In the name of Rabbi Simon, I heard that he  found in a Bible with a Jerusalem Targum  בחטי מניתופנג  rendered:  בחושלא וקלמא . Now,  שערי דחושלא ,  which is found in the Talmud (Yoma 79a), is explained as: peeled barley. I say, however,  that Minnith is an expression of portions  (מנות) , prepared food. Even according to its vocalization  with a dagesh, Jonathan is wont to translate a word sometimes according to its apparent meaning  and sometimes according to its midrashic meaning. So did he render (below 39:16): And also the  name of the city shall be Hamonah  (המונה) . Although we punctuate the name  המונה  without  a mappiq hey  (המונה) , [with a mappiq hey (pronounced)  המונה  would mean her multitude with  a silent hey it means simply a multitude.] Jonathan paraphrases: And also there, the slain of the  city whose multitude is great will be cast. <b> balsam trees</b>  [Heb.  פנג .] I saw in the book of Joseph the  priest (Josiphon vol. 1 p.155 ch. 36 Flusser): The balsam tree is pannag, and they were found in  Jericho, and because of the fragrant scent, it [the city] is called Jericho [ יריחו  from  ריח , scent], balsme  in Old French.  <b> 18</b>  <b> with white wine</b>  [Heb.  ביין חלבון ,] cooked white wine, and Menachem (p. 89) connects it with  (Ps. 147:14): the best  (חלב)  of the wheat, an expression of goodness <b> and white wool</b>  [Heb.  צחר .]  [Jonathan renders:] fine white covered wool. On the day the lamb is born, and its mother cleanses it  by licking it, they make a cover and wrap it around it with clasps so that that its wool be clean.  צחר  means white, like (Jud. 5:10): white  (צרורות)  donkeys.  <b> 19</b>  <b> Vedan and Javan</b>  They are states. <b> spun silk</b>  [Heb.  מאוזל ,] spun silk thread. <b> ingots</b>  [Heb.  עשות ,] made like ingots  (עששיות)  mas(s)es or mas(s)iz in Old French, ingots, massive, and  that is iron of Cush.  <b> 20</b>  <b> in precious raiments for chariots</b>  [lit. in raiments of freedom for riding, translated according to  the Targum as] in precious raiments for chariots.  <b> 21</b>  <b> with lambs</b>  [Heb.  בכרים ,] lambs. Jonathan renders: with cattle, and so too did he render (II Kings  3:4): one hundred thousand bulls,  (כרים)  of Mesha, king of Moab.  <b> 23</b>  <b> Assyria and Media</b>  [Heb.  אשור כלמד .] Jonathan renders: the states of Assyria and Media.  <b> 24</b>  <b> with adornments</b>  [Heb.  במכללים ,] with things that are for adornment  (מכלול) , paramenz in Old  French, adornments, jewelry, and what are the adornments? Wraps of embroidered blue cloth. <b> with treasures kept in chests</b>  With beautiful adornments that are kept in chests called escrin in Old  French, (ecrin in modern French). They are covered with leather and decorated for beauty with sorts  of nails forming rows and pictures, and they are called  קמטריא  in Aramaic and  ברומים  in Hebrew, and  they are tied and bound with linen ropes for beauty. <b> and [enclosed in] myrtle wood</b>  Jonathan renders:  myrtle wood. Those chests were placed in chests of myrtle wood, and they would bring them into the  outer chests and the chest within them, and so too, the ornaments that were inside the chests;  everything all together for merchandising. This is the meaning of the wording in brief: and with  treasures [kept] in chests, tied with ropes and [enclosed in] cedar wood, for the  ברומים  are the chests,  and they were tied with ropes and placed in chests of myrtle, which is a species of cedar. And the  adornments that were inside the chests, Jonathan calls  וכושפין דארזא באימלין די זהריתא  adornments  that require good watching  (זהירות) , [i.e.,]  דמחתין בקומטרין  that were placed in chests. And the word  מגדל  in the Targum is like what we learn: a box and a chest  (מגדל)  schafreite in Middle High  German, clothes chest, cupboard. [In some editions] armaise in Old French.  <b> 25</b>  <b> Ships...your plains</b>  [Heb.  שרותיך .] They were to you as a plain and a flat terrain. Just as the flat  terrain is a paved road, upon which to bring merchandise to a city situated on dry land, the ships of  Tarshish were for you instead of them (sic) as a highway for bringing your merchandise into your  midst. <b> your plains</b>  [Heb.  שרותיך ,] an expression for Sharon and flat terrain. A similar instance is (Jer. 5:  10): Ascend upon its rows  בשרותיה . <b> and you were filled and you became very heavy</b>  They brought  a great burden into your midst and made your load too heavy.  <b> 26</b>  <b> In the abundant waters, your oarsmen brought you</b>  After the manner of the large ships, which  they send into the midst of the sea. And since you are filled and are too heavy, the east wind will come  and shatter you in the heart of the seas. As regar ds the comparison of the city: since you were filled  with wealth, your heart became haughty, and retribution will befall you.  <b> 28</b>  <b> the neighboring districts</b>  [Heb.  מגרשות ,] like (Num. 35:2): and open land  (ומגרש)  for the cities.  <b> 29</b>  <b> they will stand upon the land</b>  What use have we anymore with ships? Where shall we take our  wares from now on?  <b> 30</b>  <b> they will wallow</b>  [Heb.  יתפלשו ,] they will roll.  <b> 32</b>  <b> And they will lift up over you with their wailing</b>  [Heb.  בניהם ,] with their wailing. <b> Dummah</b>  [Heb.  כדמה .] This was the name of the heads of Edom, as the matter is stated (Isa. 21:  11): The harsh prophecy about Dumah  (דומה) . Jonathan renders: There is none like  (דמי)  as one of  her likeness  (כדומה) .  <b> 33</b>  <b> When your merchandise came out, etc.</b>  All this they will lament over you in their lamentation.  <b> 35</b>  <b> their faces were angry</b>  [Heb.  רעמו פנים ,] angry faces, and so (I Sam. 1:6): in order to make her  complain  (הרעימה) , and so every expression of complaint is called  תורעמתא .  <b> 36</b>  <b> hissed</b>  [Heb.  שרקו ,] sibler in old French, to whistle. So do people whistle about a thing that has  disappeared.   <b> Chapter 28</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> a seat of God</b>  he made for himself in the air, over the sea, with a mechanism that was a replica of  seven heavens, and he sat down on the highest one.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Behold, are you wiser than Daniel</b>  [As for] Daniel Nebuchadnezzar came to make him a god (Dan.  2:46): and prostrated himself before Daniel, and ordered that they should offer a meal offering and  sacrifices of sweet odors to him, but he did not accept it upon himself, yet you make yourself a God? <b> that no secret is hidden from you</b>  [Heb.  לא עממוך ,] is not hidden from you. These are taunts [by]  which he is taunting; that is to say: Perhaps you are as wise as Daniel, about whom it is stated: (Dan. 4:  6): and no secret overwhelms you?  <b> 4</b>  <b> did you acquire wealth for yourself</b>  [Heb.  עשית לך חיל . lit. did you make.] Did you acquire  property for yourself? <b> and gather gold and silver</b>  [Heb.  ותעש ,] and gather.  <b> 7</b>  <b> and they will draw their swords</b>  [This is to be understood] according to its apparent meaning.  [According to] Midrash Aggadah (see Mechilta to Exod. 15:9; Tan. Vaera 9), it means homosexuality,  for he was used sexually as women are. Three pretended to be gods and were sexually molested like  women: Joash the son of Ahaziah, as it is said (II Chron. 24:24): and upon Joash they exacted  judgment, Hiram, and Nebuchadnezzar. <b> your brightness</b>  [Heb.  יפעתך ,] your brightness, an  expression of the appearance of the countenance. The Medrash interprets it as the beauty of your  time  (יפה עתך) .  <b> 9</b>  <b> your slayer</b>  [Heb.  מחללך ,] like  הורגך .  <b> 12</b>  <b> images</b>  [Heb.  תכנית ,] peinture in French, painting, engraving. <b> images, etc.</b>  You are full of the wisdom to seal and to stamp every pattern and shape.  <b> 13</b>  <b> In Eden, the garden of God</b>  With much goodness and pleasure. You enjoy yourself as if you were  dwelling in Eden, the garden of God. All wealth, pride, and honor are given to you: all precious stones  are set on your raiment. <b> your covering</b>  Your canopy. Another explanation: Your raiment. <b> your drums and your orifices</b>  Although I gave you all this honor, I knew that you would become  haughty, and I made in you the work of the perforated drums that let out wind with an instrumental  sound like a drum, and these are what you should have contemplated about.  <b> 14</b>  <b> You are a cherub of great measure, that covers</b>  You are a bird of measure, i.e., the huge bird  that covers a large area with his wings; i.e., you rule over a large dominion.  ממשח  is a word for  largeness, like (Num. 13:32): men of stature  (אנשי מדות) . which is translated into Aramaic as  גברי  דמשחן . <b> and I gave that to you; you were on the mount of the sanctuary of God</b>  and I gave you a  place to acquire a name for yourself in the edifice of the mountain of My sanctuary, for you assisted  Solomon with the cedar wood. <b> you walked among stones of fire</b>  You acquired for yourself a  memorial with the kings of Israel, who are like the ministering angels.  <b> 15</b>  <b> until wrongdoing was found in you</b>  in your saying, I am a god.  <b> 16</b>  <b> they filled</b>  [Heb.  מלו , like  מלאו ,] they filled. <b> and I shall cast you as profane</b>  You caused me to  eradicate you, so that you shall no longer be remembered concerning the building of My House. <b> shall destroy you</b>  [Heb.  ואבדך ,] like  ואאבדך  and I shall destroy you. <b> from among the stones of fire </b> that you shall not take a share with the righteous. Our Rabbis in the Midrash Aggadah (B. B. 75a)  interpreted this section as referring to Adam: So said the prophet to Hiram, Why should you be proud  of your sky? Were you in the Garden of Eden, as Adam was? <b> [13] every precious stone, etc.</b>  For I  made all these canopies for Adam, and the least of them was gold, which is counted last. <b> your drums, etc.</b>  With this, I made you equal to him, but not with anything else, and I pondered over  you and created drums and orifices in Adam. <b> [14] Are you a cherub of great measure</b>  Are you like  that cherub that was great in measure, whose great wingspan covered from one end of heaven  completely to the other end of heaven, and did I place you to be on the holy mountains as I placed  him?  <b> 17</b>  <b> you destroyed your wisdom with your brightness</b>  for you were proud of your brightness. <b> upon you</b>  [Heb.  לראוה בך ] to gaze upon your shame;  לראוה  is like  לראיה , to see.  <b> 18</b>  <b> you profaned your sanctity</b>  [Heb.  מקדשך ,] your sanctity. <b> fire out of your midst</b>  Haughty words  that came out of your mouth, saying, I am a god. Another explanation: [It is to be interpreted]  according to the Targum: And I brought forth peoples as strong as fire because of your arrogant sins.  <b> 19</b>  <b> will wander</b>  [Heb.  שממו .] will wonder.  <b> 23</b>  <b> around</b>  Because they will see the sword surrounding [them] from outside, the people of the city will  assess [the situation] and be sure that they will be slain in her midst. [Heb.  ונפלל ,] like (Gen. 48:  11): I did not think  (פללתי) , and like (Deut. 32:31): and our enemies judge  (פלילים) . They will  judge themselves to be slain in her midst.  <b> 24</b>  <b> And there will no longer be to the house of Israel, etc.</b>  Since he prophesied about Ammon,  Moab, the Philistines, Edom, Tyre, and Zidon, who are the neighbors of the land of Israel, that they  would be destroyed. Since they all will be destroyed, there will not be a briar or a thorn to [the people  of Israel, in all their surroundings, to pain or harm them. <b> briars</b>  [Heb.  סילון ,] a species of thistles and  thorns. <b> pricking</b>  [Heb.  ממאיר ,] a matter of hurting, like (Lev. 13:51): painful  (ממארת)  zaarath, poignante in French, stinging, pricking. <b> who plunder them</b>  [Heb.  השאטים ,] who plunder  them.  <b> 25</b>  <b> to My servant, to Jacob</b>  As it was given to Jacob, an inheritance without boundaries (Gen. 28:  14): and you will spread out toward the west and the east, toward the north and the south.   <b> Chapter 29</b>  <b> 3</b>  <b> the great crocodile</b>  Since all the greatness of Egypt and all its plenty comes though the Nile River,  the prophet compares its king to a crocodile and its people to the fish of the river. <b> My river is my own </b> I do not need the heavenly powers, for my river provides all my necessities <b> and I made myself</b>  With  my might and with my wisdom, I enhanced my greatness and my dominion.  <b> 4</b>  <b> hooks</b>  [Heb.  חתים ,] type of iron rings, ens in Old French. <b> scales</b>  [Heb.  בקשקשתיך ,] en tes e(s)chardes in Old French, to your scales.

This is the perishing of fish: once they are spread out on the surface of the dry land,  they die.  <b> 6</b>  <b> a prop of reeds</b>  Many times they relied on them: in the days of Sennacherib and in the days of  Nebuchadnezzar, but it did not avail them, just like this reed, which is soft and does not support the  one who leans on it.  <b> 7</b>  <b> When they took hold of you with the hand</b>  [Heb.  בכפך , lit. with your hand,] to be read  בכף , with  the hand, like a man who walks and supports himself on his staff. <b> you splintered</b>  [Heb.  תרוף ] [like]  תרצף . <b> and pierced the whole of their shoulders</b>  [lit. the whole of a shoulder,] i.e., their shoulders,  like a man who leans on a reed, which breaks, and the man falls on it, and the shreds enter his  shoulders. <b> and you made their loins stand upright</b>  [Heb.  והעמדת .] Since you will break, they will be  required to strengthen their loins and stand on them. You are like a man upon whom his friend was  leaning, but he is weak and he says to him, Strengthen yourself on your loins, for you can no longer  lean on me. So did Jonathan render: and you will no longer be a support for them. Some transpose  והעמדת  to  והמעדת , and you make all loins totter, but I do not care for their words. Moreover,  Menachem (p. 134) associated it with the standing of the feet, just as I do.  <b> 11</b>  <b> neither shall it be inhabited for forty years</b>  Forty-two years of famine were decreed in Pharaohs  dream, corresponding to the three times the dream is written. He saw seven bad cows and seven bad  ears of grain (Gen. 41) and he told it to Joseph; hence we have [it mentioned] twice, and Joseph said  to him, The seven thin and bad cows and the seven empty ears, totaling forty-two for the famine.  But they had only two, as it is stated (ibid. 45:6): For it is two years now that the famine has been on  earth, and when Jacob came down to Egypt, the famine ceased, for behold in the third year they  sowed, as it is stated (ibid. 47:19): and then you give us seed that we may live etc., and the forty  years were paid to them now: neither shall it be inhabited for forty years.  תשב  means sera asijiee in  Old French. will be settled, peopled.  <b> 14</b>  <b> their habitation</b>  [Heb.  מכורתם ] [like]  מגורתם , their habitation. Another interpretation: like  תולדותם ,  their birth, and this is how Menachem (p. 110) associated it.  <b> 15</b>  <b> So that they shall not domineer over the nations</b>  [Heb.  רדות ,] an expression of ruling, like (Gen.  1:28): and rule  (ורדו)  over the fish of the sea.  <b> 16</b>  <b> And it will no longer be </b> [i.e.,] Egypt [will no longer be] a source of confidence for the House of  Israel, bringing iniquity into remembrance for them, since the Holy One, blessed be he, said to them  (Exod. 14:13): You shall no longer continue to see them.  <b> 17</b>  <b> And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year</b>  of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. That year Egypt  was delivered into his hand. This is what we learned in Seder Olam (ch. 26). In this book, there are  many prophecies written in a non chronological order.  <b> 18</b>  <b> made his army serve [a great work against Tyre]</b>  [Heb.  צור אל , usually to here means] against  Tyre, [in] a great work. <b> every head</b>  the men of his forces <b> became bald and every shoulder, etc.</b>  As is  the custom with those who besiege a city many days and toil and weary themselves with carrying  burdens of wood and stones. He captured Tyre in the twenty third [year] of his reign, as we find in  Seder Olam (ad loc.).  מקרח  means calvo in Italian, bald. <b> sore</b>  [Heb.  מרוטה ,] pelee in Old French,  peeled. <b> yet he had no reward</b>  After they had plundered its booty, the sea rose and washed it away  from them, because it was decreed on it and on its booty to be lost in the sea.  <b> 20</b>  <b> For his labor that he undertook against it</b>  [As] reward for the labor that he undertook against  Tyre by My command, I shall give him the land of Egypt. <b> because of what they did to Me</b>  [Because  of] the evil that Egypt [did to Me] with their prop, that they assured My people with their futile aid.  <b> 21</b>  <b> On that day will I cause the horn of the House of Israel to blossom out</b>  I have neither heard nor  found the explanation of this verse. What is the blossoming of the horn of Israel in the downfall of  Egypt? Was not Israel exiled eight years before the downfall of Egypt? [Therefore,] I say that On that  day refers back to the above section, (verse 13): At the end of forty years, I will gather the  Egyptians. That count ends in the year that Belshazzar assumed the throne, and we find in Daniel that  in that year the kings of Persia began to gain strength, and downfall was decreed upon Babylon, as it is  said (Dan. 7:1): In the first year of Belshazzar,...Daniel saw a dream, etc.; (verse 4) The first one  was like a lion - that is Babylon. And it is written (ad loc.): I saw until its wings were plucked off,  etc. (verse 5) And behold another, second beast, resembling a bear that is Persia. And it is written (ad  loc.) And thus it was said to it, Devour much flesh. i.e., seize the kingdom. And the kingdom of  Persia was the blossoming of the horn of Israel, as it is said regarding Cyrus (Isa. 45:13): He shall  build My city and free My exiles. Now, how do we know that the forty years of Egypt ended at that  time? [The proof is that] Egypt was given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the twenty-seventh  [year] of Nebuchadnezzar, in the year that this prophecy was said to Ezekiel. Add forty years, and you  have sixty-seven. Deduct from them forty-five for Nebuchadnezzar and twenty-three for Evil-  Merodach, as we say in Megillah (11b), one of these years counting for both [kings], as we say  there: they were incomplete years. <b> and I will give you free speech in their midst</b>  You, Ezekiel,  will have free speech when they see your prophecy being fulfilled.   <b> Chapter 30</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> Ha!</b>  Like Aha! Ha! to the day that is destined to come upon those nations.  <b> 3</b>  <b> the time of the nations</b>  The time of the destruction of the nations.  <b> 4</b>  <b> and there will be quaking in Cush</b>  [Heb.  חלחלה ,] expression of trembling. When they hear of  Egypts downfall, they will fear for their lives: perhaps the king of Babylon will rise up against them.  <b> 5</b>  <b> and all who support her</b>  [Heb.  וכל הערב .]Jonathan renders:  וכל סומכותא , all those who guarantee the  security of Egypt, garantie in French, guarantee. <b> [and the people of] the allied land</b>  Those who made  a treaty with Egypt to aid her.  <b> 8</b>  <b> when I have set a fire</b>  My fury, which is like fire.  <b> 9</b>  <b> emissaries...from before Me</b>  Troops of armies going on My mission in many caravans to frighten  Cush, which is dwelling securely. <b> With legions</b>  [Heb.  בצים ,] like (Num. 24:24): And legions  (וצים)  from the place of the Kittites, and so too did Jonathan render it: with legions.  <b> 12</b>  <b> And I shall make the rivers</b>  the land of the rivers; that is, Egypt. <b> and I shall sell</b>  as the Targum  renders: and I shall deliver.  <b> 14</b>  <b> and I shall execute punishments in No</b>  [This is] Alexandria.  <b> 16</b>  <b> to split</b>  Her wall will split. <b> adversaries [will attack her] daily</b>  [Heb.  צרי יומם , lit. adversaries of  days.] Adversaries will come upon her every day.  <b> 17</b>  <b> and they will go into captivity</b>  both of them, the provinces of Aven and Pi beseth.  <b> 18</b>  <b> the day will withdraw itself</b>  [Heb.  חשך היום ,] the light will be withheld <b> a cloud will cover her </b> Trouble will come upon her and cover her, and it will become dark [for her] like a day covered with  clouds.  <b> 21</b>  <b> I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt</b>  already another time, for I placed his army  in the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as it is said in the Book of Jeremiah  (46:2): Concerning Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco, the king of Egypt, which was on  the Euphrates in Carcemish, whom Nebuchadnezzar king smote, etc. <b> and behold, it was not bound </b> from that day on, as it is said at the end of the Book of Kings (II 24:7): And the king of Egypt no  longer went out of his land, for the king of Babylonia had taken from the river of Egypt, and with this  expression Jeremiah, too, prophesied concerning that blow, using the language it has no cure, as it is  said (Jer. 46:11): Go up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt; in vain you have  increased medicines, you have no cure.  חבשה  is an expression of binding, for they bind the broken  bone.  to place a bandage [Heb.  חתול ,] [a dressing] made of cloth and plaster, like (above 16:  44): nor swaddled at all  (והחתל לא חתלת) . <b> to grasp a sword</b>  that he should have more strength to  wage war.  <b> 22</b>  <b> and I shall break his arms</b>  I shall break the second [arm], and both of them will be broken; i.e.,  the king of Babylon took from one side; I shall yet give him the entire kingdom.  <b> 24</b>  <b> And I shall strengthen</b>  [Heb.  וחזקתי ,] an expression of strength.  <b> 25</b>  <b> And I shall grasp</b>  [Heb.  והחזקתי ,] an expression of grasping, that one grasps his hand to support  it so that it should not fall. The end of it proves it: and the arms of Pharaoh will fall, because He  does not hold them.   <b> Chapter 31</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> Whom are you like in your greatness</b>  In your haughtiness against Me, whom did you think to  resemble?  <b> 3</b>  <b> Behold Assyria</b>  which I have already cast down. <b> a cedar in Lebanon</b>  it was <b> shady woods</b>  A forest  that covers, [making] a great shade. <b> and among the interwoven branches</b>  the green trees. <b> tops</b>  [Heb.  צמרתו ,] cime in French, top.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Water nurtured it; the deep made it grow tall</b>  [Jonathan paraphrases:] Among nations he is great;  because of his supporters he is powerful; he subjugates kings under his kingdom, and he appoints  rulers over every state of the earth. The Midrash Aggadah (Pesikta Rabbathi 34:11, Meir Ayin 33)  [states]: and among the interwoven branches was its lofty top. Whence did he merit greatness?  Because 1) he withdrew from the counsel of the generation of separation, as it is said (Gen. 10:  11): Out of that land Asshur went forth. When all those who came upon the world formed one  league to enter counsel to rebel against Him, then his lofty top was visible by itself, and [he] did not  link himself with them. Water nurtured him; the [waters of the] deep raised him up and because 2)  he hearkened to the voice of Jonah the son of Amittai, who descended into the [waters of the] deep,  and the people of Nineveh repented of the violence that was in their hands. <b> its canals</b>  [Heb.  תעלתיה ,]  fosses in French, ditches, canals. <b> to all the trees of the field</b>  to water them.

We, then, who have been commanded with many commandments, should surely  have the land given to us for an inheritance (Tosefta Sotah 6:7). This is what the prophet answers  them.  <b> 25</b>  <b> You eat on the blood, etc., and you should inherit the land</b>  This is a rhetorical question.

Therefore, they will pass by them and bury them. Menachem (p. 91)  interprets it in his book (Machbereth) to mean that they will close their nose so as not to smell the odor  of the corpses.  <b> 13</b>  <b> They will bury all the people of the land</b>  because they died there. <b> and they will be renowned </b> All the nations will speak their name as praise and as a sign of kindness: There are no nations as  compassionate as this one; do you find a man who buries his enemy who rose up against him to kill  him?  <b> 14</b>  <b> Men of continuous employment</b>  Men designed to continuously devote themselves to this.

Those who crossed the ocean will bury them  for their own benefit. <b> with those who pass through</b>  Heb.  אתהעברים , with those who pass through. So I  heard, and so did Jonathan render. <b> those who are left on the surface of the land</b>  far from the  crossing. Those who cross the sea will not occupy themselves with burying them. Those designated to  devote themselves to this purpose will bury them. <b> at the end of seven months</b>  the majority of the  corpses visible to the eye will have been buried; from then on they will probe through the land in the  hidden places, in the briars and among the thorns, and bury whomever find.  <b> 15</b>  <b> And when they that pass through the land shall pass</b>  Wayfarers who see a human bone will  construct a marker next to it as a sign that there is a bone of a dead body there, in order that wayfarers  and those who prepare ritually pure food should stay away from it. <b> until</b>  the men of continuous  employment, designated to search, will come and bury it.  <b> 16</b>  <b> And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah</b>  And also the city whose name is the city  stirring with numerous people, that is, the wicked city, the masses of its inhabitants will be buried  there. <b> Thus they shall purify the land</b>  [i.e.,] Israel will purify their ritually pure foods and their  terumoth in the Land. <b> Hamonah</b>  without a mappiq hey since the final hey serves as an adjective,  for  המונה  is like  הומיה , stirring.  <b> 18</b>  <b> rams, lambs, he-goats, and bulls</b>  kings and dukes, rulers, and princes. <b> fatlings of Bashan</b>  [Heb.  מריאי בשן ,] An ox given to be fattened is called al meri in Arabic.  <b> 21</b>  <b> My judgment</b>  [Heb.  משפטי ,] My retribution, justize in Old French, judgment, punishment.  <b> 23</b>  <b> And the nations will know that for their iniquity they were exiled</b>  [i.e.,] the Children of Israel.  When they see My might, they will recognize that it was not because of inability that I did not save  them but because of their iniquity that I hid My face from them, and they were exiled.  <b> 25</b>  <b> and I shall be zealous for My Holy Name</b>  And I donned the zeal of salvation and vengeance for  the sake of My Holy Name, that it no longer be profaned. <b> and I shall be zealous for My Holy Name </b> [Heb.  לשם ,] for the sake of My Holy Name, as in (Num. 11:29): Are you jealous for my sake  (המקנא  אתה לי) .  <b> 26</b>  <b> And they shall bear their disgrace</b>  When I do good to them and I do not recompense them  according to their evil, they will bear the disgrace and be ashamed to lift up their faces. Menahem,  however, explained  ונשוי  like (Ps. 32:1): Praiseworthy is he whose transgression is forgiven  (נשוי) , an expression of atonement.  <b> 28</b>  <b> And I shall no longer leave</b>  one of them in exile.   <b> Chapter 40</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> on Rosh Hashanah, on the tenth of the month</b>  What year is it whose Rosh Hashanah falls on the  tenth of the month? The answer is that this is the Jubilee year. The Temple had been destroyed in  [3338] the thirty-sixth year of the [50-year] Jubilee [cycle] which had commenced in the eighteenth  year of Josiah [3303]. Fourteen years later [3352], the [beginning of the next] Jubilee would have  fallen, and this was the twenty-fifth year of the exile of Jeconiah, who had been exiled in [3327], the  twenty-sixth year of the Jubilee [cycle] [consisting of] fourteen years of Josiah, from the eighteenth to  the thirty-first year [3302-3316], and eleven years of Jehoiakim [3316-3327]. <b> the hand of the Lord </b> The strength of His might, to lead me against my will. <b> and He brought me there</b>  to the city that was  smitten - that is Jerusalem. That year He showed him the edifice of the future Temple.  <b> 2</b>  <b> In the visions of God He brought me</b>  He did not take me there but made it appear to me as if I  were there. <b> on a very lofty mountain</b>  For it is indeed destined to be lofty, as it is said (Isa. 2:2): and  it shall be raised above the hills. <b> like the building of a city</b>  [Heb.  כמבנה עיר .] <b> from the south</b>  at the  south of the mountain.  <b> 3</b>  <b> like...copper</b>  Like the shine of the Living Beings (above 1:7): and they sparkled like the color of  burnished copper. <b> with a linen cord in his hand</b>  For measuring land, there is nothing better than  linen cord. <b> and a measuring rod</b>  with which to measure the thickness of the wall and the length and  width of the gates.  <b> 4</b>  <b> to all that I am showing you</b>  the matter of the building. <b> you have been brought here</b>  from  Babylon.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And behold a wall outside the House</b>  He showed me the structure of one building on the north side  of the mountain and a wall on the outside going all around.

This is a cubit of  medium length which equals a cubit and a handbreadth using a cubit that equals five handbreadths. <b> width of the structure</b>  the thickness of the wall. <b> and the height one rod</b>  And this was the outside  wall, which surrounds the Temple Mount, and it was low, as we learned (in Middoth 2:4): All the walls  that were there were high except for the eastern wall, for the priest who would burn the [Red] Cow  would stand on the Mount of Olives [and would look directly at the entrance to the Temple proper at  the time of the sprinkling of the blood].  <b> 6</b>  <b> And he came to the gate that faced eastward</b>  he entered the enclosure and came to the eastern  gate of the Womens Court, which is called the Outside Court throughout this entire account, since  it is in front of the Israelites Court. <b> and he ascended its steps</b>  For the incline of the mountain ascends  gradually from the lower hel (an expanse and steps) up to the Womens Court, twelve steps, in  accordance with the Mishnah that we learned (Middoth 2:3): On its inner side, [i.e., on the inner side  of the fence] was the hel of ten cubits [width], and twelve steps were there, etc. <b> gate</b>  This is the doorpost of the gate. <b> one rod the width</b>  six cubits.

There were  three on the right of the gate and three on the left, as is stated in this section. The cells were near the  eastern wall of the Womens Court, on the outside, facing the Temple Mount. Now, from where do I  learn that they were on the outside? From what is written after this entire account (verse 17): And he  brought me to the outer Court. From here I learn that all that had been spoken of previously was  outside it, for he had not yet entered it. <b> And the cell was one rod in length, etc.</b>  The inner area of  each one was six cubits square. <b> and between the cells five cubits</b>  The walls separating the cells were  five cubits thick, and so did Jonathan render: and between the cells was a wall of five cubits, and so  we learned in Tractate Middoth (4:7): The wall of the cell was five [cubits.] <b> that was beside the hall of the gate, etc.</b>  [i.e.,] [extending] beyond the gate was a hall connected to  the gate, as is delineated in this account, protruding ten cubits into the Womens Court, and at its front  end were doors and posts, and this is what he meant by saying: and the post of the gate which  was next to the hall of the gate. <b> from inside</b>  [Heb.  מהבית  i.e.,] toward the inside. The width of one  rod covered the thickness of the wall of the hall, one on the right, [wall] and one on the left, for the  thickness of [each] wall of the hall - to the [hallways] right and to [its] left - was one rod, as he  explains further.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And he measured the hall of the gate from inside</b>  inward of the gate. <b> one rod</b>  The thickness of the  right and left walls upon which the hall was founded.  <b> 9</b>  <b> And he measured the hall of the gate eight cubits</b>  the length of its protrusion into the Womens  Court. <b> and its pillars</b>  Meselins in Old French, posts, pillars. All the pillars mentioned in this account  were sort of round trees made of hewn stone, standing in the entrance, one to the right and one to the  left, in place of posts, in place of doorposts, and so did Jonathan render (Isa. 1:4): And the doorposts  (אמותהספים)  quaked:  אילמתספיא . And they are called  אילים  because they were round like the  terebinth and like the oak  (וכאלון כאלה) . <b> and its pillars two cubits</b>  in diameter. They were standing at  the end of the hall space, this one attached to the right wall and this one to the left wall. The result is  that the [total] protrusion of the hall and its pillars was ten cubits beyond the gate, into the Court  interior. <b> and the hall of the gate from inside</b>  Since the hall of the Israelites Court Gate protruded and  extended outward, as is delineated in this account, he explains concerning the hall of the Womens  Court Gate that it [in contrast] extended inward. The Womens Court Gates were built in a straight  line with the gates of the Israelites Court, resulting in one hall facing another hall, which is a beautiful  thing.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And the cells of the gate</b>  [i.e., of] this [gate] that faced eastward - which was in the eastern wall of  the Womens Court - three were from here and three were from here: three to the south and three to  the north, next to the wall of the Womens Court, and facing the Temple Mount. The measurements of  each cells interior and the wall that intervened between one and another were explained above. <b> one measure for the pillars</b>  made for the halls posts on the inside. <b> from here and from here</b>  of the  right and of the left; their measurement was two cubits.  <b> 11</b>  <b> the width of the entrance of the gate</b>  The width of the span of the entrance, and so we learned  (Mid. 2:3): All the entrances...were ten cubits wide. <b> the length of the gate</b>  This is the span of the hall  of the gate from north to south. <b> thirteen cubits</b>  ten corresponding to the span of the entrance plus a  cubit and a half on this side and a cubit and a half on the other side. Now, do not wonder why in  respect to the entrance he calls it width and in respect to the span of the hall he calls it length, because  in respect to the entrance, its height and its length and the width is from post to post, but the hall, since  the extension of the protrusion of its east to west span is less than the measure of its north to south  span, as this is eight cubits and that is thirteen, he calls the larger measure length. And here is  evidence for the matter: in the Temple of [the Book of] Kings (I 6:3): And the hall before the Temple  of the House, twenty cubits [was] the length thereof, beyond the breadth of the House. We thus find  that north-to-south is called breadth as regards the Temple, yet, as regards the hall, it is called length,  because the east-to-west measurement of the Temple exceeded [its measurement] from north to south,  and with the hall, it was the opposite. [Hence,] you learn that the large measurement is [always] called  length.  <b> 12</b>  <b> And a border [area] was before the cells of one cubit, etc.</b>  The cells on either side of the gate  were inset [away] from being in line with the area of the inward-going hall, a cubit to the north and a  cubit to the south. For he already made it clear that on the inside, it [the space] was extended beyond  from the [the area] facing the space of the gate, a cubit and a half to the north and likewise to the  south. Now he explains that the cells which were on the outside were recessed to the north, one cubit  more than the hall, and likewise one cubit to the south. As a result, they were recessed from the area  of the [gates] entrances width, two and a half cubits to this side and two and a half cubits to this side.  This is [the meaning of] the word  וגבול , somayl in Old French, border, limit, an empty place. The  wall of the cell was five cubits thick, resulting in the thickness of the northern wall of the northern cell,  a nd the thickness of the northern wall of the hall, ending opposite each other. For the wall of the hall  was six cubits thick and the wall of the cell was five, and it was extended one cubit inward opposite  the thickness of the wall of the hall, and likewise, to the south.  <b> 13</b>  <b> And he measured the gate from the roof of the cell to its [other] roof</b>  from the roof of the cell at  the north of the gate to the roof of the cell at the south of the gate. <b> twenty-five cubits</b>  The thickness of  the wall of the cell was five [cubits], as was the thickness of the wall of the cell that was on the second  side, totaling ten [cubits]; and the two and a half cubits that it (some versions: the cell) was recessed  from the space of the entrance to this side and likewise to that side, totaled fifteen; and the space of  the entrance was ten cubits, making twenty-five. And all of these, which together make up the  measurement of the width of the gate, corresponded to the thirteen cubits of the space of the inward  going hall, plus the two walls, one rod from this side and one rod from that side, totaling twenty-five  [cubits]. <b> an entrance opposite an entrance</b>  The entrance of the cell that was next to the gate in the  south was directed exactly opposite the entrance of the cell that was next to the gate in the north, for  the six cells did not have an entrance in the outside wall, but the two cells nearest the gate had  entrances facing the space between the two of them, and so he says below (verse 16): and for their  doorposts [facing] toward the inward of the gate. This teaches us that their entrances faced the gate.  <b> 14</b>  <b> And he made the pillars sixty cubits</b>  The height of the pillars of the posts of the hall was sixty  cubits. <b> and [likewise] to the pillars of the court [and of] the gates all around</b>  And the same was for  all the pillars that were in all the halls of the gates all around. For also in the north and in the south the  gates were constructed like this gate, as is delineated in this account.  <b> 15</b>  <b> And the height of the entrance gate</b>  [Heb.  ועל פני השער ,] lit. and on the face of the gate. The  height of this gate. It is called  שער האיתון  because it serves as an entrance and exit for all who come into  the Temple court. [The word]  איתון  is Aramaic for  ביאה , entry. <b> ball of the gate</b>  together with the height of the hall of the gate, which is further in than the gate. <b> cubits</b>  And from the height of the other gates [mentioned] in this account, which were fifty cubits, I  learn that the  על פני  stated here means the height. (i.e., the outer gates height was fifty  cubits, together with the height of the entire hall:  just like the inner gate of the hall. For also at the  end of the hall is a[nother] gate, as was already made clear in verse 7.).  <b> 16</b>  <b> And narrowing windows [were made] for the cells</b>  These cells did not have doors facing the  outside, but one open to the other; and so we find in Tractate Middoth (4:3) regarding the cells around  the Temple: Each one had three entrances, one to the cell on the right, one to the cell on the left, and  one to the cell above. But as for the cells in the Court which were only three cells, one beside the  other, having no cells above them the middle ones had two entrances: one to the cell on the right and  one to the cell on the left; and the outer one, [standing] at the side of the gate, had two entrances: one  open to the middle one and one to the side of the gate, and it was likewise with the outer cell of the  other second side, on both sides of the gate, as is written above (verse 13): an entrance opposite an  entrance. Now these [cells] had windows   שקפים אטמים  both open and shut - [I Kings 6:4] - open  to the outside and shut to the inside, meaning narrow on the inside and wide on the outside to the  east. Menahem (p. 180) interpreted  שקפים  as being related to the word for looking  (השקפה) , as in  (Song 6:10) Who is this who looks forth  (הנשקפה)  ; (Ps. 102:20) For He has looked down  (השקיף)  from His holy height. He interprets [the word lintel in] (Exod. 12:22) to the lintel  (אל המשקוף)   also, as being related to the word for [over]looking. <b> the inward of the gate</b>  [i.e.], and to the edges of the entrances of the two cells nearest the gate on  this side and that side. For their entrances were [facing] towards the inner area of the gate: the  entrance of the northern cell on the north of the gate, and the entrance of the southern cell on the  south of the gate. The edges of the entrances on each side of the entrance of the cell are  the posts. And they had windows open to the intervening space - having the width of the gate -  which intervened between the cells. Now, he calls that space inward of the gate, for when someone  enters the area between the protrusions of the cells of here and there, it appears as though he has  entered the gate. <b> and likewise for the halls</b>  And so did the halls of every gate have windows. <b> windows all around [facing] inward</b>  in the wall, on the Courts side, on the inside. <b> were palm like crowns</b>  Jonathan renders:  כותרתא , crowns at the top of the pillar. They were made like  crowns, [each] resembling a palm tree, for in [the account about] Solomons Temple (I Kings 6:29)  they are translated by the Targum,  צורתדקלין  (shapes of palm trees), pomels, crowns.  <b> 17</b>  <b> and a balcony</b>  [Heb.  ורצפה ,] planchez in Old French, flooring, paving: and I say that it was a  surrounding balcony, like the one of which we learned (Middoth 2:5): Originally it had been quite  bare, but they surrounded it with a balcony and on that balcony were the chambers, chanbres in Old  French. And from that which is stated in this account And the balcony was to the side of the  gates, and its base was on line with the height of the gates - we learn that this flooring was a  balcony.  <b> 18</b>  <b> And the balcony was to the side of the gates</b>  The top of the gates of the Court separated the  balcony, so that it did not go around the entire Court, and [thus the balcony] was to the sides of the  gate from this side and from that side, parallel to the top of the gates. <b> the base of the balcony</b>  [Heb.  התחתונה .] This word is different from every  תחתונה  in the Scriptures, for everywhere the accent is  on the nun, whereas here, it is on the tav [so that the word is essentially  תחתון ]. We learn that this  תחתונה  was not a balcony that is under another one but was one balcony, and the base of this balcony  paralleled the top of the gate. The hey of  תחתונה  is like the hey of  ביתה  and like the hey of  עזרתה , and of  חלאתה , each of which is superfluous.  <b> 19</b>  <b> And he measured the width</b>  the area of the Womens Court. <b> in front of the lower gate</b>  This is the  gate delineated above. <b> in front of the Inner Court</b>  up to the Israelites Court. <b> north</b>  to two of its directions its space was one hundred cubits.  <b> 20</b>  <b> he measured its length and its width</b>  [to be] like the measurement of the eastern gate. This is  delineated in the section.  <b> 21</b>  <b> fifty cubits its length</b>  its height. <b> And twenty five cubits its width</b>  from the roof of one cell to the  roof of the other cell.  <b> 22</b>  <b> and its hall was beyond them</b>  The hall of the gate was beyond the steps; before he would enter  the hall, he would ascend the steps.  <b> 23</b>  <b> And the gate of the Inner Court</b>  of the Israelites Court. <b> opposite the gate</b>  directly opposite the  Outer [Gate]. <b> and he measured from gate</b>  [i.e., from the] Lower [Gate] until the Upper [Gate] one  hundred cubits. That is the width of the space of the Womens Court.  <b> 24</b>  <b> And he led me by way of the south</b>  of the Outer Court.  <b> 25</b>  <b> were like these windows</b>  [Heb.  כהחלנות .] Rabbi Tanhuma expounded (Buber, Behaalothecha p.  48): This hey is superfluous, to indicate the term  כהה , dark. Dark windows, wide on the outside and  narrow on the inside, as if to say, I do not need the light, for all windows made to bring in light are  narrow on the outside and wide on the inside.  <b> 26</b>  <b> its steps</b>  [Heb.  עלותו ,] like  מעלותו , its steps. <b> on its posts</b>  Atop the post was pictured a palm tree.  <b> 28</b>  <b> and he measured the Southern Gate</b>  of the Inner Court.  <b> 30</b>  <b> And arcades</b>  [Heb.  ואלמות ,] arboz in Old French. <b> round about</b>  The wall was made of many halls  running through its thickness. These halls were inside [(absent in other editions:) above the cells. For  the cells were inside, in the Inner Court, for the hall of the gate protruded into the outer [court], as is  included in the account, and it is impossible for [both] the cells and the hall to have been facing the  same area so that the entrances of the cells [too] could have opened to the inside of the hall, for the  account equates all the measurements of the outer gates with those of the inner ones, and it  distinguishes between them only as regards the protrusion of the halls.] (For the cells were outside, and  six cells and their walls and the fifteen cubits of the width of the gate total eighty-one cubits, whereas  the entire Inner Court is only one hundred by one hundred, as is specified in the account. Absent in  other editions).  <b> 31</b>  <b> And its halls to the Outer Court</b>  The halls of the Inner Gate were not toward the inner side as  were the halls of the Outer Gate, but were protruding outward.  <b> 36</b>  <b> fifty cubits long</b>  Its height was fifty cubits.  <b> 37</b>  <b> And its pillars were toward the Outer Court</b>  Et ses portiques in French, and its porticoes, and  the hall of the gate is called  אילים  here.  <b> 38</b>  <b> And a chamber</b>  was beside the Northern Gate in the Israelites Court. <b> and its entrance</b>  [The  entrance] of the chamber faced the posts of the gate. <b> in [line with] the pillars of the gates</b>  In this  chapter, there are verses that call the sides of the gates  אילים , meselins in Old French, posts, pillars. <b> there they would rinse the burnt offering</b>  the burnt offering, that was slaughtered in the north. <b> would rinse the burnt offering</b>  they would wash the innards.  <b> 39</b>  <b> And in the hall of the gate</b>  [i.e., of] the Northern [Gate]. <b> two tables</b>  in its east and two in its west,  and although they extended into the Outer Court area, their sanctity was as [great as] those things of  the Inner [Court area].  <b> 40</b>  <b> And to the outer side</b>  and to the entrance side of the hall, which was outside the hall interior,  leading into the entrance area of (some editions: the side of) the Israelites Court. <b> ascends to the entrance of the Northern Gate</b>  When one enters within the gate and ascends the steps  of the entrance of the Court. <b> two tables</b>  to the side of the entrance, to the east or to the west. <b> the other side</b>  of the entrance of the hall, were two tables.  <b> 42</b>  <b> upon them they would lay the implements</b>  Upon them they lay the knives and the basins in which  the blood is received to be ready for [use by] those who slaughter the holiest sacrifices [Kodshei  Kodoshim] in the north.  <b> 43</b>  <b> And the hooks one handbreadth</b>  iron hooks attached to short pillars in the slaughtering area in the  north upon which the hallowed animals were hung and flayed, as we learned in Pes. (5:9): Iron hooks  were attached to the pillars and to the walls upon which they would hang and flay [the sacrifices].  Jonathan renders likewise: And hooks extending one handbreadth. <b> attached on the inside</b>  attached  within the interior of the Court.  בבית  means inside.  <b> 44</b>  <b> And outside the Inner Gate</b>  outside the gates hall space, within the Inner Courts space, as  explained at the end of this verse. <b> the chambers of the choristers</b>  the chambers of the Levites who  sing. <b> and they faced southward</b>  their entrance[s] were towards the south. <b> Eastern Gate</b>  One chamber was to the side of the Eastern Gate. <b> facing northward</b>  Its entrance was  toward the north.  <b> 45</b>  <b> for the priests</b>  who served [in] the Temple. These are apparently the Levite choristers.  <b> 47</b>  <b> And he measured the Court</b>  the interior of the Israelites Court [situated] before the Hall and the  Temple proper.  <b> 48</b>  <b> to the Hall of the Temple</b>  the Hall of the Heichal. <b> and he measured the pillars of the hall</b>  [Heb.  אל אלם ,] like  אל אלם , the pillars of the hall; the thickness of the sides of the entrance (that look toward  the east absent in some editions) he measured from east to west. (And I, the copyist, found in other  commentaries as I copied.) <b> and the width of the gate, three cubits from here, etc.</b>  That was the  width of the northern pillar [going] into the hall space to the west. So too was the thickness of the  southern pillar which went inside the Hall on the west. And although we learned that (Mid. 4:7): The  wall of the Hall was five [cubits] and the Hall was eleven, that of the future Temple will only be  three, but in the Hall of the Second Temple etc. - absent in some editions.) <b> five cubits</b>  That of the  Second Temple was the same, for so we learned (Mid. 4:7): The wall of the Hall was five [cubits] and  the Hall was eleven [cubits], except that there were no [front wall] sides to the entrance on the north  and south in the Hall of the Second Temple. The width of the entrance was twenty cubits, just as the  width of the Hall, and here it says, and the width of the gate: three cubits over here and three cubits  over there, (and I do not know how to reconcile it) except [to say] that the width of the front sides of  the entrance was three cubits closing in on the space of the entrance here and three cubits there.  <b> 49</b>  <b> The length of the Hall was twenty cubits</b>  corresponding to the width of the Temple. <b> width was eleven cubits</b>  from east to west. <b> and with the steps upon which they would ascend to it </b> And they ascended to it by way of the steps, as we learned (Mid. 3:6): Between the Hall and the altar  were twenty-two cubits, and twelve steps were there, the height of each step being one half  cubit. <b> and pillars to the posts</b>  instead of Jachin and Boaz (I Kings 7:21) which were in the First  Temple.   <b> Chapter 41</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> six cubits wide</b>  That is the width of the wall of the Heichal, between the Heichal and the hall (from  east to west). <b> the width of the tent</b>  the width of the Hall, for it was in the width of the Hall and in the  length of the Heichal. (In other commentaries:) The width of the tent - the tent of the entrance.  <b> 2</b>  <b> and the sides of the entrance were five cubits</b>  for the Heichal was twenty cubits wide and the  width of the entrance was ten. Its sides from here and there are found to be five cubits each.  <b> 3</b>  <b> And he came to the interior</b>  to the wall that separated the Heichal from the Holy of Holies. <b> measured the pillar of the entrance</b>  Its thickness was two cubits. This was not equal to the cubit for  the partition. <b> and the entrance six cubits</b>  I cannot explain this except as a reference to its height.  <b> 4</b>  <b> to the face of the Temple</b>  on the face of the width of the Temple.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And he measured the wall</b>  the western wall. <b> and the width of the cell</b>  [Heb.  הצלע ,] apendiz in  Old French. The interior of the cell behind it was four amos in measurement, and in the Second  Temple it was six (amos). And perforce this Temple is the one of the future, because there was no wall  separating the Holy of Holies in the Second Temple.  <b> 6</b>  <b> thirty-three times</b>  But in the Second Temple, there were thirty-eight: fifteen in the north, and  fifteen in the south - five upon five, and five atop them - and eight in the west. [The term]  צלע  is  synonymous with  יציע  and with  תא . I say that the cells in the north and the south were arranged as  follows: each one was twelve cubits long, totaling sixty cubits for five cells, and five walls of five  cubits each, totaling 85. The width of the cleared space was five cubits. Thus you have accounted for  ninety cubits of the length of the wall, and so to the south. Those in the west were one on top of  another, and a third atop them, and their length across their top was twenty cubits, paralleling the  width of the Holy of Holies, making eleven in each row. So did Jonathan render: eleven in a row. <b> thirty-three times</b>  eleven upon eleven, and eleven atop them. So did Jonathan render: eleven in a  row, but in the Second Temple etc.... and with  תא , and no more.) <b> the wall</b>  The beams of the cells of the top story - their ends on the side toward the cells outer wall  would rest upon the wall, on its inner side, and puncture it. This is the meaning of the inside of the  wall of the cells into the side that was toward the interior of the cells; and this is the meaning of that  they might hold therein, - be fastened securely, po[r]pris in Old French, firmly held. <b> not be held in the wall of the House</b>  Their ends on the side toward the wall of the Heichal rested on,  and penetrated the recesses, i.e., the wall of the Heichal protruded into the interior of the cells, as it is  stated regarding Solomons [Temple] building (I Kings 6:6): for he made rebatements in [the wall of]  the House round about on the outside. The width of the interior of the nethermost chamber was five  cubits, and its upper story was six, for the wall of the Heichal was recessed from above one cubit;  therefore the interior of the nethermost one was five cubits wide and the third chamber was seven  cubits wide and this was atop the middle one, which had the wall of the Heichal protruding into it one  cubit from above and these too were like them. And this is what is meant by and they would nor be  held in the wall of the House; they did not penetrate into the wall of the Heichal as do ends of other  low beams which are fastened onto a high wall, i.e., [builders usually] make holes in the wall and  thrust the beams into the holes.  <b> 7</b>  <b> And it became wider</b>  And the cells constantly widened as they went upward, as I explained: the  middle one was a cubit wider than the lowest one, and the uppermost [one] was a cubit [wider] than  the middle one. <b> and it wound higher and higher</b>  [Heb.  ונסבה ,] and it was surrounded by a spiral  staircase, fiz in Old French. This is a stone structure similar to a pillar, with steps winding around it.  It seems to the person who is ascending upon it that he is encircling a stone pillar. In German it is  called a wendelstein. This is what is [meant when it is] stated regarding Solomons Temple (I Kings  6:8): and upon winding stairs  (לולים)  they went up into the middle [chamber]. That too is  translated [into Aramaic] as  ובמסיבתא , like  ונסבה למעלה למעלה  and it wound higher and higher. The  spiral staircase continued to wind higher and higher up to the roof of the uppermost cell, as he  proceeds to explain, [so] that the spiral staircase ascended from the nethermost cell to the middle  one and from the middle one to the uppermost one. <b> for the encompassing of the House</b>  to the cells. <b> went upward round about the House: therefore, the widest part of the House was above </b> Therefore, we said, And it became wider and it wound higher and higher. The widest part of the  House within the cells was above. The uppermost [cell] was wider than all of them. <b> the nethermost</b>  Jonathan rendered: And so, with the spiral staircase they would ascend from the  nethermost to the uppermost through the middle one. And so they would ascend with the spiral  staircase from the nethermost one to the uppermost one by way of the middle one.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And I saw that the House had a height</b>  He does not delineate its measurement, but we learn in  Tractate Middoth (4:6): with a height of one hundred cubits. <b> full length of a rod</b>  The foundation of the cells was the full length of a rod. <b> six cubits was its span </b> [Heb.  אצילה .] Jonathan renders: span. [The part] of the foundation of the stone wall within the earth  was six cubits wide, but [the part] above the earth was five cubits wide, as is delineated in this section  in the following verse.  <b> 9</b>  <b> The width of the wall of the cell to the outside</b>  The wall of the cells adjoining the Court; i.e., the  western wall. <b> was five cubits</b>  And we also learned in Tractate Middoth (4:7), that the wall was five  cubits [wide]. <b> and what was left clear</b>  And a clear area was left at the northern and southern corners  that adjoined the east and the west. For the cells did not encompass the entire House, and the  entrances of the cells in the eastern corners led to that cleared area - as is stated in this section: And  the entrance of the cell to the clear space. The cells had no entrances either to the side of the Court  or to the side of the Heichal, but to those in the northeastern [corner] and the southeastern corner, had  an the entrance in the wall which opened to the cleared off area. And by that entrance they would  enter it, and from it, into the second cell, and from the second into the third, and so on all around, as  we learned in Tractate Middoth (4:3): and an area left over. Another explanation: <b> left clear</b>  Those  on the inside of the cells that were toward the side of the House was left clear; i.e., a clear area was  left over between the cells and the House, and in the area were the cells entrances, as is delineated in  this section: And the entrance of the cell was toward the clear place, and its width was five cubits,  as [Scripture] says: and the width of the clear area was five cubits, as I explained above, [i.e.,] that  the cells will not be close to the House at all, and there will be a space of five cubits between them and  the House. And so did Jonathan render: and an area left over. <b> to the House</b>  Opposite the space of the width of the cells in the corner. The words round  about, written about the clear area, are not referring to [all] four corners, but mean here and  there, i.e., south and north: the southeastern and the northeastern corners.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And between the chambers was a width of twenty cubits</b>  There were chambers in the Outer  Court, at the north and at the south of the Inner Court, near its wall. And there was a space twenty  cubits wide between the walls of the chambers and the walls of the cells that were around the House.  It was not so in the Second Temple edifice, but [it will be so] in the future edifice.  <b> 11</b>  <b> And the entrance of the cell was toward the clear space</b>  And the entrances of the outside cells  were open to the left over clear area in the corner, as I explained.  <b> 12</b>  <b> And the structure that was before the fortress, etc.</b>  The width of the entire structure on the  western side - the width of the House and the thickness of the northern and southern wall, with the  northern and southern cells, and the thickness of their walls on the north and on the south - equaled  seventy cubits, and so too it was in the Second Temple. And so we learned in Tractate Middoth (4:7)  about the western wall: From north to south - seventy cubits, and it computes the calculation. <b> fortress</b>  [Heb.  הגזרה .] Jonathan renders: the fortress. And I say that the tall House was called [the  fortress] and that the low cells that were around it were called the structure. Menahem, however,  (page. 54) interpreted  גזרה  as a chamber. <b> the side that was toward the west</b> . [Heb.  דרך ים , lit. the  way of the (Mediterranean) Sea.] The western side. <b> cubits wide</b>  And the width of the structure on the western side, from north to south, was seventy  cubits, and here you have the computation: The northern cell was 4 [cubits], and its walls 10, totaling  14. The clear area between the cell and the House was 5 [cubits], totaling 19. The width of the  foundation of the walls was included in the interior of the cell and in the clear place. The wall of the  Heichal was 6 [cubits], totaling 25, and its interior was 20 [cubits] wide, totaling 45 [cubits]. The  southern wall of the Heichal was 6, adding up to 51, and with the 19 [cubits] of the southern cells, the  grand total is 70 [cubits]. <b> and the wall of the structure</b>  the walls of the cells. <b> cubits long</b>  The length of the structure of the cells and the clear place was ninety cubits [in] the north  and [in] the south, not including the depository of the knives, which is not counted because it  protruded outward to the north and to the south, and was not the same shape as the rest of the  structure. The House was thirty cubits wider in the front than in the back, as we learned (Middoth 4:  7): The Hall exceeded the Heichal by fifteen cubits in the north and fifteen cubits in the south, and  that [longer area] was called the Depository of the Knives, because there they stored the knives. The  length of that structure from east to west was ten cubits. This leaves 90 cubits of length with 70 cubits  width, for the entire House was 100 cubits long on both sides, as is delineated in this section and in  Tractate Middoth (4:6).  <b> 13</b>  <b> And he measured the House, its length was one hundred cubits</b>  the grand total, including the  extension of the Depository of the Knives. So we learned in Tractate Middoth [concerning the  Second Temple] (4:6): The Heichal was 100 by 100, with a height of 100 cubits. (4:7) From east to  west, the Halls wall was 5 cubits and its width, 11; the wall of the Heichal was 6 cubits and its  length was 40; the partition was 1 cubit; the Holy of Holies was 20 cubits; the wall of the Heichal  was 6 cubits; the cell was 6 cubits; and the wall of the cell was 5 cubits. Above, in this section,  [which concerns the Third Temple] as well, all of their measurements are explained in the same way,  except for the [single] cubit for the partition, concerning which it is written in this section (verse  3): two cubits, but counterbalancing that, it decreases the width of the cell by a cubit, for the cell  in the Mishnah was 6 cubits wide and its wall was 5 [totaling 11 cubits], and here its width is 4 and  its wall is 6 [totaling only 10 cubits] as it is written (verse 8): the foundations of the cells were the  full length of a rod, and though higher up it became narrower and recessed a cubit, as it is written  (verse 9): and the wall of the cell was five cubits. <b> walls</b>  The end of the verse explains its beginning, saying that [it is] the sum total [that] was one  hundred cubits.  <b> 14</b>  <b> And the width of the front of the House and the fortress to the east was one hundred cubits </b> The fortress and the cell that was behind it that is  הבניה , the structure - like  בנין  - and the  thickness of the walls, all added up to one hundred cubits. For I explained above that the House was  thirty cubits wider in front, for the Hall spread out wider than the Heichal and the cells, fifteen cubits  to the north and fifteen cubits to the south. Not that the interior of the Hall was wider than the interior  of the Heichal, but that the depository for the knives was attached to the Hall on either side.  <b> 15</b>  <b> And he measured the length of the structure before the fortress, which was behind it</b>  [Heb.  אשר  על אחריה , lit. that was on its back.] Now he returns and measures the length of the House on the south,  as he measured it on the north. (I found:) And that is the meaning of behind it, i.e., backwards, for  he returned and measured by turning around, turning on his heels, toward the west. <b> and its corners </b> [Heb.  ואתקיהא , and its extremities.] Jonathan renders: its corners; i.e., with the extended section  making up the depository for the knives, which was at the corners of the house. <b> Sanctum and the Halls of the Court</b>  The end of this verse is not related to its beginning, but is  connected to the following verse, and this is its explanation: And the Heichal as well as the Inner  Sanctum - which is the Holy of Holies - as well as the Halls of the Court delineated above -(30:  40) and the Halls round about - all these had posts, narrowing windows, and attikim surrounding  the three of them, including the gizrah, which is the Heichal, (the Halls), and the Holy of Holies. The  three of them had the sippim, posts for their entrances, and the three of them had narrowing  windows, and the three of them had attikim. I do not know what they are. I say, however, that they  are a sort of square column protruding into the wall for reinforcement, they are called piliers in French,  pillars.  <b> 16</b>  <b> opposite the posts was a wooden board</b>  [Heb.  שחיף עץ .] Jonathan renders: a board of cedar wood. <b> opposite the posts</b>  opposite the posts of the entrance, within the interior space framed by the  thickness of the entrance, which was covered with wood (not found in all editions). I found. <b> about</b>  That is to say: here and there, on both sides of the interior of the entrance. <b> until the windows</b>  The base of the wall was made into a wall of cedar wood boards opposite it, and it  ascended upward until the windows, and the windows were also covered with it. It is thus found that  the windows were also closed from the inside, as it is said (here) (40:16): And closed windows to the  house. (sic) And all this was [done] on the inside because they would spread upon it a gold plating -  for the entire inside was spread over with gold - and gold cannot be spread upon stones.  <b> 17</b>  <b> On [the wall] over the entrance</b>  on high. <b> and until the Inner House</b>  the Holy of Holies  throughout its entirety. <b> and outward</b>  towards the Heichal. <b> round about</b>  on all its walls. <b> One and in the Outer One</b>  In the Holy of Holies and in the Heichal. <b> [made according to] measure</b> .  [Lit. measures.] Covered with large boards made to measure.  <b> 18</b>  <b> And [it was] made of cherubim and palm trees</b>  And that cedar wood was decorated with  cherubim and palm trees. <b> and the cherub had two faces</b>  One, the face of a young lion, and one, the  face of a man. This one faced this way, and that one faced that way, and when the palm tree was  between one cherub and another cherub, the face of the young lion was toward it from this side, and  the face of man from that side, as is stated in this account.  <b> 19</b>  <b> made upon the entire House</b>  of the Holy of Holies.  <b> 20</b>  <b> and on the wall of the Temple</b>  And so on the wall of the Temple.  <b> 21</b>  <b> a square doorpost</b>  [Heb.  רבעה .] I heard that in Solomons edifice, the doorpost was fourfold; i.e.,  it had doorposts on both sides, a threshold below and a lintel above, but I say that the doorposts were  square. <b> like [that] appearance</b>  Jonathan rendered: Its appearance was like the appearance of His  Glory - like the appearance of the Throne of Glory that I saw in the Chariot by the River Chebar; I  saw a bright light in the Holy of Holies.  <b> 22</b>  <b> The altar was wood</b>  Jonathan renders: Standing for the altar was the table, i.e., the table is  called an altar because nowadays it atones like an altar. <b> and its corners</b>  its legs; and the words its  length, mentioned in the verse refer to its roof, the main part of the Table. <b> and its walls</b>  its frames.  <b> 23</b>  <b> And...two doors</b>  to each entrance, closing one opposite the other, one on the northern doorpost  and one on the southern doorpost.  <b> 24</b>  <b> And the doors had two doors each</b>  The entrance of the Heichal had two pairs of doors, as we  learned in Middoth (4:1): It had four doors, two on the inner side and two on the outer side... The  outside doors opened [swinging] into the entrance space, overlaying the thickness of the wall. For it  [the walls depth] was six cubits, and the door was five cubits wide, measuring half the width of the  entrance, and was recessed a cubit within the doorpost, with the result that the thickness of the wall  had five cubits exposed, and when the outside door was opened toward the inside, it would cover it;  and the inner doors would [swing] open toward the interior of the House, covering up [the area of the  doorpost] behind the doors, for the entire House was overlaid with gold except [for the area of the  doorpost] the doors. Rabbi Yehudah says: Also the inner doors stayed within the entrance, and were in  the form of double doors. And they would fold back upon one another. These were two and a half  cubits, and these were two and a half cubits, and a half cubit of the doorpost was here and a cubit and  a half of the doorpost here, as it is said: And the doors had two doors [each], two turning doors,  etc. Now this is its explanation: Both the inner doors and the outer doors stood in the area demarcated  by the thickness of the wall. These were recessed one half cubit further in along the doorpost. The  inner doors would open toward the outer doors, and the outer doors toward the inner doors. How so?  Two doors of five cubits each would open one opposite the other along five cubits width of the  thickness of the wall. They were composed of leaves, and at their midpoint they would fold back when  they were opened, like the wooden tablets upon which [scribes] write using an iron stylus, which fold  up one behind the other. The result is that when they were folded, they [each] stood at two and a half  cubits, and when they were opened one against the other, they [together] covered five cubits of the  thickness of the wall.  <b> 25</b>  <b> and a wooden beam before the Hall</b>  [Heb.  ועב ,] tref in Old French. Poles of cedar wood were  attached from the wall of the Heichal to the wall of the Hall so that it should not slant down. So we  learned in Tractate Middoth (3:8): And a beam projected from the wall of the House and came to the  outside facade of the Hall.  <b> 26</b>  <b> to the sides of the Hall</b>  The two sides of the entrance. <b> beams</b>  And he showed me the supports and the beams. And our Rabbis of blessed memory said (Bava  Kamma 67a): The  צלעותהבית  refer to  מלטסים . And the  עבים  refer to  מרישות . Now what are  מרישות  ?  They are beams. And what are  מלטסים  ? They are cedar planks placed at the tops of walls, upon  which the ends of the beams are lain.   <b> Chapter 42</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> And he took me out</b>  of the Inner Court. <b> to the Outer Court</b>  through the Northern Gate mentioned  above (40:35): The gate of the Inner Court was opposite the gate to the north, and it was situated in  the middle of the length of the Israelites Court, which was one hundred cubits. <b> the chamber that was opposite, etc.</b>  To one of the first chambers, or to the place of the chambers,  chanbrediz in Old French, block of chambers. These are the chambers standing north of the House,  separated twenty cubits from the cells, as is written above (41:10), And between the chambers was a  [space] twenty cubits wide surrounding the House. Someone [standing in the inner court] would be  unable to enter those chambers or the twenty [cubit] wide space between them and the cells except  through the Outer Court, as is made clear below in this section. For he states that the Inner Court was  one hundred [cubits] by one hundred [cubits] square before the House, to the east; and he states  concerning the width of the eastern side of the House: one hundred cubits. Ergo, the width of the  House blocked off the width of the Inner Court, and one could not enter the Inner [Court if he was  starting] from the sides of the chambers of either the north or the south. Therefore, one had to come to  those chambers by way of the outer Northern Court. <b> that was opposite the fortress</b>  Those chambers  were parallel to the entire one hundred cubit east-to-west length of the House, as is stated in the  section concerning [the east-west length of] these chambers (verse 8): and behold, facing the Temple  was one hundred cubits.  <b> 2</b>  <b> Opposite the hundred cubit length span to the northern entrance</b>  [He brought me] to the  entrance of the chamber that faced north, towards the Outer Court. And he saw before him a fifty-  cubit wide space [extending] until the northern wall of the Outer Court, and the length was one  hundred cubits. For the chambers occupy one hundred cubits from east to west, and its width from  north to south was fifty cubits, as is stated below in this section, and the interior of the Outer Court  was [a total of] one hundred cubits wide, as is stated above (40:23): and he measured, from gate to  gate, one hundred cubits. We thus find that before the chambers was an empty space one hundred  cubits long and fifty cubits wide.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Opposite the twenty of the Inner Court</b>  All this is [meant as] an indication of the location of the  chambers [that were] beside the twenty [cubit] wide space of the Inner Court surrounding the House,  as it is stated above (41:10): And between the chambers was a [space] twenty cubits wide. <b> opposite the balcony of the Outer Court</b>  For [as] we stated above, the Court was encompassed by a  surrounding balcony. <b> a pillar opposite a pillar</b>  [Heb.  אתיק ,] I do not know what this is. <b> A pillar opposite a pillar</b>  An  אתיק  is a pillar, as Rashi explained [on] (41:15): and the pillars  (והאתיקים)  were around the three of them, i.e., they surrounded the upper chambers, [and he  calls them upper ones because they are at the top of the (Temple) Mount, as Rashi explained regarding  (verse 9):] And below these chambers. And here is a running commentary [of these verses]: <b> the uppermost chambers</b>  which were at the height of the mountain - two of them were narrow i.e.,  they were not wide because the pillars would decrease them, for builders reinforce the work on their  building by making pillars up to two thirds of the wall [which], from there on, slant to a point.  Therefore, the third story was not narrow. This is what Scripture means (verse 6): For they were three  storied, and they did not have pillars; they did not need to be strengthened as did the lower  ones. And they did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts, i.e., the pillars of these chambers  were not like all other pillars, insofar as other pillars are established beside walls for reinforcement,  whereas these were [set] within the thickness of the wall, and protruded outward and inward.  Therefore, they consumed part of the building. <b> [6] Therefore...were deprived</b>  Targum renders,  דחיקן ,  were pressed, since they were in the thickness of the wall, protruding outward and inward,  strengthening the chambers. <b> the lowest and middle stories...of ground space</b>  [Heb.  מהארץ , lit. from the  ground] Toward the ground. This I found in the name of a great oak.) <b> three-storied</b>  [Heb.  בשלשים ,]  threefold, implying that those chambers were threefold - three, one over another; and the verses  indicate this too, for [Scripture] states (verse 5): And the uppermost chambers were narrow...more  than the lowest stories and the middle stories. But I could not understand, regarding these three  verses, what the meaning of for the attikim consumed is. What were those attikim and how did  they consume parts of the upper stories and not any of the lowest and middle stories? And the  explanation he gives for the matter, viz. that they had no pillars - I do not know how to understand  it. (And I had no teacher or aid concerning this entire edifice; only as they showed me from heaven.)  <b> 4</b>  <b> one cubit</b>  It appears to me that since the interior of [each side of] the Outer [Court] was one  hundred [cubits] wide from north to south, and of these, the chambers were [occupying a] fifty  [cubit] width, and before them was a fifty [cubit] space on the north - here is [already accounted for]  the entire width of the Court. It is thus found that the entire width of the [Inner] Court was blocked  off, i.e., there was no space between the chambers and the extremity of the depository for the  knives, and there was no passageway through which to enter the twenty [cubit] space between the  chambers and the cells; The twenty cubit space that intervened between the cells and the chambers  consisted of the fifteen cubits that were behind the depository for the knives, and five cubits in  addition to them. Now if you ask, If so, there is a space of five cubits between the corner of [the  depository for] the knives and the corner of the chambers? [I will answer that] the thickness of the  wall that intervenes between the Inner Court and the Outer Court blocks him from east to west. For  its thickness is six cubits, and its end terminates at the corner [formed by] the end of the one hundred  [cubit] length of the Inner Court [meeting] with the corner of the depository of the knives.  Therefore, there can be no passageway to that space of twenty [cubits], either in the Inner [Court] or  in the Outer [Court] unless there would be a diagonal entrance [inserted] - where the end of the wall  between the two courts terminates - in the thickness of the wall, a cubit [wide], enough for a man to  enter. One would enter into the five cubit space that is between the [the depository for] the knives  and the wall of the Chamber, and [then] walk through that space, toward the west, ten cubits. There,  the extension of the depository for the knives terminates, and one enters the twenty [cubits] wide  space. This is the meaning of what it says, a walk of ten cubits width [going] to the innermost one, a  way of one cubit. For he enters it by way of an entrance of one cubit, which [starts to] enter  diagonally at the end of the wall. Now why does he call it a walk of...width? Should he not say, a  walk of ten cubits length? Because regarding the housing for the knives, it refers to the width, since  the housing for the knives is fifteen cubits from north to south and only ten cubits from east to west. <b> and their entrances were to the north</b>  And the entrances of these chambers were to the north. I  found [the following]: And this is the meaning of the northern entrance written above. There he  stated it briefly, and here is its explanation.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And the uppermost chambers, etc.</b>  For they were three-storied, etc. I do not understand them at  all. <b> because the pillars consumed</b>  [Heb.  יוכלו ,] like  יאכלו , consumed. Consuming and decreasing  the space of the chambers.  <b> 7</b>  <b> And the outer wall, etc.</b>  that intervenes between the chambers and the Outer Court of the eastern  side. <b> its length being fifty cubits</b>  from north to south.  <b> 8</b>  <b> For the length of the chambers</b>  from north to south, was fifty cubits. <b> Temple</b>  from east to west, paralleling the Hall and the Temple and House of the Ark Cover, [i.e., the  Holy of Holies] and the cells, were one hundred cubits.  <b> 9</b>  <b> And below these chambers</b>  I do not know whether this comes to teach that they had tunnels  beneath them, or whether it comes to teach that there were chambers in the east of the Court, and  [that] since the mountain slopes [downward] to the east, he calls it and below these chambers. And  he is saying this: And at the lowest point of the Court, to the approach that was on the east as one  comes to them from the outer Court.  <b> 10</b>  <b> Along the width of the wall of the Court, etc.</b>  One who comes from the east of the Outer Court  and veers to the north by way of the outside of the northeastern corner of the Inner [Courts] walls, to  come to those chambers in the north, will find, facing the wall of the [Outer] Court, the eastern wall of  the Inner Court, which is west of the Outer [Court] opposite the fortress and the building in the Inner  [Court]. <b> chambers</b>  adjacent to that wall, and standing in the Outer (Court).  <b> 11</b>  <b> And the way before them</b>  there was a road before these chambers whose width [was the same as]  the space of the Court: fifty cubits. Its appearance was the same as that of the pathway to the  chambers that were on the northern side, mentioned above (verse 4). <b> as was their length</b>  [The length]  of the northern chambers was the length of these, and the same was so of their width. <b> exits</b>  were like the exit of the northern chambers. <b> and as their measurements and as their entrances </b> [i.e., the measurements and the entrances] of the northern chambers.  <b> 12</b>  <b> And as the entrances of the chambers that are toward the way of the south</b>  the eastern  entrances of the chambers. For in the south, too, there were chambers separated from the southern  cells by twenty cubits (as it is written) above (41:10): And between the chambers was a [space]  twenty cubits wide surrounding the House, round about. <b> pathway</b>  The eastern chambers had an entrance at the beginning of the pathway, and the pathway was  before the wall of the musicians. Jonathan renders: the platform of the Levites. The expression  הגדרתהגינה  means a stone wall structure made like steps upon which the musicians and the  choristers stood. <b> the way of the east</b>  For the platform was in the east, as it is written in (II Chron. 5:  12) in the chapter commencing: was completed: And the Levites who sang, all of them - Asaph,  Heman, Jeduthun, etc., stood east of the altar.  <b> 14</b>  <b> When the priests arrive, etc.</b>  Once they enter those chambers to eat. <b> they shall not go out</b>  of  them, which are holy. <b> into the Outer Court</b>  with the holy raiment that is upon them. <b> leave their garments, etc., and they will approach those of the people</b>  And they may approach to  touch the peoples garments if they wish, but they must not touch the [garments of] people with the  priestly raiment, for they have higher degrees of ritual purity, and ordinary garments have midras  contamination on them.  <b> 15</b>  <b> and he measured it round about</b>  the entire outer perimeter of the Temple Mount.  <b> 20</b>  <b> On four sides he measured it</b>  Three thousand cubits by three thousand [cubits], for the rod was  six cubits long. This is what the Kalir asserted, The Beloved will stretch out a line of three thousand  cubits limited by three thousand cubits. This is thirty-six times the original dimensions - for the  Temple Mount was [originally] five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits; arrange 3,000 times 3,000  as strips of 500 cubits laid vertically and horizontally [forming a solid square], and you will have  thirty-six squares of 500 cubits by 500 cubits. [3,000 x 3,000 = 9,000,000. 500 x 500 = 250,000. 9,  000,000 divided by 250,000 = 36.] Therefore, the poet states: And thirty-six as it was multiplied. <b> four sides he measured it: its wall all around</b>  [i.e., the wall] of the Temple Mount. <b> hundred</b>  in length and in width. This was the wall that encompassed the entire mountain. <b> to separate </b> the people between the holy which was inside, and the profane which was outside. I found the  completion of every measure. (This does not appear in other editions.)   <b> Chapter 43</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> And he led me</b>  He again led me into the Eastern Gate, and I saw the Glory descending to the Court.  <b> 3</b>  <b> And it was like the appearance of the vision, etc.</b>  [Heb.  וכמראה המראה .] Nine visions [or mirrors]  (מראות)  are written here through which the prophets perceived. Moses, however, was an exception, for  he saw through one vision. Therefore, his mirror reflected clearly and he saw reality more closely. And  this is [what is behind] the words of the liturgical poet. The mirrors polished with nine visions. <b> came to destroy the city</b>  in the section (9:4) of and you shall mark a sign, where it says (verse  1): Bring near those appointed over the city, and delineates the form of the Celestial Chariot.  <b> 6</b>  <b> speaking to me</b>  [Heb.  מדבר ,] speaking to Himself with me.

I found: and all its forms is  unclear. <b> so that they keep</b>  They will learn the matters of the measurements from your mouth so that  they will know how to do them at the time of the end. I found [the following]: The second aliyah [to  the Holy Land] through Ezra was merited to be like the first entry through Joshua, to come about by  force and through a miracle, as expounded (Ber. 4a, Exod. 15:16): until... pass. This Building would  then have been fit for them as of then, when they emerged from exile, to an everlasting redemption.  But [their] sin caused [this not to happen] for their repentance was not suitable, [i.e.,] they did not  resolve to stop sinning. [Therefore,] they emerged to freedom [only] through the sanction of Cyrus and  his son. Some say that in Babylon they stumbled regarding gentile women.  <b> 13</b>  <b> And these are the measurements of the altar</b>  as he explains further (verse 17): fourteen [cubits  in] length by fourteen [cubits in] breadth. <b> in cubits; the cubit, one cubit and a handbreadth</b>  with a  cubit of six [handbreadths], which is a cubit and a handbreadth, [judging] by a cubit of five  [handbreadths]. <b> but the base one [ordinary] cubit</b>  but its base is measured with an ordinary cubit,  which equals five [handbreadths]. The word  חיק  is related to  חקוי , permanence, it refers to the one  cubit. The cubit is the ordinary cubit, not a cubit and a handbreadth, which is the cubit of six  [handbreadths]. So too did we learn in Menahoth (97b) that the base, the circuit, and the horns are  measured with a cubit of five [handbreadths]. <b> but the base one [ordinary] cubit</b>  This is the yesod. <b> and such a cubit also for the breadth</b>  This is the circuit. <b> span to its edge all around</b>  These are the horns, [each of which measured] one span from its center;  and they measured a span to each side, totaling a cubit by a cubit. <b> altar</b>  And with this cubit the top of the golden altar was measured [to be] a cubit in length and a cubit  in breadth [forming a] square. So it is explained in Erubin (4a). In Menahoth (97b) it is explained more  fully in terms of the computation: The base was a cubit in height. It extended upward a cubit, and a  cubit was its breadth. The recess of the circuit was recessed a cubit of five [handbreadths], but its  height, of which we learned (Middoth 3:1): It extended upward 5 [cubits] and was recessed a  cubit was not [measured] with a cubit of five [handbreadths]. <b> one span to its edge</b>  The horns, both in their breadth and in their height, were [measured] with a cubit  of five [handbreadths].  <b> 14</b>   And from the base on the ground [Heb.  ומחיק הארץ . From the yesod, from the floor of the  earth. <b> to the lower ledge</b>  [Heb.  העזרה , lit. court.] Until the top of the first frame. <b> two cubits</b>  It was not  the same in the [Second] Temple, for there, we learned (Zeb. 54a): They bring a frame of 32 [cubits]  by 32 [cubits], whose height is a cubit, whereas here its height is two cubits. <b> cubit</b>  when one places the second frame upon it. The second frame was thirty by thirty, the result  being that it [the bottom, 32 by 32 cubit frame] had a recess around it a cubit wide which was the  base. Jonathan renders:  עזרה  as  מסתמתא , a word for floor, [and it was called so] because one would fill  the frame with smooth stones, pitch, lime, and molten lead, mix it and pour it out and smooth it out on  top, and behold, it would be a kind of floor. <b> cubits</b>  From the top of the lower frame until the top of the frame that was upon it was a height of four  cubits. <b> and the breadth, one cubit</b>  This is the amount of the recess of the circuit. It went up four  cubits and went in one cubit. [In the second Temple, it went up five cubits and went in one.] And this  is the circuit. The lower one is called smaller because it is only two [cubits] high, whereas the upper  one is four.  <b> 15</b>  <b> And the altar hearth</b>  The height of the top of the altar, from the circuit and above; and in the  [Second] Temple it was only three [cubits]. Jonathan, too, renders: And the altar was four cubits.  <b> 16</b>  <b> And the altar hearth shall be twelve [cubits in] length</b>  The [entire] place for the woodpile was  twenty-four [cubits] by twenty-four [cubits] and this [section] was twelve by twelve. <b> four sides</b>  [i.e.,] he measured twelve [cubits] from its center to every side. Behold [it was] 24 [cubits]  by 24 [cubits]. So is it clear from Zebahim (61b), and so have we learned in Tractate Middoth (3:1):  The altar [of the second Temple] was 32 by 32 [cubits]. It extended upward a cubit and receded a  cubitforming the baseleaving it 30 by 30 [cubits]. It extended upward five [cubits] and receded a  cubitthis is the circuitleaving 28 by 28 [cubits]. The area for the horns was a cubit here and a cubit  there, leaving 26 by 26 [cubits]. The area for the priests to walk was a cubit here and a cubit there,  leaving 24 by 24 [cubits]the place for the woodpiles.  <b> 17</b>  <b> And the ledge, fourteen [cubits in] length</b>  The top of the altar, including the area for the horns  and including the area for the feet of the priests, was 28 by 28 [cubits], and the 14 mentioned here  were measured from its center, as is explained by to its four sides. <b> and the boundary around it </b> Jonathan renders: and the rim, but our Sages explained it as referring to the horns. <b> half a cubit</b>  He  measures from its center; hence it was a cubit by a cubit. <b> and its base a cubit</b>  This is the recession of  the base. <b> and its ascents will look towards the east</b>  The ramp upon which they ascended was in the  south in order that the one who ascended it would face east, for all the [priests] turns were made  toward the right, and when you place the ramp in the south, the one who ascends it and turns right  faces east.  <b> 19</b>  <b> the priests, the Levites</b>  [i.e.,] who are of the tribe of Levi. <b> who are of the seed of Zadok</b>  Since he  was the High Priest who was the first to serve in the Temple, in the days of Solomon, they are [all]  called by his name.  <b> 20</b>  <b> on its four horns</b>  [i.e., the four horns] of the altar. <b> corners of the uppermost ledge</b>  the top of the  altar. <b> and make it fit for atonement</b>  You shall wipe it of its ordinariness to initiate it into sanctity,  so that it will befit for [providing] atonement from then on.  <b> 21</b>  <b> at the end of the House</b>  [Heb.  במפקד .] Jonathan renders: in a place where he sees the House, i.e.,  in a holy place.  במפקד הבית  means a place where the House terminates, as in (Num. 32:49): and not  one man of us is terminated  (נפקד) . This [bull] is the bull of investiture, [used] in the manner that  they [used it] in the Tabernacle, and that bull was burnt and not eaten. And our Sages expounded so in  Menahoth (45a): They sacrificed investiture offerings in Ezras days just as they sacrificed in  Moses days.  <b> 22</b>  <b> you shall offer a he-goat</b>  This was not [done] in the Tabernacle [of Moses time], but the  investiture of the future will be [done] so by Divine ordinance.  <b> 23</b>   the purification [Heb.  מחטא ,] from purifying.  <b> 25</b>  <b> without blemish shall they make</b>  (the burnt offering).  <b> 27</b>   and I will accept you with satisfaction [Heb.  ורצאתי ,] from  רצון  will.   <b> Chapter 44</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> shall be closed</b>  Our Rabbis interpreted this verse as referring to the southern wicket, for the gate of  the Heichal had a wicket, a small entrance. So we learned in Tractate Middoth (4:2): The Great Gate  had two wickets, one in the south and one in the north. No one ever entered the one in the south, of  which Ezekiel says, This gate shall be closed. <b> comes through it</b>  in the future.  <b> 3</b>  <b> The prince [I permit]; he is a prince, etc.</b>  The prince I give permission. He is a prince, and is  esteemed, and it is not fitting for him to sit and eat with the rest of the priests in the chambers. <b> sit therein</b>  in its space. <b> by way of the hall of the gate he shall come</b>  When he enters the Inner Court  in order to enter this small gate to eat therein, he shall enter by way of the hall of the Courts eastern  gate and leave the same way. Now since it states below (46:9), concerning: But when the people of  the land come before the Lord on the Festivals, he who enters by way of, etc. Scripture commanded  making the Court a shortcut since that entry was [made] for the sake of appearing [before God]. He  must therefore be well seen [i.e., throughout the entire Court]. It was necessary to specify here  concerning visits during the rest of the year that he should not make it a shortcut because this visit is  not for the sake of appearing, as is that of the Pilgrimage Festivals. This matter is corroborated many  more times in this account. <b> The prince</b>  The High Priest is a prince, and because of his importance he  will be permitted to eat the meat and bread of hallowed status in that gate, which is opened for him at  the time of his eating. <b> by way of the hall of the gate he shall come</b>  By way of the hall of the Eastern  Gate he shall enter the Court and come up to that wicket to eat his bread therein. <b> way he shall leave</b>  For this is not fit for a shortcut, as are the rest of the gates. Throughout the day,  when not during the time of the princes eating, it shall be closed.  <b> 7</b>  <b> aliens</b>  [lit. sons of an alien.] [Sons of] one whose deeds have become alienated from his Father in  Heaven; this is an apostate who worships idols. They are the ones of uncircumcised heart. <b> uncircumcised flesh</b>  [a] priest whose brothers died because of circumcision.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And you appointed keepers of My watch in My Sanctuary</b>  You knowingly appointed in My  Sanctuary, people who are not fit to be keepers of My watch.  <b> 10</b>  <b> Only the Levites who distanced themselves</b>  Only thus shall you do to the Levites who distanced  [themselves] from Me and became idolatrous priests and have now repented... <b> their iniquity</b>  from ever approaching My altar again, but they may be appointed to the gates of the  House (comandises in Old French, orders). They shall be watchmen and gatekeepers.  <b> 11</b>  <b> they shall slaughter the burnt offering</b>  a service that is valid [if performed] by non priests, slaves,  or women.  <b> 12</b>  <b> as a stumbling block of iniquity</b>  priests of idolatry, attracting them to it.  <b> 15</b>  <b> But the priests, the Levites</b>  [i.e., the priests, who are] of the tribe of Levi. <b> the sons of Zadok </b> Since he was the High Priest who served as the first one in the Sanctuary of Solomons days, they are  called by his name. <b> when...went astray</b>  [Heb.  בתעות ,] quand ils erraient, in Fr., when they strayed.  <b> 17</b>  <b> when they enter the gates of the Inner Court</b>  the Inner Sanctum on the Day of Atonement. <b> no wool shall be upon them</b>  They shall not wear the blue wool that was in the robe and girdle on the  Day of Atonement during the service in the Inner Court.  <b> 18</b>  <b> they shall not gird themselves in a place that sweats</b>  We learned in a baraitha (Zeb. 18b, 19a):  They do not gird themselves in a place where they sweat, neither above their elbows nor below their  loins, which is a place of sweat, en la suor in O.F., on (whatever causes) sweat. Another explanation:  The Torah prohibited the priests from wearing woolen raiment because wool causes the body to sweat  (not found in some editions). <b> hats</b>  [Heb.  פארי .] c(h)apelas in O.F., hats, head dress.  <b> 19</b>  <b> into the Outer Court, into the Outer Court</b>  Since he was speaking of the Heichal and the Inner  Sanctum, and he called them the Inner Court, and in relation to them, he should call the  Israelites Court an Outer Court, he therefore had to double it twice to say that he is speaking of the  Mens Court, the area that all Israel enter. <b> and place them in chambers belonging to the Sanctuary </b> as stated by our master Moses, may he rest in peace (Lev. 16:23): after that, he shall take off the  linen garments which he had put on, etc., and he shall leave them there. <b> the people</b>  [Heb.  ולא יקדשו אתהעם , lit. they shall not sanctify the people.] Jonathan renders: and they  shall not mingle with the people in their garments, [i.e.,] they shall not touch the people with their holy  garments, for ordinary garments are not ritually clean as regards [contaminating] holy garments.  <b> 20</b>  <b> And [the hair of] their heads they are not to shave</b>  to remove all the hair. <b> grow wild</b>  They may not let their hair grow very long. <b> they must be careful to trim</b>  [Heb.  כסום  יכסמו , (to cut the hair so that it appears)] like spelt  (כסמת) , which is arranged on the ear [with] the  end of one beside the root of another. So I heard in the name of Rabbi Menahem of blessed memory.  It is possible to explain it as an expression for a measure of a medium thing, neither shearing [all the  hair of] the head nor letting the hair grow long, but a medium amount, amo(d)ler in O.F., to cut to  medium length.  <b> 21</b>  <b> when they come into the Inner Court</b>  to the Heichal.  <b> 22</b>  <b> but...virgins</b>  may the High Priests take. But there are some priests who may take a widow, namely,  the ordinary ones, and this is the meaning of some of the priests may marry; there are some priests  who are permitted to marry a widow. <b> who is only a widow</b>  A real [widow], excluding a divorcee and a  woman upon whom the rite of chalitzah was performed; although she is unmarried, she is forbidden  even for an ordinary [priest].  <b> 26</b>  <b> And after his purification</b>  and after he has separated from the corpse. So was it taught in Moed  Katan (15b).  <b> 27</b>  <b> And on the day that he enters</b>  into the Sanctuary for the first time to initiate himself into the  service, he shall offer up his sin-offering; this is his one tenth of an ephah [of flour]. In Moed Katan  (16a) the following is taught: the regular priest requires one tenth of an ephah on the day of his  initiation, as it is stated (Lev. 6:13): This is the offering of Aaron and his sons, etc. and as is  explained in Tractate Menachoth (51b).  <b> 28</b>  <b> It shall be to them</b>  the priesthood, for an inheritance.  <b> 29</b>   and everything that is holy [Heb.  חרם ,] an expression of sanctity, and so is every expression  of  חרם  [when used] in the context of hallowed things.  <b> 30</b>  <b> to bring enduring blessings into your home</b>  [Heb.  להניח ,] aposer on O.F., (to cause) to rest,  settle, as in (Exod. 10:14): and it rested  (וינח)  throughout all the borders of Egypt.  <b> 31</b>  <b> Anything that has died of itself or is fatally wounded, etc.</b>  Since nipping the neck of the bird sin-  offering was permitted, which is [tantamount to] an animal that died of itself or was fatally wounded  [since it is not the normal method of slaughter], he had to warn them concerning [eating] other  creatures that died of themselves or were fatally wounded. So our Sages explain.   <b> Chapter 45</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> And when you divide the land by lot</b>  For they are destined to divide the land of Israel into twelve  strips, not like the original division, in which the large [tribe] had [land] according to its number and  the small [tribe] according to its number, and there were two or three tribes on one strip. Now the  portions are equal and they are like rows in a vineyard, from the western side to the eastern side, as  delineated at the end of the Book. <b> an offering to the Lord</b>  in which to build this Temple.  <b> 2</b>  <b> From this shall be</b>  From this offering, there shall be for the needs of the Sanctuary: five hundred  rods for the Temple Mount and the rest shall be for houses for the priests, as is delineated at the end of  the Book.  <b> 3</b>  <b> And with this measurement</b>  [lit. from this measurement.] With the measuring rod by which the 500  by 500 square of the Temple Mount was measured, as is stated above (42:20): To four sides he  measured it; its wall all around, five hundred rods, etc. <b> you shall measure the length</b>  of 25,000 rods  and the width of 10,000 rods. Because he did not explain in the first verse what the 25,000 are,  whether rods or cubits, he had to say, concerning the 25,000 measures that they were measured with  the measuring rod by which the five hundred by five hundred of the Temple Mount were measured.  <b> 4</b>  <b> It is the holy portion of the land</b>  Rearrange the verse: The remainder of the holy portion, which is  from that land, shall be for the priests, the ministers of the Sanctuary, who come near, etc. The holy  portion of the land is this offering. <b> for the priests, the ministers of the Sanctuary</b>  The remainder  over the 500 of the Temple Mount; 12,250 to the east and correspondingly to the westthe Sanctuary  [being] in the center 4,750 to the north, and correspondingly to the south. <b> place for houses</b>  this remainder, which surrounds the Sanctuary. <b> the Sanctuary</b>  And the middle five hundred by five hundred shall be hallowed for the Sanctuary, e  sentije al sentuere in O. F., and consecrated for the Sanctuary.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And twenty-five thousand</b>  rods in length, and ten thousand in width, you shall separate as another  strip beside this one, south of this one, for the Levites. It is explained at the end of the Book that it is  in the south. Twenty chambers shall be for the Levites in the perimeter of the Sanctuary in order to  guard the House and to provide beauty, and the remainder of the strip shall be used for their own  needs.  <b> 6</b>  <b> And, [for] the property of the city</b>  The environs of the city; its properties meant for ordinary  dwelling, in which the Israelites may build houses. <b> you shall give a width of five thousand</b>  in the  south of the second one, and a length equal to the measurement of the two strips. It is found that the  entire offering is square, twenty-five [thousand] by twenty-five thousand. <b> offering of the holy portion</b>  in the measurement of the length of the strips of the offering of the holy  portion. <b> for the entire House of Israel it shall be</b>  That third strip shall be the dwelling place for non  priests.  <b> 7</b>  <b> city</b>  At the end of the section, he divides the land of Israel from east to west into thirteen strips: twelve  as the number of the tribes each one twenty-five thousand rods wide, and its length equaling the length  of all the land of Israel and one strip as an offering whose length is from the eastern border to the  western border, and whose width is twenty-five thousand rods, just as each of the other portions. And  from that strip he separated in its center the three strips stated above, which [all together] are twenty-  five thousand by twenty-five thousand. And the remainder to the east until the end of the border of the  land, and to the west, as well, shall be for the prince from either side to the east and to the west. <b> alongside the offering of the holy portion and alongside the possession of the city</b>  opposite the  entire breadth of the three strips separated for the offering of the holy portionof the strips of the  priests, the Levites, and the property of the city. <b> from the western side, westward</b>  from the west of  the offering of the holy portion and the city until the west of the boundary. <b> east ward</b>  And from the east of the offering to the eastern boundary, opposite one of the portions of  the tribes delineated at the end of the Book, which are from the western boundary of the land of Israel,  until the eastern boundary.  <b> 8</b>  <b> In the land he shall have it for a possession</b>  [Heb.  לארץ  Jonathan renders: This land shall be for the  prince as a possession. <b> shall no longer defraud</b>  [Heb.  יונו ,] an expression for monetary fraud; they  take away their inheritance forcibly for they rob their inherited property  <b> 9</b>  <b> take away your evictions</b>  Take away [your practice] of evicting My people from their inherited  property.  <b> 10</b>  <b> ephah</b>  of the dry measure. <b> bath</b>  of the liquid measure.  <b> 11</b>  <b> one volume</b>  [Heb.  תכן ,] a word denoting number, like (Exod. 5:18): and a quota  (ותכן)  of bricks  you must deliver. One measure is equivalent to one tenth of a homer of dry measure, which equals  thirty seah, and which is a tenth of a homer of liquid measure. Ephah and bath are words for  [units of] measurement. <b> the homer</b>  [A measure known further as]  kor, moy(d) or muy(d) in Old  French, a measure. <b> shall contain</b>  [Heb.  לשאת ,] similar to  לקחת , to take, and so too did Jonathan render  it:  למיסב . A tenth part of a homer shall be a bath, and a tenth part of the dry homer, shall be  an ephah. <b> according to the homer shall be its volume</b>  The total amount of [the volume of]  the bath and the ephah shall be according to the size of the homer.  <b> 12</b>  <b> And the shekel is twenty gerah</b>  Twenty maah. <b> fifteen shekels</b>  totaling sixty shekels. <b> shall the maneh be to you</b>  Le zent in O. F., the 100 (zuz  weight). Menahem, however, connected it to the word  מנין , a number (p. 118). We have here  240 zuz, [four zuz to a shekel]. From here we derive that the maneh of the Sanctuary was double,  and they added a sixth to it in Ezekiels time, totaling 240 [zuz] (Men. 77a). When Scripture divided it  into three parts and did not write simply, sixty shekels shall the maneh be for you, it commanded to  make from it a weight one third of it, and a weight equaling a fourth of it, and a weight of the  ordinary maneh as it was originally. So too did Jonathan paraphrase: a third of the maneh shall be  twenty selaim of silver; a maneh of silvertwenty-five selaim; a fourth of  a manehfifteen selaim; altogether, sixty selaim; and the great maneh of the Sanctuary shall  be for you.  <b> 13</b>  <b> a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat</b>  This amounts to one out of sixty. Whoever wishes to  give little shall not give less than this, and this is what they said (Ter. 4:3): A stingy person gives one  out of sixty. <b> and you shall separate a sixth</b>  And you shall separate a sixth of an ephah for  the terumah of a homer of barley.  <b> 14</b>  <b> And the rule of the oil</b>  regarding tithes. <b> the bath, [which is a measure of] oil, etc. </b> The bath, which is a measure of oilthis is its tithe: the bath will be from a kor. I found [the  following]: The tenth that the bath represents as a tithe shall be from a kor. How so? The tithe of  a bath is from a kor. Dix measures in French, ten measures. This word is used for itself and for  others, like (Num. 7:9): the service of the Sanctuary, (ibid. 4:33): the service of [the families of] the  sons of Merari. <b> ten baths</b>  shall equal a homer for you. Then it will be possible to take from it  one bath as a tithe. <b> for ten baths are a homer</b>  because the homer will consist of ten baths for  you. So too did Jonathan render it: one out of ten is the bath in relation to the kor for  ten baths are a kor.  <b> 15</b>  <b> And one lamb from the flocks</b>  A special one of his flocks, and so too said Moses (Deut. 12:  11): and all the choice of your pledges, le meilleur in Fr., the best. <b> banquet</b>  Our Rabbis expounded (Pes. 48a) this as regarding libations [coming] from a multiplicity of  two hundred [times as much of the original wine] as remained in the pit after the wine of orlah or  of mingled species in the vineyard fell into it. From here it is derived that orlah and mingled  species in the vineyard are nullified in two hundred [times as much]. <b> from Israels banquet</b>  from  what is permissible for Israel. All your sacrifices shall be drink that is fit for Israel. The main part of  the feast is called by the name of the drink; i.e., the food and also the drink shall be from that which is  permitted for Israel.  <b> 16</b>  <b> to give this oblation</b>  mentioned above; it will be [given] with the knowledge of all the people of  the land.  <b> 17</b>  <b> on the prince</b>  I say that this prince as well as every [mention of] the prince in this section  means the High Priest; but I heard in the name of Rabbi Menahem that it means the king.  <b> 18</b>  <b> [and] without blemish</b>  This is the bull of investiture mentioned at the beginning of this section (43:18  27), and he teaches [us] here that the investiture should be on the first of Nissan. <b> and you shall purify </b> [as translated,] and you shall purify.  <b> 20</b>  <b> And so shall you do on seven [days] in the month</b>  It may be said that [this means]: And so shall  you do all seven, and so too he says above (43:26): For seven days they shall effect atonement for  the altar. But our Rabbis explained it in Menahoth (45a) in the following manner: And so shall you  make [as a sacrifice] a bull that is not to be eaten in [the event of] seven tribes who interpreted the  Torah in a new way  (שחדשו)   and whose tribunal issued a decision that fat is permissible, and seven  tribes, (which are the majority of the nation), who acted on their word. They must bring a bull for  communal error. <b> because of mistaken and simple-minded men</b>  This is a transposed verse: And you  shall expiate the House from mistaken and simple-minded men. After the seven days of investiture,  whenceforth the altar will be dedicated, they shall bring their sin-offerings and their guilt-offerings,  and they will attain atonement, for at the time that Israel attains atonement, the House attains  atonement.  <b> 21</b>  <b> seven days</b>  [Lit. weeks of days,] because they commence from it to count seven weeks. <b> unleavened bread shall be eaten</b>  and unleavened bread shall be eaten on that festival.  <b> 22</b>  <b> And the prince shall make on that day, etc.</b>  Our Rabbis (Hag. 13a) said that they sought to  suppress the Book of Ezekiel for his words contradicted the words of the Torah. Indeed, Hananiah the  son of Hezekiah the son of Gurion is remembered for good, for he sat in his attic and expounded on it.  But because of our iniquities, what he expounded on these sacrificeswhy a bull is brought on the  fourteenth day of Nissanhas been lost to us. I say that perhaps he is dealing with the fourteenth of  Nissan of the first Passover in which the fully erected House will be dedicated, and this bull will be  brought in lieu of the calf born of cattle that Aaron offered up on the eighth of investiture (Lev. 9:2).  [Scripture] tells us that if he will not have offered it up on the eighth day of investiture, he should offer  it up on the fourteenth of Nissan in order that he should be initiated for the service before the Festival,  for it is incumbent upon him [to bring] the sacrifices and the burnt offering of the appointed time, as is  stated above (v. 17): And the burnt offerings and the meal-offerings and the libations on the  festivals...shall devolve on the prince, etc.  <b> 23</b>  <b> seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily</b>  But the Torah states (Num. 28:19): two  young bulls, one ram. We can explain this verse only as meaning seven bulls and seven rams for the  seven days, a bull daily and a ram daily, and it comes to teach us that the bulls do not render each  other invalid and the rams do not render each other invalid. [I.e., if one bull is missing, the other one  may be brought.] So we learned in Menahoth (45a); however, they did not bring proof from this verse  but from the verse below (46:6): But on the New Moon: a young bull from those without blemish,  and six lambs and a ram. But perhaps this too comes to teach the same thing, and this is its meaning:  seven bulls and seven rams daily. By adding the sacrifices of each day on its day, they add up to seven  bulls for the seven days. <b> and a sin-offering, a he-goat daily</b>  the he-goats of the pilgrimage festivals.  <b> 24</b>  <b> And a meal-offering...an ephah for a bull</b>  the meal-offering of the libations, an ephah for a  bull. Now I do not know what this means, for the Torah stated (28:20): three tenths for the bull. It is  possible that it means an ephah of flour from which we extract a tenth of fine flour from a seah,  for the ephah is three seahs. <b> and an ephah for a ram</b>  This too is flour from which we extract  two tenths of fine flour sifted thoroughly, as we learned (Men. 6:6): The two loaves were two tenths  from three seahs. [The requirement of] an ephah for the bull teaches that if he did not find fine  sifted flour that yielded that much, he may bring from [flour that yields] a tenth to a seah. <b> each ephah one hin of oil</b>  I do not know why. We may say that it does not mean that he must  sacrifice the entire hin, but that there were notches in the hin and he would sacrifice oil according  to the fine flour, according to the sacrificial laws for a bull according to its requirement and for a ram  according to its requirement, according to the notches of the hin.   <b> Chapter 46</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> The gate of the Inner Court that faces toward the east, etc.</b>  Our Rabbis learned in Tractate  Middoth (4:2): The gate of the Heichal had two wickets, one in the south and one in the north.  Concerning the one in the south it is explained in the post Mosaic Scriptures (above 44:2): and no  man shall come through it...and it shall be closed.  <b> 2</b>  <b> by way of the vestibule of the gate without</b>  as he states above (40:31): And its halls were to the  Outer Court. By way of the vestibule of the Gate of the Court, i.e., he shall enter by way of the  Eastern Gate, which serves for entry and exit, and come to that wicket. <b> doorpost of the gate</b>  That small gate is the wicket. <b> his burnt offering and his peace offering</b>  The  burnt offering for appearing in the Temple and the peace offering for celebrating the festivals; this  verse refers to the festivals. <b> and he shall stand at the doorposts of the gate</b>  The inner gate; this is the  wicket, as the master stated (Taanith 4:2): Is it possible for a persons sacrifice to be offered up when  he is not standing over it? <b> shall not be closed until the evening</b>  Now why should it not be closed ?  <b> 3</b>  <b> And the people of the land shall prostrate themselves</b>  all day, and whoever comes, too, and in the  evening they shall close it.  <b> 4</b>  <b> On the Sabbath day shall be six lambs</b>  I do not know why, for the Torah said (Num. 28:9): two  lambs, and on the Sabbath Day means either the Sabbath commemorating the Creation or a  festival. I, therefore, say that this Sabbath is not the Sabbath commemorating the Creation, but a  festival that requires seven lambs and two rams. Scripture comes and teaches you that [the absence of  one] does not render the other one invalid, and if he does not find seven, he should bring six, and if he  does not find two rams, he should bring one, as our Rabbis expounded regarding the New Moon.  <b> 5</b>  <b> as he is able to give</b>  This teaches that the meal-offerings do not render each other invalid [in each  others absence].  <b> 6</b>  <b> But on the New Moon: a young bull without blemish</b>  Our Rabbis expounded upon this verse in  Menahoth (45a): Why does it say, a young bull? Since it is stated in the Torah (Num. 28:11): And  at the beginnings of your months, etc., two young bulls, how do you know that if he did not find two,  he should bring one? Because it is stated: a bull. <b> and six lambs</b>  Why is it necessary to state this?  Since it is said in the Torah, seven, how do you know that if he did not find seven, he should bring  six? Because it is stated: and six lambs. And how do you know [that he should bring] even one?  Because the Torah says, but for the lambs as much as he can afford.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And whenever the prince goes in</b>  on the New Moon and on the Sabbath of Creation, when Israel is  not commanded to appear at the Temple, and he comes in to prostrate himself. <b> of the vestibule of the gate, and by the same way shall he go out</b>  Through the very same gate he  shall go out, and he is not commanded to make the Court a short-cut. But on the festivals, concerning  which it is stated (Deut. 16:16): shall all your males appear, he is required to make it a short-cut like  the rest of the people. That is what is written (verse 10): goes in among them when they go in, and  when they go out, they [the prince and people together] go out.  <b> 9</b>  <b> that which is opposite it</b>  It is incumbent upon them to be seen in full view in the Court.  <b> 10</b>  <b> The prince</b>  When he enters the Temple Court through the southern wicket of the Heichal to  prostrate himself, he too must make the Temple Court a short-cut. He shall enter by way of the  northern gate and leave by way of the southern gate with the rest of the people of the land. This is the  meaning of enters in their midst when they go in, and when they go out, they go outall of them, the  prince with the rest of the people. And he shall not enter by way of the eastern gate as he regularly  does on the New Moon and on the Sabbath of Creation, for the eastern gate has no gate opposite it in  the west.  <b> 12</b>  <b> And when the prince brings a freewill offering</b>  on the six working days. <b> him the gate, etc.</b>  Not to enter the Heichal through it, but he shall stand there, and the priests shall  make his burnt offering and his peace-offering, and he shall prostrate himself and leave, as it is  said: as he would do on the Sabbath day. Now what is stated regarding the Sabbath day (here)?  (Verse 2) And he shall stand at the doorpost of the gate, and the priests shall offer his burnt offering,  etc. <b> after he has gone out</b>  He does not say here: but the gate shall not be closed until the  evening, as he says regarding the Sabbath day. For regarding the Sabbath day it says (verse 3): And  the people of the land shall prostrate themselves at the entrance of that gate. Therefore, it is left open.  But on weekdays it is not customary for them to come to prostrate themselves, for everyone is  occupied with work; therefore, after he has gone out, one shall close the gate.  <b> 13</b>  <b> And a lamb of the first year</b>  the daily sacrifice.  <b> 14</b>  <b> a sixth of an ephah</b>  of the [post-Exodus] Jerusalemite measure, which is a fifth of the  [Mosaic] measure of the desert, equaling two tenth parts, one for the daily meal-offering and one for  the pancakes. And although the pancakes were offered up by halves, he brings a complete tenth part in  the morning and divides it in half, as we learned in Menahoth (4:5) <b> to stir [with] the fine flour</b>  [Heb.  לרם ,] asperger in French, to moisten, besprinkle.

Below the row [of masonry] was a space in  which to kindle a fire and the pots [would be heated] above it. <b> and a place for cooking was made </b> that is the space below the placing of the pots.  <b> 24</b>  <b> the peoples sacrifices</b>  The breast and the thigh of the peace offering, which do not become unfit  by going out of the Israelites Court as do the sin-offering and the guilt-offering.   <b> Chapter 47</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Then he brought me back</b>  into the Inner Court. To the entrance of the House. And the water was  descending from under the right side of the House, flowing from under the threshold, which was in the  center of the east[ern side] and [going] diagonally toward the right, and going out of the Court at the  south of the altar, and proceeding out of the city. In Tractate Yoma we learned (77b): Said Rabbi  Phinehas in the name of Rab Huna of Sepphoris: The fountain emanating from the Holy of Holies at  first resembles the points of rocks. As soon as it reaches the entrance of the Hall, it becomes like a  woof thread. When it reaches the entrance of the Heichal, it becomes like a warp thread. When it  reaches the entrance of the Court, it becomes like the mouth of a small jug.  <b> 2</b>  <b> And he took me out</b>  of the Inner Court to the Outer Court through the northern gate. <b> around</b>  around the inner wall within the outer one. <b> to the...Gate</b>  The outer [gate] that faces eastward. <b> water was trickling</b>  [Heb.  מפכים ,] buient in O.F., dripping, trickling, as wide as the width of the  mouth of a jug. So did our Sages explain it, as above.  <b> 3</b>  <b> he measured one thousand cubits</b>  outside the wall. For those thousand cubits, the stream did not  swell to the extent of being deep up to the  אפסים  ; the ankles, called chevilles in Fr.  <b> 4</b>  <b> And he measured one thousand</b>  another [one thousand cubits], and they deepened up to the knees,  and another thousand, and they deepened up to the loins. From here on, it was a stream that I could  not cross. From here we learn that one should not enter water from the loins and higher, lest the water  over power him. As soon as he came to the water reaching the loins, he went out upon the bank of the  river and measured another thousand before him, a stream that cannot be crossed, and his feet were  standing on dry land. This is what is written (v. 6): and he brought me back [upon] the bank of the  stream, i.e., near the bank of the stream that is where he had been standing.  <b> 5</b>  <b> for the water was so high</b>  [Heb.  גאו ,lit. became haughty,] like  גדלו , became large. <b> swimming</b>  [Heb.  שחו ,] noer in 0.F., to swim, water that one must swim in and not cross by foot lest it  overpower him.  שחו  means swimming, like (Isa. 25:11): as the swimmer spreads out [his hands] to  swim  השחה לשחות .  <b> 6</b>  <b> Have you seen, Son of man</b>  how much this stream has swelled?  <b> 7</b>  <b> and behold, upon the bank of the stream, etc.</b>  While he led me and brought me back, a very great  profusion of trees had grown on the banks of the stream on each side. <b> profusion of trees</b>  [Heb.  עץ ,]  abres; erbeiz in Old French, trees, vegetation.  <b> 8</b>  <b> to the...frontier</b>  [Heb.  הגלילה ,] la marche, frontier (province). <b> the eastern</b>  [Heb.  הקדומנה ,] the  eastern. Our Rabbis taught in the Tosefta of Succah (3:3): Where do they flow? To the Sea of Tiberias  (Kinnereth), the Sea of Sodom (Dead Sea), and to the Great Sea, to heal their salty waters and to  sweeten them. [Will descend upon the plain]this is the Sea of Tiberias. [And come to the sea]this  is the Sea of Sodom. <b> to the sea that is brought out</b>  This is the  אוקיינוס  ocean, which is brought out  from civilization to encompass the world. And [it will come] to heal the waters of their saltiness. The  Midrash Aggadah [says] Yerushalmi Shekalim (6:2): Why does he call them  המוצאים  (in the plural)?  Because of the two times that they went out.  <b> 9</b>  <b> wherever the two streams will go</b>  This stream, which divides into many streams, sweetens the seas  into which it mingles, and their fish, which swarm in them, are alive and sweet.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And it will be [a place] beside which fishermen will stand etc., nets</b>  [Heb.  לחרמים ,] for nets <b> their fish will be of many kinds</b>   למינה .] This does not have a mappik hey, and it means that its  fish will be of many kinds of many kinds. <b> of many kinds</b>  [Heb.  למינה ,] a form of the word to denote  a profusion of kinds, as in (Exod. 7:21): And the fish  והדגה  in the river; (Isa. 21:2): All sighs  (אנחתה)  have I brought to an end.  <b> 11</b>  <b> Its marshes</b>  [The marshes] of the sea, as in (Job 8:11): Can papyrus shoot up without a marsh  (בצה)  ? This is maresc in Old French, a marsh. <b> and its pools</b>  [Heb.  וגבאיו ,] like (II Kings 3:  16): This valley will be full of pools. The  בצים  are the marshes around it, and the  גבים  are ditches  in which water is gathered. <b> will not be healed</b>  to be turned sweet. Why? Because they will be set  aside for salt [mines].  ולא ירפאו  This vav is subordinate and superfluous.  <b> 12</b>  <b> month after month its fruits will ripen</b>  From month to month its fruits will ripen. <b> for a cure</b>  [Heb.  לתרופה .] Our Sages of blessed memory explained: to unlock the mouth  (להתיר פה)  of the dumb and the  mouth [of the womb] of the barren (Men. 98a), but its apparent meaning is a word for healing, as in  (Jer. 6:14): And they healed  (וירפאו)  the breach of My people easily. And so did Menahem  connect it.  <b> 13</b>  <b> This is the border</b>  [Heb.  גה גבול .] Jonathan renders: This is the border, just like  זה גבול  ; and  so too (above 25:7): and I have given you for plunder  (לבג)  to the nations, is like  לבז . It may also  be interpreted as a form of the word for valley  (גיא) . <b> Joseph portions</b>  Joseph shall take two portions,  one for Manasseh and one for Ephraim.  <b> 14</b>  <b> as one another</b>  and not like the first one (Num. 26:54): to each according to his numbered  ones. Now, instead, all the tribes will be equal, and every portion will be like a row in a vineyard from  the eastern border until the ocean to the west, as is explained in the account, and no two tribes will be  in strip.  <b> 15</b>  <b> And this is the border of the land</b>  the boundaries of the Land of Israel. <b> to the northern side </b> [Heb.  לפאתצפונה ,] the northern direction. <b> from the Great Sea</b>  which is the western border. <b> to Hethlon</b>  It comes to the east to Hethlon, to Zedad, to Hamath, Berothah, and Sibraim. All these  cities are on the northern border.  <b> 16</b>  <b> Hazer-hatticon</b>  Jonathan renders: the pond of the Agebeans. <b> which is by the border of Hauran </b> The border of Damascus is in the east, near the corner.  <b> 17</b>  <b> And the border shall be from the sea to Hazer-enon</b>  The northern border shall be from the sea  until Hazer-enon. <b> the border of Damascus</b>  [i.e.,] which is on the border of Damascus, i.e., Hazer-enon  is on the northeastern corner, as is explicated in the [description of] the boundaries which Moses, our  master, may he rest in peace, wrote (Num. 34:9-10f.): and its ends shall be Hazer -as your eastern  border [the territory] from Hazer-enan, etc. The border of Damascus is in the northeastern corner  beside Hazer-enan, as is stated above: Hazer-enan and the border of Damascus. The border of  Hamath is at the northwestern corner, as is stated (ibid. v. 7f.): And this shall be your northern  border: from the Great Sea you shall draw a line extending to the road [leading] to Hamath, and from  there to Zedad. <b> and in the north northward is the border of Hamath</b>  i.e., the entire northern  border delineated in the Torah, and the border of Hamath-which is also on the northern border as is  stated (ibid. verse 7f.): And this shall be your northern border: from the Great Sea you shall draw a  line extending to Mount Hor. From Mount Hor you shall draw a line extending to the road [leading] to  Hamath, and the ends of the border shall be toward Zedad. That is the Zedad mentioned here: the  way to Hethlon to the road [leading] to Zedad. <b> this is the northern side</b>  [Lit. and the northern side.]  And here you have the northern side.  <b> 18</b>  <b> between Gilead and the land of Israel</b>  The eastern border of the land of Canaan. Trans-Jordan is  not included within these borders; only the land of Canaan. Similarly, the borders demarcated in the  Torah do not include Trans Jordan. And this is the meaning of this verse: And from the eastern border  of the land of Canaan, which is between Hauran and Damascus which are situated on its northeastern  corner, as is stated above in this section, and between Gilead and the land of Israel that is on the  eastern side of the Jordan. <b> is the Jordan; from the border by the eastern sea shall you measure </b> The Jordan is its eastern border from the boundary of the northern cornerthat is the Hazer-enan  delineated above, until the eastern sea, the Dead Sea, which is in the south-eastern corner. This shall  you measure as the length of the eastern border. In the Torah, too, the eastern boundary is delineated  in this manner (Num. 34:12): and its ends shall be the Salt Sea in the southern corner. <b> eastern side</b>  As if to say, [as translated,] this is the eastern side.  <b> 19</b>  <b> from Tamar</b>  From Jericho, which is the city of date palms, (Deut. 33:3), and so did Jonathan  render it. <b> until the water of Meriboth Kadesh</b>  that is the desert of Zin. (Num 27:14) <b> [that falls] into the Great Sea</b>  And from there the border proceeds until the stream of Egypt, which  falls into the Great Sea in the southwestern corner. Moses, too, delineated the southern boundary in  this way, from the desert of Zin alongside Edom, and he proceeds and counts until (ibid. 34:5): from  Atzmon to the stream of Egypt, and its ends shall be at the sea. [Accordingly,]  נחלה  stated here is like  לנחל , to the stream. I found it, however, translated [by Jonathan] as  אחסנא , an inheritance, and were it  not for the fact that the accent is on the last syllable, and [that] the Masorah states that there is no  other instance in which the accent is on the first syllable, I would have said that it is an error, and that  Jonathan did not translate it that way, only erring readers.  <b> 20</b>  <b> And the western side</b>  the western border. <b> road [leading] to Hamath</b>  from the southern corner, which is the stream of Egypt, until opposite the  way [leading] to Hamath, until the northwestern corner, which is Mount Hor, opposite the road  [leading] to Hamath, for Hamath is in the northwest corner alongside Mount Hor, as is written (Num.  34:7f.): From the Great Sea you shall draw a line extending to Mount Hor. From Mount Hor you shall  draw a line extending to the road [leading] to Hamath.  <b> 23</b>  <b> with which the stranger sojourns</b>  who became proselytized in exile within that tribe.   <b> Chapter 48</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> And these are the names of the tribes</b>  The arrangement of the portions they divide among  themselves; the place of each one. <b> From the northern end</b>  Dan will receive the northern border from  Hazer-enan, which is at the eastern corner, until the border of Damascus (in the northwestern corner). <b> and he shall have the eastern side to the sea</b>  i.e., from the eastern side until the sea, Dan [shall have]  one portion. Now, he delineated the length but not the width. In the Baraitha of Sifrei in the portion of  Haazinu (Deut. 32:12), [it says]: What is the reason for stating, Judah: one portion; Dan: one  portion; Asher: one portion? It is to teach us that Israel are destined to receive the length, from east to  west, measuring 25,000 rods in width, which equal 75 mil. Now from where did they learn this  measurement? From the offering, which is like one of these portions, as is explained above (45:1,6). I  found that the following is written: the length is like one of the portions, and it has a width of 25,000  rods, and a length, from the western side to the eastern side, of twenty-five thousand rods. [Now, 15,  000 rods] equal 150,000 cubits, for a rod equals six cubits, and every 2,000 cubits equals one mil as  we find in Tractate Yoma (67a) regarding the ten sukkot [booths] from Jerusalem to the precipice-  behold 150,000 cubits amount to 75 mils. This is what Rabbi Eliezer [Hakalir] established in the  liturgical poem, entitled When I take an appointed time (the last poem for the second day of  Succoth): At the time of the division of her lands, like a row of a vineyard abroad, in the length from  the eastern side to its ends, until the ocean are its commandments, with a width of seventy-five mils  are its limits. (Some editions read: Seventy-five mils to thirteen strips, between the strips of the tribes  and the strips of the Sanctuary will amount to 975 mils. Now, according to the figure of 400 parasangs  by 400 parasangs for the land of Israel, the mils amount to 1600 [not 975] according to the figuring of  the Kalir, who said that four mils equal a parasang. Perhaps the mils of the computation by strips are  larger, four of them not fitting into a parasang, and he therefore came to count two and a half mils to a  parasang, by which 400 parasangs will equal 1,000 mils. However, the computation of the mils of a  strip equal only 975 mils, still leaving the total 25 mils short. The sum of the liturgical poets mils of  strips does not equal the sum of four hundred parasangs. And whence did Rabbi Eliezer learn that the  length of the strips extended to the ocean, which is at the end of the world, whereas Scripture testifies  that the western border is [only] until the Great Sea [the Mediterranean], which is quite a distance  inland from the ocean?)  <b> 2</b>  <b> And alongside the border of Dan</b>  and alongside the border of Dan to its south.  <b> 8</b>  <b> shall be the offering etc.,</b>  Now, if you ask, how is it possible that Jerusalem should be in its place?  Was not Jerusalem on the northern border of Judah, which received the south of the land of Canaan?  And here it is in the middle of the tribes! [I will answer you that] this division is not like Joshuas  division, for this one is like the rows of a vineyard and all the portions are equal, whereas [in] Joshuas  division, the tribe of Judah had such a large portion that [its territory was] too much for it until Simeon  took part of it as is said (Josh. 19:9): Out of the lot of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the  children of Simeon. Therefore, the width of the portion that Judah received in the days of Joshua  suffices now for the five remaining tribes to take a share of it, because its length was very great, from  the eastern side to the ocean, and Jerusalem is located there. <b> and the Sanctuary shall be in its midst </b> as he proceeds to explain.  <b> 9</b>  <b> The offering that you shall separate for the Lord</b>  From this portion that was separated alongside  Judah on their south, whose length is from the east to the sea and whose width is 25,000 rodsfrom it  shall be the offering for the Lord for the Sanctuary and a place for houses for the priests, the length 25,  000 rods from east to west and the width 10,000 north to south.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And these shall be the offering of the Sanctuary for the priests</b>  [Heb.  ולאלה .] And these 10,000  in width and 25,000 in length shall be for the priests in the north in the midst of the strips of the great  offering alongside the south of Judah. <b> to the north 25,000</b>  That is the length from east to west. <b> the west the width is 10,000</b>  The western border is 10,000 wide from north to south. <b> the width is 10,000</b>  The eastern side is 10,000 from north to south. <b> 000</b>  from east to west. <b> and the Sanctuary of the Lord shall be in its midst</b>  This is the Temple Mount.  Five hundred rods by 500 rods shall be in the center of this strip, and all its surrounding area shall  belong to the priests: 12,250 to the east and likewise to the west and in the width, 4,750 to the north  and likewise to the south, as stated above (45:2) of this, there shall be for the Sanctuary five hundred  by five hundred, square.  <b> 11</b>  <b> The hallowed part shall be for the priests</b>  This part, which is hallowed, shall be for the priests.  <b> 12</b>  <b> separated</b>  [Heb.  תרומיה ,] separated.  תרומה  is the noun, separation.  תרומיה  means separated.  And this strip shall be separated for them, from the offering of the land, from the great separation that  was separated from the land, whose length is from the ocean to the eastern border by the width of 25,  000, as is stated above. From it, they shall set apart this strip, at the middle of its length, for the priests  and for the Sanctuary. <b> holy of holies</b>  for the entire great separation is holy for the priests, the Levites,  the prince, the possession of the city, and those who serve the city, as he proceeds to explain. This 25,  000 in length and 10,000 in width in its north which is separated from it [the total holy area] shall  be holy of holies for the priests and the Sanctuary. <b> alongside the border of the Levites</b>  [Heb.  אל-  גבול הלוים , lit., to the border of the Levites,] alongside the strips of the Levites.  <b> 13</b>  <b> And the Levites: opposite the border of the priests</b>  Alongside the strips of the priests, like the  measurement of the priests, parallel to its entire length. <b> every length</b>  The length of all the strips is 25,  000.  <b> 14</b>  <b> or exchange</b>  And he shall not exchange it for any other land.  <b> 15</b>  <b> And the 5,000 that remain in the width</b>  of the strips of the great separation which was 25,000 [in]  width and its length was the same as that of any portions from the eastern side to the western side.  From that he set apart two strips from its center, 25,000 long and 20,000 wide; and 5,000 were left  over in its width. Those 5,000 of the width shall be for the residential area of the city, their length  facing the 25,000 length of the offering for the Levites. <b> is non-holy</b>  [These 5,000 rods of land] are not  holy like the offering of the strips of the priests and the Levites. It is non-holy as compared to them,  and they shall be for the city for dwellings of Israelites and for an open space around the city. <b> midst</b>  in the middle of that strip.  <b> 16</b>  <b> And these are its measurements</b>  [i.e., the measurements] of the city. <b> The north side, etc.</b>  4,500  rods by 4,500 rods square. Five hundred remain in the width, which will provide them with an open  space, 250 to the north and 250 rods to the south, as is stated in the following verse, and likewise to  the east and west. Thus we have 5,000 by 5,000 in the middle of the strip, thereby filling its entire  width. In the length of this third strip, 10,000 are left to the east and 10,000 are left to the west.  Concerning them, Scripture states (verse 18): And the remainder in length, opposite the offering of  the Sanctuary: 10,000 to the east and 10,000 to the west.  <b> 17</b>  <b> The city shall have an open space</b>  All the migrashim of the cities in Scripture are an open space  with neither houses or fields.  <b> 18</b>  <b> and its grain shall be for food for those who serve the city</b>  These are the Gibeonites, who were  made wood-cutters and water-drawers (Josh. 9:27). So I heard in the name of Rabbi Menahem of  blessed memory.  לעובדי העיר , as servants in Old French: to the workers.  <b> 19</b>  <b> of all the tribes of Israel shall serve him</b>  for they gave them this as a portion of the land.  <b> 20</b>  <b> The entire offering</b>  that is hallowed, that is separated from the great separation, amounts to 25,000  by 25,000 rods. <b> a square</b>  [Heb.  רביעית ,] a square, alongside the offering for the Sanctuary, for the  priests and the Levites, and the possession of the city. <b> the possession</b>  [Heb.  אחזת ,] porpris in Old  French; precincts.  <b> 21</b>  <b> And the remainder shall be for the prince, etc.</b>  and the remainder of the length of the great  separation. <b> on either side</b>  to the east and to the west of the offering of the Sanctuary and the  possession of the city. <b> alongside 25,000 of the offering</b>  alongside the 25,000 width of the offering  extending to the eastern border of the entire land of Israel. <b> and to the west, alongside, etc.</b>  and  likewise to the west, facing the three strips of the priests, the Levites, and the citys possession, in the  width of 25,000. <b> the western border</b>  [Heb.  על-גבול ימה ,] like  עד גבול ימה , until the ocean. <b> opposite the portions</b>  opposite the length of the tribes portions. <b> shall belong to the prince</b>  [lit. to  the prince,] it shall be. <b> and the offering of the Sanctuary...shall be</b>  i.e., the strip of the priests. <b> the Sanctuary of the House shall be in its midst</b>  Everything is in the middle of the inheritance of the  prince.  <b> 22</b>  <b> Both the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city</b>  That, too, shall be in the midst  of what belongs to the prince. <b> between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin</b>  The entire  width of the strip that is between these two tribes, Judah on the north and Benjamin on the south, shall  belong to the prince, and that is the strip that was separated first, a width of 25,000, with a length [that  follows] the portions of the tribes.  <b> 23</b>  <b> And the rest of the tribes</b>  shall receive [portions] south of that strip, Benjamin alongside it, and  beside him Simeon, beside him Issachar, beside him Zebulun, and beside him Gad.

Rabbah 56:16). It may also be interpreted: and the name of the city in  the future, from when it is built and thenceforth, shall be The Lord is There.
