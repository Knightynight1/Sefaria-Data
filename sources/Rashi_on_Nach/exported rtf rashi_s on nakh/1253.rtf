\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ were not on guard against him. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And he put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ swords, and he went out to meet Amasa. He turned the opening downward so that it should easily fall 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ out of the sheath to the ground as it says (Samuel II 20:8) “and he went out towards Amasa and it fell 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ out.” As soon as it fell, Joab [nonchalantly] retrieved it, and held it ready in his hand. Amasa presumed 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he retrieved it solely to pick it up from the ground, and was not alert to guard himself against an attack 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from the sword which was in Joab’s hand.
