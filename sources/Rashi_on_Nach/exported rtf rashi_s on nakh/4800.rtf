\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Tanhuma (Gen. 48:1) expounds it in reference to the sons of Joseph. When he brought them before 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Jacob to bless them, Jacob perceived wicked men destined to come from Ephraim, viz. Jeroboam and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Ahab, and the Holy Spirit left him, ìand he said: Who are these?î Joseph prayed for mercy, and the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Holy Spirit rested on Jacob and he blessed them. This is the meaning of: And I trained My spirit upon 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Jacob for Ephraimís benefit, and he took them on his arms.
