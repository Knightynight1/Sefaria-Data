The following is an explanation 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from the author of ëThe Temple Structureí: \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And the work of the base was in this manner\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  He made 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ four copper wheels as it says (7:30) ìAnd each base had four copper wheelsî as the form of a large 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wagon. And the height of each wheel was a cubit and a half. And the work of the wheels was like the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ work of a chariot wheel, a wheel within a wheel, so that he may be able to move them wherever the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ spirit or will may be to move them there, and move them without being necessary to turn it over this 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ way or that. And the distance which is from one wheel to the next from east to west was four cubits 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and likewise from north to south, for it was square, not long like our wagons. And this is what he said, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (7:27) ìfour cubits [was] the length of the base, and four cubits the breadth thereof.î A thick and long 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ rod was inserted into the two wheels which were from east to west, the northern ones. And so also, as 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ in those wheels which were in these, a rod placed and inserted in those which were from the north to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the south, the eastern ones, and so also in the western ones. And the verse called these rods \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ È»„Â…˙\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ this is what he said \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÂƒÈ„Â…˙≈È‰∆Ì\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  And the meaning of \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Â¿‚«·Ã≈È‰∆Ì\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , that is the hub of the wheels in which these 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ rods turn. And they are called \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ‚«·\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , a little hill, because that is the highest part of the wheel when it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ lying on the ground. And likewise the hub of all round objects is its highest point, because all sides are 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ drawn from it. And the meaning of \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Â¿Áƒ˘—À˜≈È‰∆Ì\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , they are the outer circles which bind together \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Áƒ˘—À¯≈È‰∆Ì

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the rim, and this is from the expression, ìand their fillets were of silverî (Exodus 27:10), and that is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the wheel which rolls on the ground, and we are accustomed to make a circular piece of metal around

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ borders were foursquare not roundî (7:31) and they enclosed the wagon on its four sides, [and was] 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ therefore called \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÓƒÒ¿‚»¯Â…˙\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , enclosures. And on these borders or enclosures were boards of copper \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ¿Ò»¯ƒÈÌ

And on them, that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is, on the outside and not on top, it was made as the rungs of a ladder; and between one rung and the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ other [there were] other borders, and on them was the form of oxen (7:29). And the boards went up 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ beyond the borders until it [reached] opposite the height of the wheels, [they were continuously] 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sloping like a pointy hat and resembling the covering of a covered wagon, until they reached opposite 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the height of the wheel, and there they were drawn together until they covered it, except above the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ center they did not cover, but there was a round hole in them. Its diameter was a cubit and a half. This 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ covering was called \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃÂ…˙∆¯∆˙\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  and the hole which is in it \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÙÃƒÈ ‰«ÎÃÂ…˙∆¯∆˙\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  and this is what he said (7:31) ìand the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ mouth thereof was round after the work of a base, a cubit and a half.î And around this hole a partition 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ goes up a half cubit in height, and this is what he said (7:35) ìand in the top of the base there was a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ round compass of half a cubit high.î And into this partition the \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃ≈Ô\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  is entered and inserted, for the \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃ≈Ô\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  is a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ receptacle which receives the laver, since the laver is inserted into the \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃ≈Ô\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  and the \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃ≈Ô\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  is in the midst of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ this partition which is on the wagon. And the lower half cubit of the \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃ≈Ô\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  was round in the same 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ measurement of the height of the partition which is on the round hole which is in the base on top. And 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃ≈Ô\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  rises above this partition one cubit, and this what was said, (7:31) ìand the mouth of it within 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the chapiter and above was a cubit.î And therefore, we have three cubits in the total height of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ base, since the wheel was a cubit and a half, and the round partition was a half cubit, and the cubit 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which the height of the \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃ≈Ô\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  protrudes over it, and this cubit is square. And it had four undersetters in its 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ four corners, and this is what the verse said, (7:34) ìand there were four undersetters at etc. of each 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ base, the undersetters were of the base itself,î because the lower part of the laver was slanting at the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ bottom so that it should fit into the \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÎÃ≈Ô\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  and in order that it should not fall into it more than the desired 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ amount, therefore these undersetters were made, to carry and support it. This ends the quotation 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of ëThe Temple Structure.í
