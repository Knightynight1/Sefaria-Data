\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ This is a transposed verse, expounded from its end to its beginning. Just as you do not know the way of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the wind, i.e., the knowledge of both these things is equal. Neither is this one revealed to you nor is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that one revealed to you. Sometimes you think to perceive in the clouds that the wind will come, and it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ does not come here, but it passes and goes away to another land. This expression is like (Gen. 13: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 10): ìlike the garden of the Lord, so the land of Egyptî; (Isa. 24:2): ìas with the maidservant, so with 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ her mistress; as with the buyer so with the seller.î Sometimes Scripture compares the former to the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ latter, and sometimes it compares the latter to the former. Here too, it teaches the knowledge of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wind from the knowledge of the womb, i.e., you should not await the wind by looking at the clouds.
