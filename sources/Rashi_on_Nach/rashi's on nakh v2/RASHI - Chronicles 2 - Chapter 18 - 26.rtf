\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he says, “and return him,” you may say that he had placed him in prison beforehand. If, however, you 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wish to say that they had never placed him in prison prior to this, “and return him” should not cause 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ you any difficulty, because this is the style of the Scriptures, like (Ps. 9:18): “May the wicked return to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the grave,” and many similar other cases. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ a scant amount of bread, etc.\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  An example of this is (Isa. 30: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 20): “scant bread and water of oppression.”
