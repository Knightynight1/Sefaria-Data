<b> Habakkuk</b>  <b> Chapter 1</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> The prophecy</b>  Heb.  המשא . The burden of prophecy - what he bore and received by the Holy Spirit.  [after Jonathan ]  <b> 2</b>  <b> O Lord! How long</b>  -He foresaw with the Holy Spirit that Nebuchadnezzar was destined to be the  ruler of the world and to cause trouble for Israel, as the matter is stated in his prophecy (1:6): For  behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, etc. He was complaining for this. <b> I cry out to You of violence</b>  I  mention before You the violence committed against me, and You do not save me.  <b> 3</b>  <b> iniquity</b>  plunder and violence. <b> and look upon mischief</b>  You look upon this mischief, but You do not  help. <b> and the one who bears quarrel and strife endures</b>  And this wicked man who bears quarrel and  strife, will live, remain in existence, and prosper. <b> endures</b>  He who bears quarrel and strife will endure.  So did Jonathan  render.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Therefore Torah is slackened</b>  Because of this, that Israel sees his [the wicked mans] success, the  Torah will slacken and leave them; and they [Israel] will obey him [the wicked man] and prostrate  themselves before the idol in the valley of Dura. <b> and justice does not go out forever</b>  I.e., the true  decision of the Law. <b> surrounds</b>  surrounds, as in (Ps. 22:13): Strong bulls of Bashan have surrounded  me  (כתרוני) .  <b> 5</b>  <b> You shall not believe when it is told</b>  When this is told to you, that I am setting up the Chaldeans,  the people that did not deserve to be created, as it is written (Isa. 23:13): This people has never  been. They are one of three things whose creation God regrets, and now [they] will rise, and [they]  will be bitter, and [they will be] impetuous to run and to march to the breadth of the lands of all the  nations.  <b> 7</b>  <b> from themselves their judgment and their burden shall emanate</b>  From them are judges; from  them are kings, who cast a burden and a fear upon all. <b> their judgment</b>  joustice  in O.F:  <b> 8</b>  <b> and their riders shall increase</b>  Heb.  ופשו .  <b> 9</b>  <b> come to commit violence</b>  to plunder and to spoil. <b> the eagerness of their faces</b>  an expression like  (Gen. 24: 17) Give me to swallow,  (הגמיאיני)  I pray you and (Job 39:24) He swallows  (י גמה)  the earth. He runs swiftly - in a short time a distance of a days plowing - as though he had swallowed  and drunk the earth that is before him. Here, too, the swallowing of their faces; the swallowing, the  longing of their faces resembles the east wind, the fiercest of the winds. So did Jonathan  render this.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And they shall mock the kings</b>  shall mock them. Every expression of  ק לסה  is an expression for  the speech of those speaking about another; some [of these speeches] are for good, and some for bad - parledic  in O.F. <b> a laughingstock</b>  like  שחוק , laughter, like  משמר , a watch, and  מסתר , a hiding place. <b> shall scoff at every fortress</b>  If his enemy is in a strong fortress, he scoffs at him. <b> he piles up earth </b> upon it with his many armies, each one carrying a load of earth. It [the pile] is before the wall as a high  mound, and they [the Chaldeans] battle from upon it. This is called  שפיכתסוללה , pouring a siege mound  (cf. Isa. 37:33), for all of them are translated into Aramaic:  ויצבור עלה מליתא , and he piled upon it a  filling. This is an expression of Milo, for in the city of David there was a high mound, and they would  battle upon it. Atop the mound was built a tower whose slant was inclined to the sides, and around its  base was a low wall to prevent the earth from falling.  <b> 11</b>  <b> Then a spirit goes further</b>  Then, when they see their way prospering, a spirit of guilt goes further  and passes over them. Now what is the spirit? <b> this strength they attribute to their god</b>  This strength  they attribute to their god, and they say, My god acquired all this wealth for me. Says the  prophet, Now, You, why should You remain silent to all this?  <b> 12</b>  <b> Are You not from everlasting, O Lord, my God, my Holy One?</b>  Who shall not die. Now, the  reason it is written  לא נמות  we shall not die, is that it is one of the emendations of the scribes in  Scripture, by which Scripture euphemizes. Likewise, (Mal. 1:13) And you sadden it. And so are  many of them [these euphemisms] explained in Sifre  (Num. 10:35). According to the emendation of the  scribes, this is its explanation: Are you not my God from everlasting, my Holy One? Do not deliver us  into their hands to die. <b> O Lord, You have ordained them for judgment</b>  I know that You have set this  one [Nebuchadnezzar] up only to judge those who rebel against You. In any case, why should all this  come about? Is it not so that...  <b> 13</b>  <b> [You are] of eyes too pure</b>  to behold evil? <b> gaze</b>  like  ולהביט , and to gaze upon iniquity. <b> righteous than he</b>  that he will blind the eyes of Zedekiah (II Kings 25:7).  <b> 14</b>  <b> And You have made man</b>  before this wicked man - free as the fish of the sea, which anyone who  wishes may catch.  <b> 15</b>  <b> He takes all of them up with the fishhook</b>  This wicked man takes up all people with his fishhook. <b> catches them</b>  an expression of (Prov. 6:8) Gathers  (אגרה)  her food in the harvest, and (Joel 1:  17) Granaries  (ממגרות)  are demolished.  <b> 16</b>  <b> he sacrifices to his net</b>  To his god, for he says that it conquers everyone before him. <b> them</b>  This is similar to  בהם , because of them. <b> a fatling</b>  fat.  <b> 17</b>  <b> Because of this does he arm himself with his net</b>  There are many interrogative forms that are  affirmative, e.g., (I Sam. 2:27) Did I appear? concerning Eli, and (II Sam. 15:27) Do you  see? Here, too: Does it appear in Your eyes that because of this he prospers every time, in that he  arms himself with his net over everyone and to hunt game? <b> arms himself</b>  As in (Gen. 14:14) And he  armed  (וי רק)  his trained men and (Ps. 35:3): 'Arm yourself  (הרק)  with a spear. He arms himself  with his net.   <b> Chapter 2</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> On my watch I will stand</b>  Habakkuk dug a circular hole, stood within it, and said, I will not budge  from here until I hear what He will say to me concerning this, my question why He looks and sees the  prosperity of a wicked man. <b> and what I will reply</b>  to those who come to contend with me. <b> am reproved</b>  mon aprobement  in O.F.; the reproach one addresses to me. <b> when I am reproved</b>  For they  reprove me to my face that one should criticize the Divine standard of justice.  <b> 2</b>  <b> And the Lord answered me and said: Write</b>  for yourself the vision that will be revealed to you,  and explain it well on the tablets so that one may read it swiftly. And this is the vision that you shall  write.  <b> 3</b>  <b> For there shall be another vision for the appointed time</b>  A prophet shall yet arise at the end of  the years, to whom a vision shall be revealed concerning when the appointed time shall be for the  downfall of Babylon and the redemption of Israel. <b> and He shall speak of the end</b>  The speech that He  shall say to him concerning the end of Babylon, (Jer. 29:10) For at the completion of seventy years of  Babylon.  ויפח  is an expression of speech; and there are many uses of this root with similar meaning  in the Book of Proverbs. Since speech is only the wind emanating from the mouth, he [the writer of  the Scriptures] calls it  פיח , blowing, and he calls it wind, e.g., (Ps. 33:6) And with the wind of His  mouth all their host. <b> and it shall not fail; though it tarry</b>  it shall not fail to come, though that  appointed time may take long to come. <b> wait for it for...; it shall not delay</b>  at all after the seventy  years. This clause can also be explained to mean: though he tarry, meaning the prophet Jeremiah. Jonathan  renders: the prophecy is written and explained in the Book of the Torah. He translated  כתב  as  כתוב . It has already been alluded to in the Torah (Lev. 26:34): Then shall the land placate [God  concerning] its Sabbaths. Israel sinned by violating seventy Sabbatical Years, in which they did not  release the land, and, corresponding to them, they were exiled therefrom for seventy years. And so it is  stated in II Chronicles (36:21): Until the land placated its Sabbaths; all the days it lay waste, it rested  to complete seventy years. And so you find in Ezekiel (4:5): And I have given you the years of their  iniquity according to the number of days, three hundred and ninety days... (verse 6) I gave you a day  for a year. And Scripture says (verse 4): And you lie on your left side, etc. You are found saying  that Israel provoked God for three hundred and ninety years until the Ten Tribes were exiled, and the  tribe of Judah sinned for forty years, and from the time the Ten Tribes were exiled until the destruction  of Jerusalem are the twenty-two years of Manasseh. The rest of Manassehs years were spent in  repentance, for it is stated concerning him (II Kings 21:2f.) And he did what was evil, etc.,... as  Ahab... had made. Therefore we count Manassehs evil years according to the number of Ahabs  years, and he reigned for twenty-two years. With two years of his son Amons reign, and eleven of  Jehoiakims, and eleven of Zedekiahs, the evil years total forty-six, and this prophecy was said to  Ezekiel in the fifth year of Zedekiah. In any case, we find the time of their sinning four hundred and  thirty years, for after this prophecy they tarried there six years. [I.e., the two tribes of Judah and  Benjamin remained in the land for six more years] In four hundred years, there are eight Jubilee Years,  and in every Jubilee cycle there are seven Release Years, making a total of fifty-six Release Years and  eight years consecrated as Jubilee Years making all together sixty-four. In thirty-six years there are  five Release Years, totaling sixty-nine consecrated years, and this final Jubilee year is also counted in  the number, since it was not completed because of their iniquity. And here, this is what the Holy One,  blessed be He, said to Habakkuk: A vision is already written in the Torah, but it is sealed. You write  and explain on the tablets, for a vision of this appointed time will yet be revealed. <b> and He shall speak </b> It is an expression [denoting] speech, and there are many similar instances throughout the book of  Proverbs. Since speech is merely wind that goes out of the mouth, it is called  פיח  or  רוח , wind, as in  (Psalms 33:6) and with the breath of His mouth, all their host.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Behold, it is puffed up</b>  The soul of the wicked man is always wroth and full of desire, longing to  swallow and never satisfied.  עפלה  is an expression of insolence, as in (Num. 14:44) And they acted  insolently  (ויעפילו) ; and (Isa. 32:14) Rampart  (עפל)  and tower. <b> him</b>  His spirit is not satisfied within him, and he does not say, What I have already acquired is  enough. Therefore, retribution shall come upon him. <b> but the righteous shall live by his faith </b> Jeconiah the king, whom this wicked man is destined to exile - his righteousness shall stand for him,  and on the day this one is cast out of his grave, Evil-merodach shall raise Jehoiachins head and  place his throne above the thrones of the kings.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And surely he, whom wine betrays</b>  And surely, when Belshazzar, this ones grandson, comes; the  one whose wine shall betray him for he drank as much wine as a thousand (Dan. 5:1). <b> whose dwelling shall not remain</b>  [Belshazzars] dwelling and his residence shall not remain in  existence, for he was haughty and said, with the counsel of the wine, to bring the vessels of the  Temple; and he drank with them. That shall cause him to be slain, and the seed of Nebuchadnezzar to  be destroyed, for a haughty man is a scorner; he shall not have a dwelling. Neither he nor his dwelling  shall remain in existence. <b> who widened</b>  Nebuchadnezzar <b> his desire like the nether-world</b>  to attain all  his desire with a full heart. <b> and he is like death</b>  Like the angel of death, who is not sated with slaying.  So is this one not sated with all his possessions.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Shall not all these</b>  whom he [Belshazzar] collected for himself to pay himself tribute? <b> parable against him and a figure</b>  they shall take up in their mouth an expression of a riddle  concerning him. <b> against him</b>  like  עליו , upon him. <b> And he shall say</b>  The one who says the figure of  the riddle <b> Woe to him who increases what is not his!</b>  This is the figure: Woe to him who increases  wealth and kingdom, and it is not his, for the kings of Media shall come and take everything. <b> long?</b>  will he continue to increase when he is only loading upon himself a burden of iniquity like a  beam of mud?  עב  is an expression of a heavy beam, as we find concerning the Tabernacle of Ezekiel  (Ezek. 41:25): And a wooden beam  (ועב) , and (ibid. 26) The casings of the House and the beams  (והעבים) .  <b> 7</b>  <b> awaken</b>  like  ויקיצו   <b> 8</b>  <b> Since you have cast away many nations</b>  You have cast them and thrown them from their place. <b> remaining peoples shall cast you away</b>  The nations that escaped. <b> because of the blood of man</b>  As  revenge for the blood of Israel, called man, as it is said (Ezek. 34:31): You are man." <b> violence done to the land</b>  The land of Israel. <b> the city</b>  Jerusalem.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Woe to him who gains evil gains</b>  Who robs money which is harmful to him. <b> for his house</b>  To build  a house for himself <b> to place his nest on high</b>  As it is written in the Book of Daniel (4:27): Is this not  the great Babylon, which I built up as a royal residence with the might of my power, etc.? At the time  this statement emanated from his mouth, [Nebuchadnezzar] was driven away from men, as it is said  (ibid. 28): When this word was still in the kings mouth, etc.  <b> 10</b>  <b> With this matter, you advised shame for your house</b>  For you advised to cut off many peoples,  and you caused a loss for yourself. <b> to cut off</b>  an expression of stripping and peeling, as in (Lev. 14:  43) Scraping the house. <b> and you have sinned against your life</b>  As in (Prov. 20:2) He who  provokes him sins against his life. He sins to lose his life; forsfait sa arme  in O.F. he forfeits his soul.  <b> 11</b>  <b> For a stone</b>  For the stones that you stole shall cry from the wall. <b> and a chip</b>  of the wood shall  answer it [the stone]. It shall answer aloud the stone that is opposite it; hence both of them cry. <b> chip shall answer it from a beam</b>  Jonathan  renders:  ושפא מגו מרישא .  שפא  is an expression of a chip;  שפאים  in the language of the Sages; dokldours  in O.F. - chips.  מריש  is a beam.  <b> 13</b>  <b> Behold, is it not from the Lord</b>  that the retribution has been requited to the perpetrators of  wickedness? <b> And peoples shall toil until they are sated with fire</b>  When My wrath, which is like fire,  shall come upon them until they are sated.  בדי אש  - Asec  in O.F.; enough; assez in modern French.  <b> 15</b>  <b> Woe to him who gives his friend to drink</b>  wine; and into that drink he adds and gathers his venom  upon him, and also makes him [his friend] drunk with his venom. All this he does... <b> upon their nakedness</b>  Upon their exposure, to see their nakedness. This is the wicked  Nebuchadnezzar, who would give the kings wine to drink, intoxicate them, and practice pederasty  upon them, as we state in Tractate Shabbath  (149b). Another explanation. <b> friend to drink</b>  In Seder Olam, it [this verse] is expounded regarding Belshazzar, who gave the princes  to drink with the vessels of the Temple, because of which they were smitten with zaraath and  intoxicated by the wrath of the Holy One, blessed be He. On that night he [Belshazzar] was slain. <b> upon their nakedness</b>  So that their disgrace be revealed, and their enemies see their disgrace.  <b> 16</b>  <b> and become clogged up</b>  The he serves in this word as an expression of the reflexive, as in  (Deut. 32:50) And you shall be gathered to your people. Here, too,  הערל  - you shall become clogged  up with bewilderment and with astonishment of heart. Every expression of  ערלה  is an expression of  clogging, like (Jer. 6:10) Their ear is clogged and (Ezek 44:7) Of clogged heart and of  uncircumcised flesh. Jonathan  rendered: And become naked, an expression of (ibid. 16:7) Naked and  bare.  <b> 17</b>  <b> the violence of the Lebanon</b>  the Temple. <b> and the plunder of cattle</b>  The plunder of your cattle,  and your hordes that plundered My people Israel, shall break you. <b> because of the blood of man </b> Because of the violence done to the blood of Israel. <b> and the violence of the land</b>  The land of Israel. <b> city</b>  Jerusalem.  <b> 18</b>  <b> What did a graven image avail</b>  Babylon? <b> that the maker of his work trusted</b>  The man who  formed it, who is the maker of this god of his. <b> in it</b>  He trusts in this creation of his, that it assists him,  so he comes to make dumb idols.  <b> 19</b>  <b> Shall it teach?</b>  This is a question.  <b> 20</b>  <b> But the Lord is in His Holy Temple</b>  ready to exact retribution.  Silence the whole earth  before Him  הס  is an expression of silencing and the silence of destruction.   <b> Chapter 3</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> concerning the errors</b>  This may be interpreted according to the Targum . However, according to the  apparent meaning, Habakkuk is begging for mercy for himself because he spoke rebelliously: (1:  4) Therefore Torah is slackened, and (verse 14) You have made man like the fish of the sea. He  criticized the Divine standard of justice.  <b> 2</b>  <b> I heard a report of You</b>  that from days of yore You always inflicted retribution upon those who  provoked You, yet You tolerate this wicked man. <b> I feared</b>  I said, How has the Divine standard of  justice changed because of Israels iniquity? <b> Your deed. In the midst of the years</b>  Your original  deed, that You would wreak vengeance for us upon our enemies in the midst of the years of trouble in  which we are found. <b> revive it</b>  Awaken it and restore it. <b> in the midst of the years</b>  And in the midst of  these years let it be known. <b> In anger</b>  In the anger that You will vent upon the wicked, You will  remember to have mercy. <b> to have mercy</b>  like  לרחם , to have mercy. <b> You shall remember</b>  You shall  remember to have mercy on Israel.  <b> 3</b>  <b> God</b>  The prophet now mentions before God His original deed, which he begs Him to revive - the  deed of the love of Israel and the retribution of the first generations: When You came to give the  Torah, You went around to Esau and Ishmael, and they did not accept it. <b> Teman</b>  Esau. <b> Paran </b> Ishmael, as Scripture states (Gen. 21:21): And he dwelt in the desert of Paran. <b> the heavens</b>  at Sinai for Israel.  <b> 4</b>  <b> And there was a brightness</b>  on that day. <b> like the light</b>  Like the special light of the seven days of  Creation. So did Jonathan  render it. <b> rays</b>  The expression of a light, which, when piercing and shining  through a hole, appears like protruding horns. Similarly, (Ex. 34:29) For the skin of his face  shone. <b> from His hand</b>  From the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, they came to them. <b> was His strength hidden</b>  As the Targum  renders: There His strength, which had previously been  hidden, was revealed in the secret place of the Most High.  <b> 5</b>  <b> A pestilence went before Him</b>  I found in a Midrash Aggadah: At the time the Holy One, blessed be  He, gave the Torah to Israel, He drove away the Angel of Death to divert him to other things, lest he  stand to accuse and say, You are giving the Torah to a nation that is destined to deny you at the end  of forty days? <b> and sparks went out at His feet</b>  Fiery angels came with Him to Sinai.  <b> 6</b>  <b> He stood and meted out to the earth</b>  He waited to examine minutely the case of the generation of  the Flood, to mete out to them a measure for a measure, and He meted it out. He stood is to be  understood in the sense of (Isa. 3: 13) The Lord stands to plead, and He stands to judge the  peoples. He waits and examines their case minutely. <b> and meted out to the earth</b>  They sinned with  heat, and they were judged with boiling water. <b> He saw</b>  the generation of separation, who, since they  were of one language, all came upon the plan, as it is written (Gen. 1 1:1): And all the earth was of  one language. <b> and caused nations to wander</b>  He caused them to jump into seventy languages as it is  said (Lev. 11:21): To jump with them on the earth, and (Job 37:1) My heart trembles and jumps  from its place. <b> the everlasting mountains</b>  The heavenly princes of the nations. <b> the world are His</b>  He demonstrated to them that all the procedures of the world are His.  <b> 7</b>  <b> Because of iniquity</b>  that was found in Israel. <b> I saw the tents of Cushan</b>  standing in the open and  inflicting injury upon Israel, and when they humbled themselves before you... <b> the curtains... quaked </b> All is to be understood according to the Targum .  <b> 8</b>  <b> Was... with the rivers?</b>  Some questions are in the affirmative. Have we seen that He performed all  these? The explanation of the verse is according to the Targum . <b> Your chariots</b>  were salvation for us.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Your bow revealed itself</b>  Your might was revealed. <b> the oaths to the tribes</b>  The oaths that You  swore to the tribes. <b> perpetual statement</b>  A statement that is to last forever.  אמר  is vowelized with  a pattah, [meaning a seggol] and the accent is on the first syllable, making it a noun. <b> earth into rivers</b>  According to the Targum .  <b> 10</b>  <b> Mountains saw You and quaked</b>  The mountains of the streams of Arnon that cleft to one another. <b> A stream of water passed</b>  When they crossed the Jordan, the water was completely cut off, and the  flow of the stream of water passed downstream; the water which came down from above stood and  rose up. <b> The deep gave forth its voice</b>  The inhabitants of the land praised Him. <b> up its thanks</b>  The host of the heaven thanked Him.  <b> 11</b>  <b> stood in their dwellings</b>  in their dwellings. In every word that requires a lammed at the  beginning - Scripture placed a he at the end [meaning to]. They explained the phrase as referring  to the war of Gibeon, as the Targum  paraphrases it. <b> to the light of Your arrows they go</b>  Israel.  <b> 12</b>  <b> With fury You tread the earth</b>  to drive out the seven nation [the heathens of Canaan].  <b> 13</b>  <b> to rescue Your anointed</b>  Saul and David. <b> uncovering it from the foundation</b>  The walls of their  enemies. <b> to the neck</b>  The height of the walls and the towers.  <b> 14</b>  <b> You pierced the heads... with war clubs</b>  Sennacherib and his company. <b> the heads of his villages </b> The heads of his towns and his castles, as in (Deut. 3:5) The open towns and (Zech. 2:8) Jerusalem  shall be inhabited without walls. <b> they storm</b>  Who were storming with a tempest to scatter me.  [Sennacherib] was the staff with which you chastised the nations. When he came and stormed to  scatter me, You pierced the heads of his troops with his staffs, with which he had come to chastise me. <b> their joy</b>  was when they could... <b> devour a poor one in secret</b>  Israel, known as a poor people.  <b> 15</b>  <b> You trampled in the sea</b>  You trampled upon [Sennacheribs] hordes, which were as heavy as the  sand by the sea. <b> a heap of many waters</b>  Jonathan  renders. upon a heap, an expression of (Exod. 8:  10) many heaps.  <b> 16</b>  <b> I heard, and my inward parts trembled</b>  Jonathan  rendered. Said Babylon, I heard, and the kings  trembled before the judgement meted out upon the Egyptians. <b> my lips quivered at the sound</b>  At the  sound of the report, trembling took hold of me until my lips knocked one against the other and their  sound was heard. <b> quivered</b>  An expression of (Zech. 14:20) The bells of the horses. Tentir  in O.F., to  tinkle. <b> and I quaked in my place</b>  In my place, I quake. <b> day of trouble</b>  That this tranquility of mine is destined for a day of trouble. <b> will troop back</b>  For the day that He said to bring up from there the people that He will cause to troop  back, to return with its troops to its land.  <b> 17</b>  <b> For a fig tree shall not blossom</b>  As the Targum renders. However, the phrase may be interpreted  according to its simple meaning: From now on, none of Babylons deeds shall succeed. <b> the grain field </b> a white field. <b> from the fold</b>  a stall for sheep.  <b> 18</b>  <b> Yet I</b>  the nation of Israel, will rejoice in the Lord. <b> melodies</b>  To the Levite who conducts the music in the Temple. I will compose for him [the  Levites conductor] with my melodies, and the Levite[s] will accompany him with musical  instruments. <b> To the conductor</b>  As it is stated (Ezra 3:8) ... appointed the Levites from twenty years  old and upward to superintend the work of the house of the Lord. <b> with my melodies</b>  This is an  expression of a vocal melody to raise and lower, orgenedors  in O.F.
