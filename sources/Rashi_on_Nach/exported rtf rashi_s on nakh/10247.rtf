\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [found] above (16:5): “... but I have walked from tent to tent and from tabernacle,” which 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ means: “and from tabernacle to tabernacle.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ like the small one so the great one, scholar with pupil 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ The meaning is that they cast lots for the watches, this one against that one, a watch against a watch, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the small one was like the great one, the expert master with the pupil, all of them were equal in this, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for the one on whom the first lot fell, if to the small one, he would come first to be the first one, and if 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ last, he would be the last one, and so all of them, whether a scholar or a pupil, whether a small person 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ or a great one. And these watches of the Levites followed the watches of the priests: the one to whom 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the first lot fell had the first lot, and his watch was with the watch of Jehoiarib the priest, and the one 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to whom the second lot fell waited, and his watch was with the watch of Jedaiah the priest.
