\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Nebuchadnezzar, who would give the kings wine to drink, intoxicate them, and practice pederasty 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ upon them, as we state in Tractate \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Shabbath\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  (149b). Another explanation. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ Woe to him who gives his

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to drink with the vessels of the Temple, because of which they were smitten with zaraath and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ intoxicated by the wrath of the Holy One, blessed be He. On that night he [Belshazzar] was slain. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ upon their nakedness\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  So that their disgrace be revealed, and their enemies see their disgrace.
