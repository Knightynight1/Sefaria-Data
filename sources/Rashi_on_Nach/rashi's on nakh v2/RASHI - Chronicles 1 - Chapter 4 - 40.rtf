\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 7): “... and they had no bond with any man.” Because they were tranquil, they were not afraid, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ they did not make a pact with anyone to help them; therefore, five hundred men defeated them. It is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ also written above (verse 7): “... after the manner of the Zidonians, tranquil and secure, etc.”
