\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ inadvertently \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and it hit\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  The arrow [hit] the king of Israel. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ between the scales and the coat of mail 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ between the thong with which they attach the helmet on his head to the coat of mail. We cannot say 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that he was a heathen, because whom was he aiming at? Did not the king of Aram command, “Attack 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ neither small nor great, except the king of Israel” ? And he did not even aim at him, for it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ written, “innocently.” Perforce, you must say that the archer was an Israelite who intended to shoot at 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the camp of Aram, and inadvertently hit the king of Israel. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and he said to the charioteer\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  to the one 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ who drives the chariot. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and carry me out of the camp\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  i.e., away from these front lines, and take me 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to the rear lines.
