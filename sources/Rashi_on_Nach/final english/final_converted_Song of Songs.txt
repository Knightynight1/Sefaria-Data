<b> Song of Songs</b>  <b> Chapter 1</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> The Song of Songs, which is Solomons</b>  Our Rabbis taught (Shevu. 35b): Every Solomon (for they  were at a loss to explain why Scripture did not mention his father, as it did in Proverbs and  Ecclesiastes) mentioned in the Song of Songs is sacred (refers to God), the King to Whom peace  (שלום)  belongs. It is a song that is above all songs, which was recited to the Holy One, blessed be He,  by His congregation and His people, the congregation of Israel. Rabbi Akiva said: The world was  never as worthy as on the day that the Song of Songs was given to Israel, for all the Writings are holy,  whereas the Song of Songs is the holiest of the holy. Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah said: To what can this  be compared? To a king who took a seah of wheat and gave it to a baker. He said to him, Extract for  me so much fine flour, so much bran, so much coarse bran, and you shall produce enough fine flour  for one white loaf, sifted and superior. So are all the Writings holy and the Song of Songs the holiest  of the holy, for it is all comprised of fear of Heaven and the acceptance of the yoke of His kingdom.  <b> 2</b>  <b> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth</b>  She recites this song with her mouth, in her exile and  in her widowhood: If only King Solomon would kiss me with the kisses of his mouth as of  old, because in some places they kiss on the back of the hand or on the shoulder, but I desire and  wish that he behave toward me as he behaved toward me originally, like a bridegroom with a bride,  mouth to mouth. <b> for...is better</b>  your love [is better] to me more than any wine banquet and more than  any pleasure and joy. In the Hebrew language, every banquet of pleasure and joy is called after the  wine, as it is stated (Esther 7:8): to the house of the wine feast; (Isa. 24:9): In song they shall not  drink wine; (ibid. 5:12): And there were harp and lute, tambourine and flute, and wine at their  drinking feasts. This is the explanation of its apparent meaning. This figure of speech was used  because He gave them His Torah and spoke to them face to face, and that love is still more pleasant to  them than any pleasure, and they are assured by Him that He will appear to them to explain to them  the secret of its reasons and its hidden mysteries, and they entreat Him to fulfill His word, and this is  the meaning of Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Because of the fragrance of your goodly oils</b>  A good name is referred to by the expression, good  oil. <b> Because of the fragrance of your goodly oils</b>  that those dwelling at the ends of the earth  smelled, [i.e.,] those who heard of Your good fame when You performed awesome deeds in Egypt. <b> your name is oil poured forth.</b>  Your name is [thus] called. It is said about you that you are oil that  is constantly being poured forth so that your fragrant scent wafts forth to a distance, for so is the  nature of fragrant oil. As long as it is in a sealed bottle, its scent does not carry. If one opens it and  pours the oil into another vessel, its scent carries. <b> Therefore, the maidens loved you</b>  Jethro came at  the sound of the news and converted; also Rahab the harlot said, (Josh. 2:10f.): For we have heard  how the Lord dried up, etc., and thereby, the Lord your God, He is God in heaven, etc. <b> maidens </b> virgins, since the text compares Him to a youth whose beloved holds him dear, and according to the  allegory, the maidens are the nations.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Draw me, we will run after you</b>  I heard from your messengers a hint that you said to draw me, and  I said, We will run after you to be your wife. <b> the king brought me to his chambers</b>  And even this  very day, I still have joy and happiness that I cleaved to you. <b> We will recall your love</b>  Even today, in  living widowhood, I recall your early love more than any banquet of pleasure and joy. <b> you sincerely</b>  a strong love, a straightforward love, without crookedness (Heb.  עקיבה ) or deceit (Heb.  רכסים ), [after Isaiah 40:4: and the crooked terrain  (העקב)  shall become a plain and the rugged  mountains  (והרכסים)  a valley], that my ancestors and I loved you in those days. This is its simple  meaning according to its context, and according to its allegorical meaning, they mention before Him  the loving kindness of [their] youth, the love of [their] nuptials, their following Him in the desert, a  land of aridness and darkness, and they did not even prepare supplies for themselves, but they  believed in Him and in His messenger, and they did not say, How will we go out into the desert,  which is not a land of seed or food, but they followed Him, and He brought them into the midst of the  chambers of the encompassment of His clouds. With this, they are still joyful today and happy in Him  despite their afflictions and distress, and they delight in the Torah, and there they recall His love more  than wine and the sincerity of their love for Him.  <b> 5</b>  <b> I am black but comely, etc.</b>  You, my friends, let me not be light in your eyes even if my husband  has left me because of my blackness, for I am black because of the suns gaze, but I am comely with  the shape of beautiful limbs, and if I am black as the tents of Kedar, which are blackened by the rain,  for they are constantly spread out in the deserts, I am easily cleansed to be like the curtains of  Solomon. The allegory is that the congregation of Israel says to the nations: I am black in my deeds,  but I am comely in the deeds of my ancestors, and even some of my deeds are comely. If I am guilty  of the iniquity of the [Golden] Calf, I can counter it with the merit of the acceptance of the Torah  (Song Rabbah). He calls the nations the daughters of Jerusalem because she [Jerusalem] is destined to  become the metropolis for them all, as Ezekiel prophesied (16:61): and I shall give them to you for  daughters, like (Josh. 15:45): Ekron, with her towns  (ובנוהיה) .  <b> 6</b>  <b> Do not look upon me</b>  Do not look upon me disdainfully [like (I Sam. 6:19) for they had gazed upon  the Ark of the Lord]. <b> because I am swarthy</b>  For my blackness and my ugliness are not from my  mothers womb, but from tanning from the sun, for that blackness can easily be whitened by staying in  the shade. <b> my mothers sons were incensed against me</b>  These are the Egyptians among whom I grew  up, and they went up with me in the mixed multitude; they were incensed against me with their  enticement and their seduction until they made me... <b> a keeper of the vineyards</b>  and there the sun  tanned me and I became blackened; i.e., they made me a worshipper of alien gods, but my own  vineyard, which I had from my forefathers, I did not keep. We find that in the Scripture, leaders are  called by an expression of vineyards, as it is said (Hos. 2:17): And I will give to her her vineyards  from there, which the Targum renders: And I will appoint her leaders for her. And similarly (Job  24:18): he will not turn by the way of the vineyards.  <b> 7</b>  <b> Tell me, you whom my soul loves</b>  The Divine Spirit repeatedly compares her to the flock that is  beloved to the shepherd. The congregation of Israel says before Him as a woman to her husband, Tell  me, You Whom my soul loves, where do You feed Your flock among these wolves in whose midst  they are, and where do You rest them at noon, in this exile, which is a distressful time for them, like  noon, which is a distressful time for the flock? <b> for why should I be like one who veils herself</b>  And if  you ask, What does it concern you? It is not dignified for you that I should be like a mourner, with a  veil over my lip, weeping for my flock. <b> beside the flocks of your companions</b>  beside the flocks of the  other shepherds, who pasture flocks as you do; i.e., among the flocks of the heathens, who rely on  pagan deities, and who have kings and princes who lead them.  <b> 8</b>  <b> If you do not, etc.</b>  This is the shepherds reply: If you do not know where you should go to feed  your flock, you, O fairest of women, for the shepherd has ceased pasturing them. <b> footsteps of the flocks</b>  Look at the footsteps, the way that the flocks went, and the heels are  discernible, traces in French, tracks. There are many similar instances in Scripture, e.g. (Ps. 77:  20): and Your steps  (ועקבותיך)  were not known; (Jer. 13:22): your steps  (עקביך)  were cut off;  (Gen. 49:19): and his troops will return in their tracks  (עקב) . He will return in his tracks; now go  that way. <b> and pasture your kids beside the shepherds dwellings</b>  among the dwellings of the other  shepherds beside whom you are, and this is the allegory: If you do not know, My assembly and My  congregation, O fairest of women, [the fairest] of the nations, where you will pasture and be saved  from the hand of those who oppress you, to be among them, and that your children should not perish,  ponder the ways of your early ancestors, who received My Torah and kept My watch and My  commandments, and go in their ways, and as a reward for this, you will pasture your kids beside the  princes of the nations, and so did Jeremiah say (31:20): Set up markers for yourself...put your heart to  the highway, etc.  <b> 9</b>  <b> At the gathering of the steeds of Pharaohs chariots have I silenced you, my beloved</b>  Heb.  לססתי  . This lammed is like the lammed of (Jer. 10:13): At the sound of  (לקול)  His giving a multitude of  waters, and like (above verse 3): At the fragrance of  (לריח)  your oils. At the gathering of many stee  ds, for I gathered my camps to go forth toward you in the chariots of Pharaoh to save you, as it is said  (Hab. 3:15): You trampled in the sea with your steeds, many steeds. There I silenced you, my  beloved. I silenced you from your cry, as it is written (Exod. 14:14): and you shall be silent. I saw  this in Aggadic works (Song Rabbah). Another explanation:  דמיתך רעיתי There I demonstrated to all  that you are my beloved. <b> steeds</b>  Heb.  לססתי , means a gathering of horses, and in the French language,  chevalchie, troop of horses, cavalcade.  דמיתך  is adesmay in Old French, like (Jud. 20:5): Me they  intended  (דמו)  to kill, for there I adorned you with beautiful ornaments.  <b> 10</b>  <b> Your cheeks are comely with rows</b>  rows of earrings and a golden forehead plate. <b> necklaces</b>  necklaces of gold with pearls strung on golden threads of the plunder of the sea.  <b> 11</b>  <b> We will make you rows of gold</b>  I and My tribunal decided before the arrival of Pharaoh that I  should entice him and strengthen his heart to pursue you with all the best of his hidden treasures, so  that we should make rows of golden ornaments for you. <b> with studs of silver</b>  that were already in your  possession, that you took out of Egypt, for the plunder at the sea was greater than the plunder in  Egypt. <b> studs</b>  silver objects studded and decorated with stripes and hues.  <b> 12</b>  <b> While the king was still at his table</b>  The congregation of Israel replies and says, All this is true.  You bestowed good upon me, but I repaid You with evil, for while the king was still at the table of his  wedding banquet... <b> my spikenard gave forth its fragrance</b>  This is instead of saying, gave forth its  stench. When the Shechinah was still at Sinai, I sinned with the Calf; Scripture describes it with an  expression of love, gave forth its fragrance, and did not write, stank, or became putrid, because  Scripture speaks euphemistically. [Rashi from Shab. 88b] (According to the Tosafists, it does not  say, stank, because of euphemism, and it does not say, abandoned its fragrance, because of love.)  <b> 13</b>  <b> A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me</b>  My beloved has become to me as one who has a bundle  of myrrh in his bosom, and he said to him, Here, take this bundle, which will give a more fragrant  scent than the first one that you lost. So was the Holy One, blessed be He, appeased by Israel for the  incident of the Calf and found them an atonement for their iniquity and said: Donate to the  Tabernacle, and let the gold of the Tabernacle atone for the gold of the Calf. <b> shall lie</b>  Even though I betrayed him, he said to dwell there. <b> between my breasts</b>  between the two  staves of the Ark.  <b> 14</b>   A cluster of henna-flowers Heb.  כפר . There is a spice called  כפר , like (below 4:12): Henna-  flowers  (כפרים)  with spikenard, and it is shaped like a sort of cluster. <b> in the vineyards of Ein-Gedi </b> The name of a place, and there it is common. I saw in an aggadah (Song Zuta) that those vineyards  produce fruits four or five times a year, and this is symbolic of the many atonements and forgivenesses  that the Holy One, blessed be He, forgave them for the many trials that they tried Him in the desert.  <b> 15</b>  <b> Behold, you are comely, my beloved</b>  I was ashamed of my sin, but He encouraged me with  appeasing words, saying, (Num. 14:20): I have forgiven according to your words, and you are most  fair, for your eyes are like doves; i.e., a bride whose eyes are uglyher entire body requires  examination but [a bride] whose eyes are beautiful, her body requires no examination. (Song Rabbah  4). The allegorical meaning is: I forgave you for your iniquity, and behold you are fair with [your  statement of] Let us do, and you are fair with [your statement of] Let us hear; fair with the deeds  of your forefathers and fair with your own deeds, because... <b> your eyes are like doves</b>  There are  righteous among you who clung to Me like a dove, which, as soon as it recognizes its mate, does not  abandon it to mate with another. Similarly, (Exod. 32:26): and all the sons of Levi gathered to  him, and they did not err with the Calf, and moreover, behold you are fair with the work of the  Tabernacle, as it is said (ibid. 39:43): and behold, they made it, etc. and Moses blessed them; behold  he praised them for that.  <b> 16</b>  <b> Behold, you are comely, my beloved, yea pleasant</b>  The beauty is not mine, but yours; you are the  comely one. <b> yea pleasant</b>  For You overlooked my transgression and caused Your Shechinah to rest in  our midst, and this is the praise of the descent of the fire (Lev. 9:24): and all the people saw and  shouted for joy. <b> also our couch is leafy</b>  Through your pleasantness, behold our couch is leafy with  our sons and with our daughters, all of whom gather to You here, as it is said (ibid. 8:4): and the  congregation gathered [to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting]. The Tabernacle is called a bed, as it  is said (below 3:7): Behold, the litter of Solomon, and the Temple is called a bed, as it is said  concerning Joash (II Chron. 22:11, II Kings 11:2): in the bed chamber which was in the House of  the Lord (ibid. 3), because they [the Sanctuaries] are the source of Israels fruitfulness and  procreation.  <b> 17</b>  <b> The beams of our houses are cedars</b>  This is the praise of the Tabernacle. <b> our corridors</b>  Heb.  רהיטנו . I do not know if this is a term referring to boards or a term referring to bars, but I do know  that also in the language of the Mishnah, we learned (Hag. 16a): The  רהיטים  of a persons house  testify against him.   <b> Chapter 2</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> a rose</b>  Heb.  חבצלת . This is a rose  (שושנה) . <b> a rose of the valleys</b>  This is prettier than the rose of the  mountains because it is always moist, since the sun has no strength there.  <b> 2</b>  <b> As a rose among the thorns</b>  which pierce it, but it remains constant in its beauty and its redness, so  is my beloved among the daughters. They entice her to pursue them to stray like them after strange  gods, but she remains firm in her faith.  <b> 3</b>  <b> As an apple tree among the trees of the forest</b>  When an apple tree is among trees that do not bear  fruit, it is more beloved than them all, for its fruit is good in both taste and fragrance. <b> among the sons</b>  among the young men. The allegory is that so is the Holy One, blessed be He, chosen  above all the gods. Therefore, in His shade I delighted and sat. The Midrash Aggadah (Song Rabbah),  [states]: This apple treeall flee from it because it has no shade. So did all the nations flee from the  Holy One, blessed be He, at the giving of the Torah, but I in His shade I delighted and sat.  <b> 4</b>  <b> He brought me to the banquet hall</b>  The Tent of Meeting, where the details and the explanations of  the Torah were given. <b> and his attraction to me [was symbolic of his] love</b>  And his gathering, that he  gathered me to him, that was love to me. I still remember his love.  ודגלו  is attrait in French.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Sustain me</b>  now as is the manner of the sick, with flagons of grape wine or with cakes of pure white  flour. <b> spread my bed</b>  Spread my bed around me with apples for a good fragrance, in the manner of the  sick, for I am sick for his love, for I thirst for Him here in my exile.  רפידה  is an expression of a couch,  like (Job 41:22): where he lies  (ירפד)  is gold upon the mire.  <b> 6</b>  <b> His left hand was under my head</b>  in the desert. <b> and his right hand would embrace me</b>  He  traveled a three-days journey; to search out a rest for them [as in Num. 10:33], and in the place of the  rest, He brought down manna and quails for them. All this I remember now in my exile, and I am sick  for His love.  <b> 7</b>  <b> I adjure you</b>  you nations. <b> by the gazelles or by the hinds</b>  that you will be abandoned and preyed  upon like gazelles and hinds. <b> that you neither awaken nor arouse the love</b>  that is between my  beloved and I, to change it and to alter it and beg me to be enticed to follow you. <b> while it is desirous </b> as long as it is thrust in my heart, and he desires me. <b> while it is desirous</b>  Heb.  עד , like (1:12): While  (עד)  the king was at his table, [i.e.,] while  (בעוד)  the king was still at his table. <b> awaken</b>  Heb.  תעירו , if you cause hatred, like (I Sam. 28:16): and has become your adversary  (ערך)  ; (Dan. 4:16): and its interpretation for Your foes  (לערך) . <b> nor contest</b>  Heb.  תעוררו , like (Keth. 13:  6): one who contests the ownership  (העורר)  of a field, chalon[j]טr in Old French, to contest, claim.  There are many aggadic midrashim but they do not fit the sequence of the topics, for I see that  Solomon prophesied and spoke about the Exodus from Egypt and about the giving of the Torah, the  Tabernacle, the entry to the Land, the Temple, the Babylonian exile, and the coming of the Second  Temple and its destruction.  <b> 8</b>  <b> The sound of my beloved</b>  The poet returns to earlier topics, like a person who was brief with his  words and later said, I did not tell you the beginning of the matter. He commenced by saying, The  king brought me into his chambers, but did not tell how He remembered them in Egypt with an  expression of affection, and now he returns and states: This attraction that I told you about, that my  beloved drew me and I ran after him, came about as follows: I had despaired of the redemption until  the completion of the four hundred years that were foretold [in the Covenant] between the Segments. <b> The sound of my beloved! Behold, he is coming</b>  before the end, as one skipping over the mountains  and jumping over the hills.  <b> 9</b>  <b> My beloved resembles a gazelle</b>  in the swiftness of his running, for he hastened to come like a  gazelle and like a fawn of the hinds.  עפר  is a young hind. <b> behold, he is standing, etc.</b>  I had expected  to remain detained for many more days, and behold, he informed me that he was standing and peering  from the windows of heaven at what was being done to me, as it is written (Exod. 3:7): I have indeed  seen the affliction of My people, etc.  <b> 10</b>  <b> raised his voice</b>  Heb.  ענה , an expression of answering and [sometimes] an expression of a loud  cry, and the following is the precedent for them all (Deut. 27:14): And the Levites shall raise their  voices  (וענו) . <b> and said to me</b>  through Moses. <b> Arise</b>  (Exod. 3:17): I will bring you up from the  affliction of Egypt.  <b> 11</b>  <b> behold, the winter has passed</b>  There is no difficulty in traveling now.  סתיו  is winter. The Targum  of  חרף  (Gen. 8:22) is  סתוא .  <b> 12</b>  <b> The blossoms have appeared in the land</b>  The days of summer are near, when the trees blossom  and the travelers enjoy seeing them. <b> the time of singing has arrived</b>  when the birds give forth their  song, and the sound is pleasant for travelers. <b> and the voice of the turtledove</b>  Heb.  התור . According to  its apparent meaning, this is a term referring to turtledoves and young pigeons. It is customary for the  birds to sing and chirp in the days of Nissan.  <b> 13</b>  <b> The fig tree has put forth its green figs</b>  [This is to be explained] according to its apparent  meaning. <b> and the vines with their tiny grapes</b>  When the blossom falls, and the grapes are separated  from one another, and each grape is recognizable by itself, it is called  סמדר . This entire episode,  according to its simple meaning, is an expression of the affection of enticement, i.e., a young man  appealing to his betrothed to follow him. So did my beloved do to me. <b> voice</b>  through Moses. <b> and said to me</b>  through Aaron. <b> Arise, my beloved</b>  Hurry (Exod. 11:2): and let  each man borrow from his neighbor. <b> [11] For behold, the winter has passed</b>  These are the four  hundred years. I skipped them by counting them from Isaacs birth. <b> the rain</b>  which is the hardship of  winter, is over and has gone away; i.e., eighty-six years of harsh slavery were decreed upon you, and  they have gone away. From the time that Miriam was born, the Egyptians intensified the bondage  upon Israel; therefore, she was called Miriam, because they made it bitter  (מר)  for them. <b> blossoms have appeared in the land</b>  Behold Moses and Aaron are prepared for you to fulfill all your  needs. <b> the time of singing has arrived</b>  you are destined to recite the Song by the Sea. <b> of the turtledove</b>  Heb.  התור , the great guide  (תיר) . Another explanation:  קול התור  means the voice  [announcing] that the time of your exodus from Egypt has arrived. [ תור  is explained to mean time, as  in Esther (2:12,15).] <b> [13] The fig tree put forth its green figs</b>  The time to bring the first fruits has  arrived, for you will enter the Land. <b> and the vines with their tiny grapes</b>  The time of the wine  libations has drawn near. Another explanation: The pious among you ripened and blossomed good  deeds before Me and emitted a pleasant scent. <b> arise</b>  Heb.  קומי לכי . A superfluous yud is written.  Arise to receive the Ten Commandments. Another explanation: The fig tree has put forth its green  figsThese are the transgressors of Israel, who perished during the three days of darkness. <b> vines with their tiny grapes gave forth their fragrance</b>  Those who remained of them repented and  were accepted. So it is interpreted in Pesikta (Rabbathi 15:11, 12; Pesikta dRav Kahana, p. 50).  <b> 14</b>  <b> My dove, in the clefts of the rock</b>  This is said concerning that time when Pharaoh pursued them  and overtook them camping by the sea with no avenue of escape before them because of the sea,  and they could not turn because of the wild beasts. What did they resemble at that time? A dove that  fled from a hawk and entered the clefts of the rocks, and a snake was hissing at her. Should she enter  within, there was the snake. Should she go outside, there was the hawk. The Holy One, blessed be  He, said to her, Show Me your appearance, the propriety of your deeds, to whom you turn in time  of trouble. <b> let me hear your voice</b>  (Exod. 14:10): And the Children of Israel cried out to the  Lord. <b> in the clefts of</b>  Heb.  בחגוי , in the clefts; this is a term referring to a breach, and similar to  this is (Ps. 107:27): They were frightened  (יחוגו)  and staggered; (Isa. 19:17): And the land of  Judah will be to Egypt for a dread  (לחגא) , and in the plural Scripture calls them  חגוי . Similarly, from  קץ  (end)  קצוי , and so, (II Sam. 10:4): and he cut off their garments  (מדויהם) . <b> steps</b>  Heb.  מדריגה  , יchelons, in French, steps. When they make a ditch around the towers and pour the earth from  above to raise the mound roundabout, they make it [in] many steps, one above the other. <b> coverture of the steps</b>  There are sometimes holes in them, and reptiles and birds enter therein.  <b> 15</b>  <b> Seize for us the foxes</b>  The Holy One, blessed be He, heard their voice, commanded the sea, and it  inundated them. That is the meaning of Seize for us these foxes, the little ones with the big ones,  for even the little ones were destroying the vineyards, when our vineyards were still with  סמדר , when  the grapes were tiny. When a Jewish woman gave birth to a male and hid him, the Egyptians entered  their houses and searched for the males, but the baby was concealed, and he was a year or two old. So  they would bring a baby from an Egyptian home; the Egyptian baby would speak, and the Jewish baby  would answer him from his hiding place; and they would seize him and cast him into the Nile. Now  why does he call them foxes? Just as the fox looks to turn around to flee, so did the Egyptians look  behind them, as it is written (Exod. 14:25): I shall flee from before Israel. <b> little foxes</b>  Heb.  שעלים . It  is written without a vav, because He punished them with water, which was measured with the gait  (בשעלו)  of the Omnipresent.  <b> 16</b>  <b> My beloved is mine, and I am his</b>  He demanded all His needs from me; He commanded only me:  Make a Passover sacrifice, hallow the firstborn, make a Tabernacle, sacrifice burnt offerings, and He  did not demand these things of any other nation. <b> and I am his</b>  All my needs I demanded of Him, and  not of other deities. <b> who grazes</b>  his flock among the roses, in a good, pleasant, and beautiful pasture.  <b> 17</b>  <b> Until the sun spreads</b>  This refers back to the preceding verse: My beloved is mine, and I am  his, until the time that the iniquity caused the sun to darken me in the heat of the day, and the heat to  intensify. <b> and the shadows flee</b>  We sinned with the Calf; we sinned with the Spies, and the shadows  fled, the merits that protected us. We broke off His yoke. <b> go around, liken yourself, my beloved</b>  I  caused him to leave me on mountains distant from me. <b> distant</b>  Heb.  בתר , an expression of separation  and distancing.   <b> Chapter 3</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> On my bed at night</b>  when I was troubled; when I sat in the dark for the entire thirty-eight years that  the Israelites were under reproach. <b> I sought him but I did not find him</b>  (Exod. 33:3): For I shall not  go up in your midst; (Deut. 1:42): for I am not in your midst.  <b> 2</b>  <b> I will arise now, etc., I will seek</b>  (Exod. 32:11): And Moses prayed; (ibid. verse 30): I will go up  to the Lord.  <b> 3</b>  <b> The watchmen who patrol the city found me</b>  Moses and Aaron. <b> soul loves</b>  What did you find in His mouth?  <b> 4</b>  <b> I had just passed them</b>  shortly before their separation from me, at the end of the forty years. <b> I found</b>  that He was with me in the days of Joshua to vanquish the thirty-one kings. <b> would not let him go</b>  I did not loosen my grasp from Him until I brought Him to the Tabernacle at  Shiloh because of all that He had done for me.  <b> 5</b>  <b> I adjure you</b>  [you] nations, while I am exiled among you. <b> that you neither awaken nor arouse</b>  my  beloveds love from me through seduction or enticement to forsake him, to turn from following him. <b> while it is desirous</b>  as long as I still desire his love.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Who is this coming up from the desert</b>  When I was traveling through the desert and the pillar of  fire and cloud were going before me and killing the snakes and scorpions and burning the thorns and  thistles to make a straight road, and the cloud and the smoke were ascending, the nations saw them,  and were astounded by my greatness, and they said, Who is this, i.e., How great is this one coming  up from the desert, etc.! <b> like columns of smoke</b>  Heb.  כתימרות , tall and erect as a palm tree  (תמר) . <b> perfumed with myrrh</b>  the cloud of incense which would rise straight up from the inner altar. <b> peddler</b>  a spice merchant who sells all types of spices. <b> powder</b>  Heb.  אבקת , since they crush it and  pound it as fine as dust  (אבק) .  <b> 7</b>  <b> Behold the litter of Solomon</b>  the Tent of Meeting and the Ark, which they carried in the desert. <b> sixty mighty men are around it</b>  sixty myriad surround it. <b> of the mighty men of Israel</b>  of those who  go out to the army, in addition to those under twenty [years of age] and those over sixty.  <b> 8</b>  <b> skilled in warfare</b>  the war of Torah, and similarly, the priests who surround it, who camp around  the Tabernacle, skilled in the order of their service. <b> each one with his sword</b>  his weapons. These are  the Masorah and the mnemonics, by which they preserve the correct version [of the Oral Law] and the  masorah (the traditional spelling and reading of the Scriptures), lest it be forgotten. <b> night</b>  lest they forget it, and troubles will befall them, and so Scripture says (Ps. 2:12): Arm  yourselves with the grain [of Torah] lest He become angry and you perish on the way.  <b> 9</b>  <b> King Solomon made himself a palanquin</b>  This refers to the Tent of Meeting, which was established  in the Tabernacle at Shiloh. He made Himself a crowning canopy for glory.  <b> 10</b>  <b> its couch of gold</b>  His couch and His dwelling were on the Ark cover, which is gold. <b> purple</b>  Heb.  מרכבו . This is the dividing curtain, which hangs and rides  (רוכב)  on poles from pillar to  pillar. <b> its interior inlaid</b>  arranged with a floor of lovethe Ark with an Ark cover, cherubim, and  Tablets. <b> from the daughters of Jerusalem</b>  Heb.  ירושלים . These are the Israelites, who fear  (יראים)  and are wholehearted  (שלמים)  with the Holy One, blessed be He.  <b> 11</b>  <b> 0 daughters of Zion</b>  Heb.  ציון . [This refers to] the sons, who are distinguished  (מצינין)  for Him  with circumcision, phylacteries, and ritual fringes. <b> him</b>  [This refers to] the Tent of Meeting, which is crowned with hues: blue, purple, and crimson. Rabbi  Nehunia said: Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai asked Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Jose, Perhaps you  heard from your father what the meaning of upon the crown with which his mother crowned  him is? He replied: This is a parable of a king who had an only daughter of whom he was very fond.  He could not stop loving her until he called her my daughter, as it is said (Ps. 45:11): Hearken,  daughter, and see. He could not stop loving her until he called her my sister, as it is said (below 5:  2): Open for me, my sister, my beloved. He could not stop loving her until he called her my  mother, as it is said (Isa. 51:4): Hearken to Me, My people, and My nation  (ולאומי) , bend your  ears. It is written:  ולאמי  [which can be read as  ולאמי , and to my mother]. Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai  stood up and kissed him on his head, etc. <b> on the day of his nuptials</b>  the day of the giving of the Torah,  when they crowned Him King for themselves and accepted His yoke. <b> heart</b>  This refers to the eighth day of the inauguration, when the Tabernacle in the desert was  dedicated.   <b> Chapter 4</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Behold, you are fair, my beloved</b>  He praised them and appeased them, and their sacrifices pleased  Him. <b> until the sun spreads</b>  that they sinned before Me in the days of Hophni and Phinehas. <b> are [like] doves</b>  Your hues and your appearance and your characteristics are like those of a dove,  which cleaves to its mate, and when they slaughter it, it does not struggle but stretches forth its neck;  so have you offered your shoulder to bear My yoke and My fear. <b> hair is like a flock of goats</b>  This praise is a paradigm of the praise of a woman beloved by her  bridegroom. Within your kerchief, your hair is beautiful and glistens with brilliance and whiteness like  the hair of white goats descending from the mountains, whose hair gleams in the distance. And in the  allegorical sense, [it is said of] the congregation of Israel that within your camps and your tents, even  the empty ones among you are as dear to Me as Jacob and his sons, who streamed down to descend  from Mount Gilead when Laban overtook them there. Another explanation: As those who mobilized  against Midian beyond the Jordan, which is in the land of Gilead, and this language is found in Midrash  Shir Hashirim. <b> within</b>  Heb.  מבעד . This is a term meaning within, for the majority of  בעד  in  Scripture refers to something that covers and shields against something else, like (Job 9:7): and He  sealed up  (ובעד)  the stars; (Jonah 2:7): the earthits bars are closed on me  (בעדי)  ; (Job 22:  13): Does He judge through  (הבעד)  the dark cloud? And  מבעד  is the thing that is within that  בעד .  Therefore, he says,  מבעד . <b> your kerchief</b>  Heb.  צמתך . An expression denoting a thing that confines  the hair so that it does not show, and this refers to a kerchief and ribbons. It is impossible to interpret  צמתך  as meaning a veil  (צמת) , where the tav is a radical, for were that so, it would have to be  punctuated with a dagesh when immediately preceding a hey, which makes it the feminine  possessive, or a vav, which makes it the masculine possessive, like the tav of  שבת , which, when  given to a female, (i.e., in the feminine possessive form), is punctuated with a dagesh, like (Hos. 2:  13): her festival[s], her new moon[s], and her Sabbath[s]  (שבתה) , and so for the masculine, (Num.  28:10): the burnt offering of a Sabbath in its Sabbath  (בשבתו) , but the tav of  צמתך , which is not  punctuated with a dagesh, perforce comes instead of a hey, and the name of the kerchief is  צמה ,  and when it is possessive, to be given to a male or female, the hey is converted to a tav without  a dagesh; e.g.  שפחה  becomes  שפחתו  or  שפחתה , and so  אמה  [becomes]  אמתו ,  אמתה  ;  ערוה  (nakedness)  [becomes]  ערותו ,  ערותה , and likewise, this one,  צמה  [becomes]  צמתו ,  צמתה ,  צמתי ,  צמתך . <b> streamed</b>  Heb.  שגלשו , that they became bald.  גבח  is rendered by the Targum as  גלוש . When the  animals descend from the mountain, the mountain becomes bald and bare of them.  <b> 2</b>  <b> Your teeth are like a flock of uniformly shaped [ewes]</b>  This praise too is in terms of a womans  beauty. <b> Your teeth</b>  are thin and white and arranged like wool and the order of a flock of ewes,  selected from the rest of the flocks by count and number, delivered to a clever and worthy shepherd  to be careful with their wool, for they make them into fine woolen garments, and they watch them  from the time of their birth, that the wool should not become soiled, and they wash them from day to  day. <b> all of whom are perfect</b>  Heb.  מתאימות , an expression of perfection, (Ps. 38:4): There is no  soundness  (מתם) , i.e., perfect, enterins in Old French, whole, perfect, sound. <b> bereavement</b>  There is  neither bereavement nor blemish among them. This example is given as symbolic of the mighty men  of Israel, who cut down and devour their enemies surrounding them with their teeth, and yet they  distance themselves from stealing from Israelites and from immoral acts, so that they should not  become sullied with sin. Now this praise was given concerning the twelve thousand men who  mobilized against Midian with count and number, of whom not one was suspected of committing  immoral acts, as it is written (Num. 31:49): and not a single man among us is missing. And they  even brought atonements for erotic thoughts, and they were not suspected of theft, for Scripture  attests for them, (ibid. verses 11f.): And they took all the booty and they brought it to Moses and to  Eleazar the priest, etc., and not one of them concealed even one cow or one donkey.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Your lips are like a scarlet thread</b>  beautiful to promise and to keep their promise, as the Spies did  to Rahab the harlot, i.e., they said to her, (Josh. 2:18): you shall bind this line of scarlet thread,  etc., and they kept their promise. <b> and your speech</b>  Heb.  ומדברך  your speech, and this is of the  structure of (Ezek. 33:30): who talk  (הנדברים)  about you beside the walls; (Mal. 3:16): Then the  God-fearing men spoke  (נדברו) , parlediz in Old French; words, speech, talk. <b> your temple</b>  Heb.  רקתך . This is the highest part of the face, called pomels or pomials, cheek-bones, [some editions  read: tenples or tanples, temples] next to the eyes. And in the language of the Talmud, it is called the  pomegranate of the face, and it resembles the split half of a pomegranate from the outside, which is  red and round. This is a praise in terms of a womans beauty, and our Sages explained the allegory to  mean: even your worthless ones ( ריקנים , lit. empty ones) are full of mitzvoth as a pomegranate. <b> within your kerchief</b>  Heb.  מבעד לצמתך , from within your kerchief.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Your neck is like the Tower of David</b>  An erect stature is beauty in a woman, and the allegorical  meaning is that [just as] the Tower of David, which is the Citadel of Zion, is a place of strength, a  tower, and a fortress, so is your neck. This is the Chamber of Hewn Stone, which was Israels strength  and fortification, and that tower was built as a model, and was built for beauty, so that everyone  should look at it to learn its forms and the beauty of its architecture, and the word  (לתלפיות)  is of the  grammatical structure of (Job 35:11): He teaches us  (מלפנו)  more than the beasts of the earth, and  the tav in  תלפיות  is like the tav in  תרמית  (guile) and  תבנית  (form). <b> a thousand shields hanging on it </b> It was the custom of the princes to hang their shields and their quivers on the walls of the towers. <b> quivers</b>  Heb.  שלטי , the quivers in which they place arrows, like (Jer. 51:11): Polish the arrows, fill  the quivers  (השלטים) , and similar to this is the Chamber of Hewn Stone, whence instruction goes  forth, for the Torah is a shield to Israel, (rendering  אלף המגן  as: the teaching that is a shield). It is also  possible to render  אלף המגן  as  מגן האלף , the shield of the thousand, alluding to (I Chron. 16:15): the  word He had commanded to the thousandth [ לאלף ] generation. <b> all the quivers of the mighty men</b>  We  find that disciples are symbolized by arrows and quivers, as is stated (Ps. 127:4f.): As arrows in the  hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of ones youth. Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with  them.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Your two breasts</b>  which nourish you. This refers to Moses and Aaron <b> of a gazelle</b>  It is customary for a gazelle to bear twins so that they are both identical, this one to that  one. Another explanation: <b> Your two breasts</b>  symbolize the Tablets. <b> the twins of a gazelle</b>  exactly  corresponding in one measure; the five commandments on this one (side of the Tablets, correspond to)  the five commandments on the other (side of the Tablets), each commandment corresponding to a  commandment. I [am the Lord your God] corresponds to You shall not murder, for the murderer  diminishes the semblance of the Holy One, blessed be He. You shall not have [any other gods before  Me] corresponds to You shall not commit adultery, for one who commits idolatry is like an  adulterous woman, who takes strangers instead of her husband. You shall not hear [the name of the  Lord your God in vain] corresponds to You shall not steal, for one who steals will ultimately swear  falsely. Remember [the Sabbath day to keep it holy] corresponds to You shall not bear [false  witness against your neighbor], for one who profanes the Sabbath testifies falsely against his Creator,  saying that He did not rest on the Sabbath of Creation. Honor [your father and mother] corresponds  to You shall not covet, for one who covets is destined to beget a son who slights him and honors one  who is not his father. <b> who graze</b>  their flocks among the roses and lead them in a tranquil and straight  path.  <b> 6</b>  <b> and the shadows flee</b>  That is the time of heat, the hottest time of the day. I will save you, and you  are pleasant to me. <b> the sun</b>  Heb.  היום , usually the day. This refers to the sun, and likewise, (Gen. 3:  8): in the direction of the sun  (לרוח היום) , and so, (Mal. 3:19): For lo, the sun  (היום)  comes, glowing  like a furnace, and when the sun spreads, I will go to Mount Moriah, to the everlasting Temple. [This  is] in Genesis Rabbah (55:7). i.e., When they will then sin before Me by profaning My sacred offerings  and by spurning My meal offerings in the days of Hophni and Phinehas (I Sam. 3:12-17), I will  withdraw from them and I will abandon this Tabernacle, and I will choose for Myself Mount Moriah,  the everlasting Temple, and there, You are all fair...and there is no blemish in you, and there I will  accept all your sacrifices.  <b> 8</b>  <b> With me from Lebanon, my bride</b>  When you will be exiled from this Lebanon, with Me you will  be exiled, for I will go into exile with you. <b> with me from Lebanon shall you come</b>  And when you  return from the exile, I will return with you, and also all the days of the exile, I will be distressed with  your distress. Therefore, he writes: with Me from Lebanon you shall come. When you are exiled  from this Lebanon, you shall come with Me, and he does not write: with Me to Lebanon you shall  come, denoting that from the time of your departure from here until the time of your arrival here, I  am with you wherever you go out and come in. <b> you shall look from the peak of Amanah</b>  When I  gather your dispersed ones, you will look and ponder what is the reward of your actions from the  beginning of your faith  (אמונה)  that you believed in Me (Tan. Beshallach 10), your following Me in  the desert and your travels and your encampments by My command, and your coming to the peak of  Senir and Hermon, which were the dens of lions, namely Sihon and Og (Song Rabbah, Mid. Zuta).  Another explanation: From the peak of Amanah. This is a mountain on the northern boundary of the  Land of Israel, named Amanah, and in the language of the Mishnah, the mountains of Amnon, and  [this is] Mount Hor, about which it says: (Num. 34:6): from the Great Sea you shall draw a line  extending to Mount Hor. When the exiles gather and arrive there, they will look from there and see  the boundary of the Land of Israel and the air of Israel, and they will rejoice and utter thanks.  Therefore, it says: You shall see from the peak of Amanah.  <b> 9</b>  <b> You have captivated my heart</b>  Heb.  לבבתני , you have drawn my heart to you. <b> eyes</b>  Of the many good characteristics that you possess, if you had only one, I would have loved you  dearly, and how much more so with all of them! And so,  באחד ענק מצורניך , with one of the links of  the necklaces of your adornments; these are the adornments of the commandments with which the  Israelites are distinguished. Another explanation:  באחד ענק with one of your forefathers; he was the  one who was special, and that is Abraham, who was called  ענק , a giant, the greatest man among the  Anakim (Josh. 14:15).  <b> 10</b>  <b> how much better is your love</b>  Every place where you showed Me affection is beautiful in my  eyes: Gilgal, Shiloh, Nob, Gibeon, and the everlasting Temple. That is what the Babylonian  (poet) composed: A resting place and other meeting places: resting place refers to Jerusalem,  and other meeting places refers to the place where the Shechinah met with Israel. <b> fragrance of your oils</b>  your good name.  <b> 11</b>  <b> flowing honey</b>  which is sweet. <b> Your lips drip</b>  the reasons of Torah. <b> garments</b>  the proper commandments that pertain to your garments: ritual fringes, the blue thread, the  priestly raiments, and the prohibition of shaatnez (the mingling of wool and linen).  <b> 12</b>  <b> A locked up garden</b>  This refers to the modesty of the daughters of Israel, who are not loose in  immoral actions. <b> a locked up spring</b>  Heb.  גל . This may be explained as a term referring to a fountain,  like (Josh. 15:19): upper springs  (גלת עליות) , and it may also be explained as a term referring to a  gate. This is an Aramaic expression; in the Talmud (Ber. 28a):  טרוקו גלי , lock the gates.  <b> 13</b>  <b> Your arid fields</b>  Dry land is called  בית השלחין . It must be continually irrigated, and a field watered  by rain is superior to it. Here he praises the arid field. Your arid fields are replete with all good like a  pomegranate orchard. This is symbolic of the smallest of Israel, who are moist with good deeds like a  pomegranate orchard. <b> henna and spikenard</b>  These are species of spices.  <b> 15</b>  <b> A garden fountain</b>  All this refers back to, your arid fields and he praises them (comparing them  to) a fountain that waters them, and this figure of speech symbolizes the immersions of purity which  the daughters of Israel immerse themselves. <b> and flowing streams from Lebanon</b>  from a place of  cleanliness, without the murkiness of mud.  <b> 16</b>  <b> Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind</b>  Since your fragrance and the beauty of your  dwellings is pleasing to me, I command the north and south winds to blow on your garden so that your  good fragrance should spread afar. And this figure of speech symbolizes the ingathering of the exiles  and from all the nations they will bring [them] as an offering to Jerusalem, and in the days of the  building [of the Temple], the Israelites will gather there for the festivals and for the pilgrimages, and  Israel shall reply, Let my beloved come to His garden. If You are there, all are there.   <b> Chapter 5</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> I have come to my garden</b>  in the days of the dedication of the Temple. <b> I have gathered</b>  Heb.  אריתי ,  I gathered, and it is Mishnaic language (Shev. 1:2): as much space as is required by a picker  (אורה)  and  his basket. It is also Biblical language (Ps. 80:13): and all wayfarers have plucked its fruit  (וארוה)  . This was stated in regard to the incense, for the princes burned private incense on the outside altar  and it was accepted. This is something that does not apply to later generations, and because of this, it  is stated: I have eaten my sugar cane with my sugar. There is honey that grows in canes, as it is  stated (I Sam. 14:27): into the sugar canes  (ביערת הדבש) , and  יערת  is a term referring to canes [or  reeds], as it is stated (Exod. 2:3): and she placed [it] in the reeds  (בסוף) , [which Onkelos renders:]  ושויתה ביערא , and the sugar is sucked out and the wood is discarded. But I, out of great love, ate my  יער  with my honey: I ate the cane with the sugar, the inedible with the edible, signifying the freewill  incense, and likewise, the he-goat sin offering that the princes sacrificed, although a sin offering is not  sacrificed as a freewill offering, but I accepted them on that day. <b> I have drunk my wine</b>  These are the  libations. <b> with my milk</b>  They were sweeter and clearer than milk. <b> Eat, friends</b>  in the Tent of Meeting.  [These were] Aaron and his sons, and in the everlasting Temple, all the priests. <b> abundantly, beloved ones</b>  These are the Israelites who ate the flesh of the peace offerings that they  offered up for the dedication of the altar.  <b> 2</b>  <b> I sleep</b>  When I was confident and tranquil in the First Temple, I despaired of worshipping the Holy  One, blessed be He, as one who sleeps and slumbers. <b> but my heart is awake</b>  This is the Holy One,  blessed be He. So is this explained in the Pesikta (Rabbathi, ch. 15). <b> but my heart is awake</b>  The Holy  One, blessed be He, Who is (Ps. 73:26): the Rock of my heart and my portion, is awake to guard me  and to favor me. <b> Hark! My beloved is knocking</b>  He causes His Shechinah to rest upon the prophets  and He admonishes through them by sending them betimes. <b> Open for me</b>  Do not cause Me to  withdraw from you. <b> for my head is full of dew</b>  A term referring to a man who comes at night,  knocking on the door of his beloved. He says thus, Because of love for you, I have come at night at  the time of dew or rain, and the allegory is that, My head is full of dew because I am full of goodwill  and satisfaction with Abraham your father, whose deeds pleased Me like dew, and behold, I come to  you, loaded with blessings and the payment of reward for good deeds if you return to Me. <b> with the drops of the night</b>  In My hands there are also many categories of types of retribution, to  exact retribution from those who forsake Me and anger Me. Dew is an expression connoting pleasure. <b> the drops of the night</b>  the rains of the night, which represent hardship and weariness.  רסיסי  is the  Targum of  רביבים . (Deut. 32:2): and like drops  (וכרביבים)  on the grass, is translated as  וכרסיסי  מלקושא , drops of the last rain of the season. Locks are bunches of hair stuck together, called flozels,  curls, locks, and because Scripture adopted an expression of dew and rain, it adopted an expression of  a head and locks, for it is usual for dew and rain to stick to the hair and locks. Both dew and drops  of the night may also be explained favorably, viz. the reward for precepts that are easy to perform,  like dew, and the reward for precepts that are difficult as the hardship of the drops of the night.  <b> 3</b>  <b> I have taken off my tunic</b>  i.e., I have already accustomed myself to other ways; I can no longer  return to You, as it is stated (Jer. 44:18): But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of  heaven, etc., for these ways were proper in their eyes, and the expression, I have taken off my  tunic...I have bathed my feet, is the language of an adulterous wife, who does not wish to open the  door for her husband. And since Scripture commenced with the language of, I sleep...Hark! My  beloved is knocking, it concludes with an expression apropos to an expression of knocking at the  door at the time of retiring to sleep at night.  <b> 4</b>  <b> My beloved stretched forth his hand from the hole</b>  which is beside the door, and I saw his hand,  and the stirring of my insides turned within me to return to his love and to open for him.  <b> 5</b>  <b> I arose to open for my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh</b>  wholeheartedly and with a  desiring soul, as one who adorns herself to endear herself to her husband with a pleasant scent. <b> flowing myrrh</b>  with a fragrance that flows and spreads to all parts.  <b> 6</b>  <b> but my beloved had hidden and was gone</b>  Heb.  חמק , was hidden and concealed from me, like  (below 7:2): the curves  (חמוקי)  of your thighs, the hidden places of your thighs, because the thigh  is hidden. [Also] (Jer. 31:21): How long will you hide  (תתחמקי) , will you hide and cover yourself  because of the shame that you betrayed Me? <b> my soul went out when he spoke</b>  for he said, I will not  come into your house because at first you did not wish to open. <b> found me</b>  and apprehend the thieves who prowl at night. <b> they smote me and wounded me</b>  They  inflicted a wound upon me. Every [instance of]  פצע  is an expression of a wound [inflicted] by a  weapon, navredure in Old French, a wound. <b> my jewelry</b>  Heb.  רדידי . My jewelry that was hammered  and beaten, upon me, and the entire episode is an expression of a wife of ones youth who bewails the  husband of her youth and searches for him. And this is the allegorical meaning: <b> stretched forth his hand from the hole</b>  when I said, I have bathed my feet, and I will not open for  You, and I will not repent of the idolatry that I have chosen. <b> stretched forth his hand</b>  and  demonstrated His vengeance in the days of Ahaz, and He brought upon him the army of the king of  Aram (II Chron. 28:5f): and they smote him and captured from him a great captivity, etc. And Pekah  the son of Remaliah slew in Judah one hundred and twenty thousand in one day. <b> stirred because of him</b>  Hezekiah his son came and repented with all his heart to seek the Holy One,  blessed be He, and his entire generation was wholehearted; there never arose a generation in Israel like  them, as is delineated in [the chapter entitled]  חלק  (Sanh. 94b): They searched from Dan to Beersheba  and did not find an ignoramus, from Gebeth to Antioch, and did not find a man or woman who was not  well versed in the laws of ritual contamination and purity, and this is the meaning of, my hands  dripped with myrrh, etc. It is also stated regarding Josiah (II Kings 23:25): Now before him there  was no king like him, etc., for he saw the retribution that had come upon Manasseh and upon Amon,  to fulfill the words, he stretched forth his hand from the hole, and my insides stirred because of  him. <b> [6] I opened for my beloved, but my beloved had hidden and was gone</b>  He did not nullify His  decree, as it is stated regarding Hezekiah (Isa. 39:6f): Behold a time shall come when everything in  your palace, etc. shall be carried off to Babylonia. And...[some] of your sons...whom you shall  beget. These are Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, and also [as it is stated] concerning Josiah,  through Huldah the prophetess (II Kings 22:16): Behold, I bring calamity upon this place and upon its  inhabitants, etc. And Scripture states: (ibid. 23:25ff): Now, before him there was no king like him...  Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn back from His great wrath, for His wrath was kindled against  Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked Him. And the Lord said: I will  remove Judah too from before Me as I have removed Israel, and I will reject this city. <b> out when he spoke</b>  It left me when He spoke this word. <b> I sought him, but found him not</b>  Now if you  ask: Was not Jeremiah standing and prophesying during the days of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah, (Mal. 3:  7): Return to Me, and I will return to you? This was not to nullify the decree, but to mitigate the  punishment and to prepare their kingdom for the time when they would return from the exile, to plant  them without being uprooted and to build it without being demolished.  <b> 7</b>  <b> The watchmen...found me</b>  Nebuchadnezzar and his armies. <b> who patrol the city</b>  to wreak the  vengeance of the Omnipresent. <b> took my jewelry</b>  the Temple. <b> the watchmen of the walls</b>  Even the  ministering angels, who were guarding its walls, as it is stated (Isa. 62:6): On your walls, O  Jerusalem, etc. They ignited the fire upon it, as it is written (Lam. 1:13): From above He has  hurled fire, etc.  <b> 8</b>  <b> I adjure you</b>  [You] heathens, Nebuchadnezzars men, who saw Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah  submitting themselves to the fiery furnace, and Daniel to the lions den because of prayer, and  Mordecais generation in the days of Haman... <b> if you find my beloved</b>  in the future, on judgment day,  for He will request you to testify about me, as it is stated (Isa. 43:9): Let them p resent their  witnesses, that they may be deemed just. <b> what will you tell him</b>  you will testify on my behalf that  because of love for Him, I suffered harsh tortures among you. Let Nebuchadnezzar come and testify...  let Eliphaz and Zophar and all the prophets of the heathens [come] and testify about me that I fulfilled  the Torah.  <b> 9</b>  <b> What is your beloved more than another beloved</b>  This is what the nations were asking  Israel, What is it about your God more than all the other gods, that you allow yourselves to be burned  and hanged because of Him? <b> that you have so adjured us</b>  to testify before Him concerning your  love.  <b> 10</b>  <b> My beloved is white</b>  Heb.  צח , white, like (Lam. 4:7): they were whiter  (צחו)  than milk. <b> ruddy</b>  I will first explain the entire section according to its simple meaning, i.e., the praise of the  beauty of a young man, when he is white and his face is ruddy. <b> surrounded by myriads</b>  surrounded  by many armies; His armies are many. Many myriads are called  רבבה , as it is said: (Ezek. 16:  7): Myriads  (רבבה)  like the plants of the field have I made you.  <b> 11</b>  <b> His head</b>  glistens like the finest gold.  כתם  is a term referring to the treasures of kings which they  store in their treasure houses, and similarly, (Lam. 4:1): [How] changed is the fine gold jewelry  (הכתם) , and similarly, (Job 31:24): and to jewelry  (לכתם)  I said, My confidence, and  similarly, (Prov. 25:12): and jewelry of finest gold  (כתם) . <b> his locks are curled</b>  Heb.  תלתלים , an  expression of hanging  (תלויים) , pendeloys in Old French, (locks of hair) hanging. <b> black as a raven </b> All these are beauty for a young man.  <b> 12</b>  <b> His eyes are like doves beside rivulets of water</b>  By rivulets of water his eyes are as beautiful as  the eyes of doves. Rivulets of water are beautiful to behold, and the young men go there to swim, so  does the poet praise the eyes of my beloved. When he gazes upon the rivulets of water, they  resemble the beauty of the eyes of doves. <b> bathing in milk</b>  the eyes of my beloved in milk. <b> fitly set</b>  All  this is an expression of beauty, neither protruding too much nor sunken, but set on  מלאת , their sockets.  (Other editions: the eye according to the socket.) The literal meaning parallels the allegorical meaning.  And it is a term used to refer to anything made to fit a socket which is made for it as a base, like  (Exod. 25:7): stones to be fit  (מלאים)  ; (ibid. 28:17): And you shall set  (ומלאת)  into it settings of  (מלאת)  stones.  <b> 13</b>  <b> His jaws are like a bed of spice</b>  in those beds are spice plants. <b> growths of aromatic plants</b>  Heb.  מגדלות מרקחים , aromatic plants, growths of aromatic plants which are compounded with the art of an  apothecary.  <b> 14</b>  <b> wheels of gold</b>  Heb.  גלילי זהב , like wheels of gold. <b> set with chrysolite</b>  Every term referring to  the setting of a precious stone in gold is called  מלאת . <b> a block</b>  Heb.  עשת , an expression of (Jer. 5:  28): They became fat; they became thick  (עשתו) . A thick mass is called  עשת , masse in French, a  mass. <b> ivory</b>  Heb.  שן , from the bones of the elephant. <b> overlaid with sapphires</b>  Heb.  מעלפת , adorned  and decorated with sapphires, an expression of (Gen. 38:14)  ותתעלף , which the Targum renders:  ואתקנת  , and she adorned herself.  <b> 15</b>  <b> His legs are</b>  as pillars of marble, founded upon sockets of fine gold. <b> pillars of marble</b>  Heb.  שש ,  pillars of marble,  שיש , and a similar word appears in Megillath Esther (1:6): on silver rods and marble  (שש)  columns, and his appearance is as tall as the cedars of the Lebanon. <b> chosen as the cedars</b>  chosen  among the sons as the cedar among the other trees.  <b> 16</b>  <b> His palate is sweet</b>  His words are pleasant. <b> this is my beloved</b>  This is the likeness of my beloved,  and this is the likeness of my friend, and because of all these things I have become ill for his love. The  allegorical meaning, symbolizing the Holy One, blessed be He, is as follows: <b> [10] My beloved is white </b> to whiten my iniquities. Clear and white; when He appeared at Sinai, He appeared as an old man,  teaching instructions, and so, when He sits in judgment (Dan. 7:9): His garment was like white snow,  and the hair of His head was like clean wool. <b> and ruddy</b>  to exact retribution upon His enemies, as it  is stated (Isa. 63.2): Why is Your clothing red? <b> surrounded by myriads</b>  Many armies encompass  Him. <b> [11] His head is as the finest gold</b>  The beginning of His words shone like finest gold, and so  Scripture says (Ps. 119:130): The commencement of Your words enlightens. The commencement  of, I am the Lord your God showed them first that He has the right of sovereignty over them, and  He then issued His decrees upon them. <b> his locks are curled</b>  Heb.  קוצותיו תלתלים . Upon every  point  (קוץ וקוץ)  [of the letters of the Sepher Torah] were heaps of heaps  (תלי תלים)  of halachoth. <b> black as a raven</b>  because it was written before Him in black fire on white fire. Another explanation:  His locks were curled when He appeared on the sea, appearing like a young man mightily waging war. <b> [12] His eyes are like doves beside rivulets of water</b>  Like doves, whose eyes look toward their  dovecotes, so are His eyes on the synagogues and study halls, for there are the sources of Torah,  which is compared to water. <b> bathing in milk</b>  When they look into the judgment, they clarify the law  in its true light, to justify the just, to give him what he deserves, and to condemn the guilty, to repay his  [evil] way upon his head. <b> fitly set</b>  on the fullness of the world. They wander over the entire earth,  gazing upon good and evil. Another explanation: Torah scholars, whom the Holy One, blessed be He,  makes as eyes to illuminate the world, just as the eyes illuminate for man; like doves that wander from  dovecote to dovecote to seek their food, so do they go from the study hall of one sage to the study hall  of another sage, to seek the explanations of the Torah. <b> by rivulets of water</b>  in the study halls, which  are the sources of the water of Torah. <b> bathing in milk</b>  Since he calls them eyes, and the eye  (עין)  is a  feminine noun, bathing  (רוחצות)  is in the feminine conjugation. They cleanse themselves with the milk  of Torah and whiten (clarify) its mysteries and enigmas. <b> fitly set</b>  They resolve the matters  appropriately. Another explanation: His eyes  עיניו , [like]  עניניו  His topics. The sections of the  Torah, the halachoth, and the Mishnayoth are like doves which are comely in their walk beside the  rivulets of water, [i.e.,] in the study halls; bathing in milk, made clear as milk, as I have explained. <b> His jaws</b>  the commandments of Mount Sinai, for He showed them a friendly and smiling countenance. <b> his lips are like roses</b>  the commandments (lit. statements) that He spoke in the Tent of Meeting,  which are for appeasement and for atonement and for a pleasant fragrance: the law of the sin offering,  the guilt offering, the meal offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering. <b> [14] His hands</b>  the  Tablets, which He gave with His right hand, which are the work of His hands. <b> wheels of gold</b>  These  are the commandments, about which it is said (Ps. 19:11): They are to be desired more than gold, yea  more than much fine gold. Said Rabbi Joshua the son of Nehemiah: They were made miraculously.  They were of sapphire, yet they could be rolled (Song Rabbah, Tanch. Ki Thissa 26). Another  explanation: because they bring about (lit. roll) much good to the world. <b> set with chrysolite</b>  He  included the 613 commandments in the Decalogue. <b> his abdomen is [as] a block of ivory</b>  This is the  Priestly Code (Leviticus), placed in the center of the Five Books of the Pentateuch, like the intestines,  which are set in the middle of the body. <b> [as] a block of ivory, overlaid with sapphires</b>  It appears as  smooth as a block of ivory, and is set with many details [derived from] similar wordings, general  principles, and inferences from minor to major. <b> [15] founded upon sockets of fine gold</b>  Said Rabbi  Eleazar Hakkappar: This pillar has a capitol above and a base below. Said Rabbi Samuel the son of  Gadda: The sections of the Torah have a capitol above and a base below, and they are juxtaposed  before them and after them, e.g., the sections of the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee year, [are  juxtaposed to] (Lev. 25:14): And if you transact a sale, to teach you how severe the dust (i.e., a  minor infraction) of the Sabbatical Year is, as appears in Tractates Bava Metzia and Arachin (30b).  Also, like (Num. 27:16): May the Lord...appoint a man over the congregation, and (ibid. 29:  2): Command...My sacrifice, My bread. Before you command Me about My children, command  them about Me (Sifrei Num. 27:23), and similarly, many [such instances]. Therefore, it is stated: His  legs are [as] pillars of marble, founded, etc. <b> his appearance is like the Lebanon</b>  One who reflects  and ponders over His words finds in them blossoms and sprouts, like a forest which blooms. So are the  words of Torahwhoever meditates over them constantly finds new explanations in them. <b> chosen </b> Heb.  בחור , chosen as the cedars, which are chosen for building and for strength and height. <b> palate is sweet</b>  His words are pleasant, e.g. (Lev. 19:28): And you shall not make a wound in your  flesh for one who has died...I am the Lord, faithful to pay reward. Is there a palate sweeter than this?  Do not wound yourselves, and you will receive reward. (Ezek. 33:19): And when a wicked man  repents of his wickedness and performs justice and righteousness, he shall live because of  them. Iniquities are accounted to him as merits. Is there a palate sweeter than this?   <b> Chapter 6</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Where has your beloved gone</b>  The nations taunt and provoke Israel, Where has your Beloved  gone? Why has He left you abandoned like a widow? <b> Where has your beloved turned</b>  When He  returned and caused His spirit to rest on Cyrus, and sanctioned the rebuilding of the Temple, and  they commenced to build, they came and said to them, Where has your Beloved turned? If He is  returning to you, we will seek Him with you, as is stated (Ezra 4:1f): Now the adversaries of Judah  and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a Temple, etc. And they approached  Zerubbabel, etc.: Let us build with you, for like you we seek your God, etc. But their intention was  for evil, in order to stop the work. And they replied to them:  <b> 2</b>  <b> My beloved has gone down to his garden</b>  He commanded us to build His Temple, and He will be  there with us. <b> to the spice beds</b>  to the place where the incense is burned. <b> to graze in the gardens</b>  And  further, He went down to pasture His flocks in the gardens where they were scattered, i.e., those who  did not come up from the exile. He causes His Shechinah to rest upon them in the synagogues and in  the study halls. <b> and to gather roses</b>  He listens and hearkens to those who speak of His Torah, to  collect their merits and to inscribe them in a memorial book before Him, as it is stated (Mal. 3:  16): Then the God-fearing men spoke...[and a book of remembrance was written before  Him...] Now, concerning your request to seek with us and to build with us, I am my Beloveds, but  you are not His, and you shall not build with us, as it is stated (Ezra 4:3): It is not for you and for us  to build a House for our God, and Scripture states further (Neh. 2:20): and you have no portion or  right or memorial in Jerusalem.  <b> 3</b>  <b> who grazes among the roses</b>  who pastures his flocks in a calm and goodly pasture.  <b> 4</b>  <b> You are fair, my beloved, as Tirzah</b>  And the Holy One, blessed be He, praises her for this: You are  fair, my beloved, when you are desirable  (רצויה)  to me. So it is expounded in Sifrei (Deut. 6:9). <b> comely</b>  are you now as at first in Jerusalem. <b> awesome as the bannered legions</b>  the legions of angels. I  will cast your awe upon them (upon your adversaries) so that they should not wage war and stop you  from the work, as is stated in Ezra (ch. 5).  <b> 5</b>  <b> Turn away your eyes from me</b>  as a young man whose betrothed is dear and sweet to him, and her  eyes are comely, and he says to her, Turn away your eyes from me, for when I see you, my heart  becomes haughty and proud, and my spirit becomes arrogant, and I cannot resist. <b> me haughty</b>  Heb.  הרהיבני . They made my heart arrogant, like (Ps. 90:10): but their pride  (ורהבם)  is  toil and pain; (Isa. 30:7): They are haughty  (רהב) , idlers, asoijer in Old French, to make proud. The  allegorical meaning is as follows: The Holy One, blessed be He, said: In this Temple, it is impossible to  restore to you the Ark, the Ark cover, and the cherubim, which made Me proud in the First Temple, to  show you great affection, until you betrayed Me. <b> your hair is like a flock of goats</b>  in the small, the  tender, and the slight ones among you, there is much praise.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes</b>  The officers and the mighty men among you are all [devoted to]  goodness. <b> like a flock of ewes</b>  This ewe is entirely devoted to holiness: its wool is for the blue thread,  its flesh for a sacrifice, its horns for shofaroth, its thighs for flutes, its intestines for harps, its hide for a  drum; but the wicked were likened to dogs, for they have nothing to offer to holiness.  <b> 8</b>  <b> There are sixty queens</b>  Abraham and his descendants (Song Zuta). The sons of Keturah are sixteen.  Ishmael and his sons are thirteen. Isaac and his sons are three. The sons of Jacob are twelve. The sons  of Esau are sixteen, thus totaling sixty. And if you say that Timna should be excluded because she was  a woman, then count Abraham in the number. <b> and eighty concubines</b>  Noah and his sons until  Abraham, all the generations of those who left the Ark (Song Zuta)you will find them to be eighty.  And just as the queens, who are the kings wives, are superior in greatness to the concubines, so were  Abraham and his descendants of great esteem, and superior in their esteem over everyone, as you will  see. Hagar was the daughter of kings [and became Sarahs maidservant (Gen. Rabbah 45:1)]. Timna  was the daughter of rulers and became Esaus concubine (ibid. 82:15), and Scripture says (Gen. 14:  17): to the Valley of Shaveh  (שוה) , etc. They all unanimously  (השוו)  resolved to make Abraham  king over them. <b> and innumerable maidens</b>  All these were divided into many families.  <b> 9</b>  <b> My dove is but one</b>  And of all of them, one is My chosen one as a perfect dove, for she is  wholehearted with her mate. <b> she is one to her mother</b>  to her assembly. Many controversies exist in  the study halls. All of them stem from the desire to understand the Torah in a well founded manner  and according to its true meaning. <b> she is the pure one of she who bore her</b>  Jacob perceived that  perfect bed without any blemish, and he thanked and praised the Omnipresent, as it is said (Gen. 47:  31): And Israel prostrated himself because of the esteem of the bed. <b> daughters saw her</b>  Israel in her  greatness. <b> and they lauded her</b>  And what was their praise?  <b> 10</b>  <b> Who is this who looks forth</b>  upon us. [Looking] from a high place to a low place is called  השקפה .  So is the Temple higher than all lands. <b> like the dawn</b>  which progressively lights up little by little; so  were the Israelites in the Second Temple. In the beginning, Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah, but  not a king, and they were subjugated to Persia and to Greece, and afterwards, the house of the  Hasmoneans defeated them and they became kings. <b> awesome as the bannered legions</b>  awesome  among the mighty men as the bannered legions of kings. All this the Holy One, blessed be He, praises  the congregation of Israel, You are fair, my beloved, as Tirzah, and the entire matter until here.  <b> 11</b>  <b> I went down to the nut garden</b>  This too is included in the words of the Shechinah: Behold I came  to this Second Temple to you. <b> to see the green plants of the valley</b>  what moisture of good deeds I  would see in you. <b> whether the vine had blossomed</b>  whether you caused Torah scholars, scribes, and  teachers of Mishnah to blossom. <b> the pomegranates were in bloom</b>  [This refers to] those who fulfill  the commandments, who are full of merits. Why were the Israelites compared to a nut? Just as this  nutall you see is wood, and what is inside is not discernible, and you crack it and find it full of  sections of edible food, so are the Israelites modest and humble in their deeds, and the students among  them are not discernible, and they do not boast by announcing their [own] praise. But if you examine  him, you find him full of wisdom. There are many additional homiletic interpretations of this matter.  Just as if this nut falls into the mud, its interior does not become sullied, so are the Israelites exiled  among the nations and smitten with many blows, but their deeds are not sullied.  <b> 12</b>  <b> I did not know</b>  The congregation of Israel laments: I did not know to beware of sin, that I should  retain my honor and my greatness, and I erred in the matter of groundless hatred and controversy,  which intensified during the reign of the Hasmonean kings, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, until one of  them brought the kingdom of Rome and received the kingship from their hand and became their  vassal, and since then, my soul made me to be chariots, that the nobility of other nations ride upon me. <b> a princely people</b>  Heb.  עמי נדיב  like:.  עם נדיב , the yud being superfluous, like the yud of  (Deut. 33:16): the One Who took up His abode  (שכני)  in the thornbush; (Gen. 31:39): stolen  (גנבתי)  by day; (Lam. 1:1): populous  (רבתי עם) . <b> my soul made me</b>  I myself appointed them  over me, as it is stated (Jer. 13:21): and you accustomed them to be princes over you as head.   <b> Chapter 7</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Return, return, O Shulammite</b>  They say to me, Return from following the Omnipresent. <b> Shulammite</b>  Heb.  השולמית , the one who is perfect in your faith with Him, return, return to us.  and  let us gaze upon you  נחזה . We will appoint from you governors and rulers, like (Exod. 18:  21): And you shall appoint  (תחזה)  from all the people. So did Rabbi Tanhuma interpret it (Bamidbar  11). Another explanation for and we will gaze upon you: We will ponder what greatness to give you,  but she says, What will you see for the Shulammite? What greatness can you allot me, that will  equal my greatness, or even the greatness of the divisions of the dances of the encampments in the  desert?  <b> 2</b>  <b> How fair are your feet in sandals</b>  They say to her: We want you to cleave to us because of the  beauty and the esteem that we saw in you when you were still beautiful. <b> How fair are your feet</b>  in the  festive pilgrimages, O daughter of princes! <b> The curves of your thighs are like jewels</b>  A collection of  gold jewels is called  חלי כתם , al chali in Arabic. And our Sages interpreted this as referring to the holes  of the foundations [of the altar] for the libations, which were created during the Six Days of Creation,  round as a thigh. <b> like jewels</b>  Heb.  חלאים , like the hollow of  (חולית)  a pit. <b> craftsman</b>  [They are] the [work of the] hands of the Holy One, blessed be He. [See] Tractate Succah  (49a). <b> craftsman</b>  Heb.  אמן , like  אומן . In the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, the Israelites praise  Him from top to bottom. They commence, so to speak, from His head is as finest gold, and  progressively descend to His legs are as pillars of marble, since they come to appease Him, to draw  down His Shechinah from the heavenly abodes to the earthly abodes. He, however, counts their  praises from bottom to top: How fair are your feet! and He progressively counts until, Your head  upon you is like Carmel, until He comes to draw them to Him.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Your navel is [like] a round basin</b>  Your navel is like a basin of clear water with which they wash,  and it [the basin] is made of marble, which in Arabic is called sahar. He compares it to a round basin  because the navel is shaped like a round hole. This praise does not refer to a womans beauty as the  above praise does, for [in] the above, her beloved praises her, but here, her companions praise her  about her deeds, saying: You are worthy to join us. The image symbolizes the Chamber of Hewn  Stone, which is situated in the navel of the world. <b> where no mixed wine is lacking</b>  No beverage  will ever cease [to be found] there; he wishes to say that no words of instruction will cease or end  from there. <b> your belly is [like] a stack of wheat</b>  which everyone needs. <b> fenced in with roses</b>  fenced  and hedged about with roses. A light fence suffices her, and no one breaches it to enter. For example,  a bridegroom enters the nuptial canopy, his heart longing for the nuptials and for the love of his  marriage. When he comes to cohabit with her, she says to him, I have perceived a drop of blood like  [the size of] a mustard seed. He turns his face the other way. Now no snake bit him, nor did a  scorpion sting him. [Similarly,] one passes by on the road and sees freshly ripened fruit at the top of  the fig trees. He stretches out his hand to take [them]. They tell him, These belong to owners, and he  too withdraws his hand because of [the prohibition] of theft. This is the meaning of she is fenced in  with roses.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Your two breasts</b>  the two Tablets. Another explanation: the king and the high priest.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Your neck</b>  the Temple and the altar, which are erect and tall, and the Chamber of Hewn Stone,  which is also there, made for strength and for a shield, like an ivory tower. <b> your eyes</b>  are like pools  (ברכות)  in Heshbon, through which water flows. So are your eyes by the gate of the multitudes. Your  sages, when they sit in the gates of Jerusalem, the city of multitudes, and engage in the computation  (חשבון)  of the seasons and the signs of the zodiactheir wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the  peoples flow like pools of water. Alternatively, we can explain  ברכות בחשבון  to mean doves, and this is  a Mishnaic usage: If one buys the doves of a dovecote, he must let the first brood  (בריכה)  fly away;  covedes in Old French, covey, brood. <b> your face is as the tower of Lebanon</b>  Heb.  אפך . I cannot  explain this to mean a nose, either in reference to its simple meaning or in reference to its allegorical  meaning, for what praise of beauty is there in a nose that is large and erect as a tower? I say, therefore,  that  אפך  means a face. Now the reason he uses the singular and does not say  אפיך , is that he speaks  of the forehead, which is the main recognizable feature of the face, as it is said (Isa. 3:9): The  recognition of their faces testified against them. And you should know, for he progressively praises  them from bottom to topYour eyes are [like] pools in Heshbon, and after them the forehead, and  so do the nations praise (Ezek. 3:8): and your forehead is strong against the forehead of all who  come to harm you and entice you. <b> as the tower of Lebanon, facing towards Damascus</b>  I saw [the  following] in the Midrash (Zuta): This is the house of the Lebanon forest, which King Solomon made.  Whoever stood on it could look and count how many houses there were in Damascus. Another  explanation: Your face looks towards Damascus; looks forward to the coming of the gates of  Jerusalem until Damascus, for it is destined to expand as far as Damascus.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Your head upon you is like Carmel</b>  These are the tephillin [phylacteries] of the head, about  which it is said (Deut. 28:10): And all the peoples of the world will see that the name of the Lord is  called upon you, and they will fear you. That is their strength and their fear, like a rock of the  mountains, and the Carmel is the most prominent of the mountains. <b> head</b>  The braided hair of your Nazirites are as beautiful with commandments as braided purple  [ropes]. <b> and the braided locks of your head</b>  Heb.  ודלת ראשך , because the braid is lifted up  (מדלת)  on  the highest part of the head. <b> the king is bound in the tresses</b>  The name of the Omnipresent is bound  in the locks, as is stated (Num. 6:7): The crown of his God is on his head. <b> tresses</b>  Heb.  רהטים ,  courants in French; currents, windings [tresses]. This is what they call the fringes of the sashes, with  which they tie the girdles. Another explanation of  מלך אסור ברהטים : The Holy One, blessed be He,  is bound with love to the commandments and to the swiftness with which you run before Him.  <b> 7</b>  <b> How fair and how pleasant you are</b>  After having praised each limb in detail, he includes  everything in a general statement: How fair you are in your entirety, and how pleasant you are, to  cleave to you with a love that is proper to delight in.  <b> 8</b>  <b> This, your stature, is like a palm tree</b>  We saw the beauty of your stature in the days of  Nebuchadnezzar, when all the nations were kneeling and falling before the image, but you stood as  erect as this palm tree. <b> and your breasts are like clusters [of dates]</b>  [This refers to] Daniel,  Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, who were like breasts for you to suckle from. They were like clusters  [of dates], which shower liquid; so did they nurse lavishly and teach everyone that there is no fear like  fear of You. Until this point, the nations praise Him. From here on are the words of the Shechinah to  reveal Israel, who are among the nations.  <b> 9</b>  <b> I said: Let me climb up the palm tree</b>  I boast of you among the heavenly hosts, that I should be  exalted and hallowed through you in the lower realms, for you will hallow My name among the  nations. <b> let me seize its boughs</b>  and I will seize and cleave to you.  סנסנים  are boughs. <b> breasts be now</b>  And now, cause my words to be realized, that you will not be seduced after the  nations, and may the good and wise among you be steadfast in their faith, to retort to those who  seduce them, so that the small ones among you will learn from them.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And your palate is like the best wine</b>  Be careful with your answers that they should be like the  best wine. <b> that glides down smoothly to my beloved</b>  I am careful to answer them that I will remain  steadfast in my faith, that my palate will go before my beloved with straightforward love, which  emanates from the heart, and not from deceit and guile. <b> like the best wine</b>  which makes the lips of the  sleeping speak. Even my ancestors in the grave will rejoice with me and give thanks for their portion.  דובב  means moving, promued in Old French, stimulates (to talk), and its basis is an expression of  speech, and so is the reply: I am my beloveds, and he also longs for me.  <b> 12</b>  <b> Come, my beloved, let us go out to the field</b>  Our Rabbis expounded in Eruvin (21b): The  congregation of Israel said, O Lord of the Universe, do not judge me like the inhabitants of large  cities, where there is robbery and immorality, but like the inhabitants of villages, who are craftsmen,  and engage in the Torah amidst hardship. <b> let us lodge in the villages</b>  Heb.  בכפרים . Let us lodge  among the disbelievers  (בכופרים) . Come and I will show You the sons of Esau, upon whom You  bestowed plenty, but who do not believe in You.  <b> 13</b>  <b> Let us arise early to the vineyards</b>  These are the synagogues and the study halls. <b> whether the vine has blossomed</b>  These are the students of the Torah. <b> developed</b>  When the blossom falls off and the grapes are discernible, that is the development of the  סמדר , and he compares the students of the Mishnah to them, because they provide pleasure by  teaching Torah. <b> the pomegranates have lost their flowers</b>  when they become ripe, and the flower  around them falls off.  הנצו  means its flower  (נצו) , and he compares the Talmud students to them,  who possess full wisdom and are fit to teach. <b> there I will give you my love</b>  There I will show You my  glory and the glory of my sons and daughters.  <b> 14</b>  <b> the pots</b>  The pots of the good and the bad figs, as it is stated (Jer. 24:1f.): The Lord showed me,  and behold, two pots of figs, etc. One pot [contained] very good figs, etc., and the other pot  [contained] very bad figs, which could not be eaten. These are the transgressors of Israel. Now, both  of them have given forth their fragrance. They all seek Your countenance. <b> all manner of sweet fruits</b>  We have in our hands the reward for [fulfilling] many commandments. <b> both new and old</b>  that which the Sages innovated, as well as the old, which You wrote for me. <b> I have hidden away for you</b>  For Your name and for Your service I have hidden them away in my  heart. Another explanation: I stored them away to show You that I have fulfilled them.   <b> Chapter 8</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> O that you were like my brother</b>  that you would come to console me as Joseph did his brothers,  who did evil to him, and it is stated concerning him (Gen. 50:21): and he consoled them. <b> find you outside, I would kiss you</b>  I would find Your prophets speaking in Your name, and I would  embrace them and kiss them. I also know that they would not despise me, for Your love is worthy that  Your beloved should go around after You.  <b> 2</b>  <b> to the house of my mother</b>  the Temple. <b> who instructed me</b>  as You were accustomed to do in the  Tent of Meeting. <b> I would give you to drink some spiced wine</b>  libations. <b> of the juice</b>  sweet wine.  <b> 4</b>  <b> I adjure you</b>  Now the congregation of Israel addresses the nations, Even though I complain and  lament, my Beloved holds on to my hand, and He is my support in my exile; therefore, I adjure  you. <b> why should you awaken, and why should you arouse</b>  for it will not avail you.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Who is this</b>  The Holy One, blessed be He, and His tribunal say about the congregation of  Israel, Who is this? How esteemed is this one, who was exalted from the desert with all the good  gifts! There she was exalted at the giving of the Torah and with the cleaving of the Shechinah, and her  love is visible to all, and she is still in her exile. <b> embracing her beloved</b>  Heb.  מתרפקת , attached to her  beloved, admitting that she is his companion and clinging to him.  רפק  in Arabic is  רפקתא , union. <b> the apple tree I aroused you</b>  So she says in the request of the affection of her beloved: Under the  apple tree I aroused You. I remember that under Mount Sinai, formed over my head as a sort of apple  tree, I aroused You. That is an expression of the affection of the wife of ones youth, who arouses her  beloved at night when he is asleep on his bed, and embraces him and kisses him. <b> was in travail with you</b>  We have said that the Holy One, blessed be He, called her His mother (above  3:11). There she became Your mother. <b> was in travail</b>  Heb.  חבלתך , an expression of (Hos. 13:  13): birth pangs  (חבלי יולדה) , birth pangs came to her from you, like (Jer. 10:20): my children have  left me  (יצאני) , they went out of me.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Place me like a seal</b>  for the sake of that love, You shall seal me on Your heart, so that You should  not forget me, and You will see. <b> for love is as strong as death</b>  The love that I loved You is to me  equal to my death, for I was killed for Your sake. <b> zeal is as strong as the grave</b>  [This refers to] the  quarrel that the nations were jealous and quarreled with me because of You. [The word]  קנאה  everywhere [in Scripture] means enprenement in Old French, zealous anger, an expression of  determination to wreak vengeance. <b> fire of a great flame</b>  coals of a strong fire that comes from the  force of the flame of Gehinnom. The cantillation symbol of the zakef gadol, which punctuates  רשפי  (coals of) teaches us about the word  אש  (fire) that it is connected to  שלהבתיה , meaning fire of a great  flame, [or a flame of God, see Ibn Ezra].  <b> 7</b>  <b> Many waters cannot quench the love</b>  Since he refers to them with an expression of coals, the  language of cannot quench is appropriate for them. <b> Many waters</b>  the heathen nations. <b> rivers</b>  their  princes and their kings. <b> nor can...flood it</b>  (not] through strength and fear nor [even] through  enticement and seduction. <b> should a man give all his property for love</b>  in exchange for Your love. <b> they would despise him</b>  On all these the Holy One, blessed be He, and His tribunal testify that to this  extent the congregation of Israel embraces her Beloved.  <b> 8</b>  <b> We have a...sister</b>  in the lower realms, who is united, attaches herself [to us], and is desirous to be  with us; she is small and humbles herself more than all the [other] nations, as it is stated (Deut. 7:  7): Not because you are more numerous, etc., for they consider themselves insignificant. <b> a...sister </b> Heb.  אחות , an expression of joining  (אחוי) , (Moed Katan 26a): These are the tears that may not be  reattached  (מתאחי) . <b> who has no breasts</b>  as it is stated concerning the exile of Egypt: (Ezek. 16:  7): breasts fashioned, when the time of the redemption arrived, but this one has yet no breasts. Her  time has not yet reached the time of love. <b> for</b>  when the heathens whisper about her to destroy her, as it is stated (Ps. 83:5): Come, let us destroy  them from [being] a nation.  <b> 9</b>  <b> If she be a wall</b>  If she is strong in her faith and in her fear [of God], to be against them like a copper  wall, that they should not enter her midst, meaning that she will not intermarry with them, and they  will not come into her, and she will not be seduced by them. <b> we will build upon her a silver turret </b> We will be to her as a fortified city and for a crown and for beauty, and we will build for her the Holy  City and the chosen Temple. <b> and if she be a door</b>  which turns on its hinges, and when one knocks on  it, it opens. She, too, if she opens for them so that they enter her and she [enters] them. <b> enclose her with cedar boards</b>  We will put into her door wooden boards which rot and which the  worm gnaws and eats. Thereupon, the congregation of Israel will say:  <b> 10</b>  <b> I am a wall</b>  a strong [wall] in the love of my Beloved. <b> and my breasts are like towers</b>  These are  the synagogues and the study halls, which nurture Israel with words of Torah. <b> then</b>  when I said this. <b> was in his eyes as one who finds peace</b>  like a bride who is found perfect, and finds peace in her  husbands house.  <b> 11</b>  <b> Solomon had a vineyard</b>  This is the congregation of Israel, as it is said (Isa. 5:7): For the  vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel. <b> In Baal-Hamon</b>  in Jerusalem, which is populous  and has a multitude of people. <b> Baal</b>  an expression denoting a plain, like (Jos. 12:7): from Baal-Gad in  the valley of Lebanon. <b> he gave the vineyard to the keepers</b>  He delivered it into the hands of harsh  masters: Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom. In Midrash Shir Hashirim, I found some support to [the  theory that] these keepers are the kingdoms. <b> each one brought for the fruit thereof</b>  whatever they  could collect from them: head taxes, tithes, and illegal foreclosures; they collected everything from  them to bring into their homes.  <b> 12</b>  <b> My vineyard, which is mine, is before me</b>  for on the day of judgment, the Holy One, blessed be  He, will bring them to justice, and He will say, My vineyard, even though I delivered it into your  hands, it is Mine, and before Me is all that you seized for yourselves, its fruit. And that which you  collected from them is not hidden from Me. And they will say: <b> thousand</b>  The thousand pieces of silver that we collected from them, we will return everything to  You. <b> and those who watch its fruit, two hundred</b>  And we will add much more of our own, and we  will give it to them, to their heads and their sages, as it is stated (Isa. 60:17): Instead of copper I will  bring gold. <b> who watch its fruit</b>  These are the Torah scholars, and those payments are for the Torah  scholars, as it is stated (Isa. 23:18): but those who sit before the Lord shall have her commerce and  her hire, i.e., that of Tyre. And it can also be explained: and two hundred for those who watch its  fruitaccording to the law of a person who derives benefit from consecrated objects, who pays the  principal and a fifth. We too will pay, for (Jer. 2:3): Israel is holy to the Lord, the first of His  grain, the principal and a fifth, a fifth of the principal, and two hundred is a fifth of a thousand.  <b> 13</b>  <b> You, who sit in the gardens</b>  The Holy One, blessed be He, says to the congregation of  Israel, You, who are scattered in exile, grazing in the gardens of strangers and sitting in synagogues  and study halls... <b> the friends hearken to your voice</b>  The ministering angels, your friends, children of  God like you, hearken and come to listen to your voice in the synagogues. <b> let me hear [it]</b>  And  afterwards, they will declare [Gods] sanctity, as it is said (Job 38:7): When the morning stars sing  together. These are the Israelites. And afterwards, and all the angels of God will shout.  <b> 14</b>  <b> Flee, my beloved</b>  from this exile and redeem us from among them. <b> and liken yourself to a gazelle </b> to hasten the redemption and to cause Your Shechinah to rest. <b> on the spice mountains</b>  This is Mount  Moriah and the Temple, may it be built speedily and in our days, Amen.
