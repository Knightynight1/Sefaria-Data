\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ twice, yea, thrice, with a man.” But He does not forgive more (according to Shem Ephraim). And here, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ it is as follows: I have already behaved toward them according to My standard, to forgive them for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ three transgressions, and if there are more, surely the smaller number is included in the larger amount.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ hands; now I will visit upon them the retribution for threshing the inhabitants of Gilead, their

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ called ‘lime,’ which is made with numerous grooves, and with which they chastise people with 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ tortures, and with them they cut the stubble of the grain to make straw.
