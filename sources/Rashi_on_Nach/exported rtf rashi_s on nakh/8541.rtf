\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the corners of the earth like a man who grasps the corners of a garment and shakes it? So am I destined 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to grasp it [the earth] by its corners and shake the wicked [out of it]. Likewise, Scripture states (Isa. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 31:3): “and the Lord shall turn His hand, and the helper shall stumble,” like a person who, holding 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ something in his hand, drops it by inclining his hand.
