\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ thoughts upon which a person ponders and thinks during the day, and it is usual for the voice of a fool 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to come with many words, because by increasing his words, he utters a voice of foolishness from his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ mouth, for [from talking too much] transgression is inevitable; therefore, I say that your words should 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ be few.
