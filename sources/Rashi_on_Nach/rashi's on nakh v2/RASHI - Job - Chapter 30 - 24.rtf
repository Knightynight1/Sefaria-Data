\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ partial consolations. And so did our Sages (Pesikta d’Rav Kahana p. 1 27a) explain it: The Holy One, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ blessed be He, does not smite a nation and leave it desolate, but He brings misfortune to one and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ dandles it with its fellow that suffered already, and it is consoled thereby. He brought misfortune upon 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Assyria and dandled it with Egypt, as it is said (Nahum 3:8): “Are you better than the great No- 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Amon?” He brought misfortune upon Egypt and dandled them with Assyria, as it is said (Ezek. 31: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 3): “Behold Assyria was [a cedar] in the Lebanon.” The words \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ìäï ùåò\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  may also be interpreted as:
