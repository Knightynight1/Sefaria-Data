If He 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ did not show favoritism to His [own] Sanctuary, surely [He will] not [show favoritism] to the wicked 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of the heathens. The Midrash Aggadah explains: Do not read: \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÓƒÓÃƒ˜¿„Ã»˘—∆ÈÍ»\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , ìfrom Your Sanctuaries,î but

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ righteous, He is feared, elevated, and praised. Similarly, it is said (Lev. 10:3): ìThrough those near to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ me I will be sanctified.î [Also] (Exod. 29:43), ìand it will be sanctified with My honorî [i.e., with My 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ honored ones]. With the death of Aaronís two sons (Zev. 115b). Our Rabbis, however, expounded on 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the entire psalm until (verse 20): ìBlessed is the Lord; every dayî as referring to the giving of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Torah; (verse 10) ìgenerous rainî refers to the giving of the Torah, and (verse 11) ìYour congregation 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ dwelt therein,î means that they became engrossed in Torah (Mid. Ps. 68 with variations). But as for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ me I feel uncertain in explaining the expression \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ È˘·ÂÃ\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  as meaning that they became engrossed in Torah. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Also, my heart is uneasy at explaining (verse 17) ìthe mountain that God desired for His dwellingî as 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ referring to Mt. Sinai, because He did not desire it for His dwelling and [did] not [want] to dwell there 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ forever, whereas here it is written: ìEven the Lord will dwell there forever.î Likewise (verse 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 13): ìKings \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ÓÏÎÈ)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  of hosts,î he explained as ìangels \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ÓÏ‡ÎÈ)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  of hosts,î which is not the language of
