Rab.\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  83:2): Rabbi Aibu said: This was before a king 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ reigned in Israel, but since a king reigned in Israel, a governor reigned in Edom. Rabbi Jose the son of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Hanina says: When this one [Edom] appoints kings, this one [Israel] appoints judges; when this one 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ appoints chiefs, this one appoints princes. Said Rabbi Joshua the son of Levi: This one [Edom] 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ appointed eight [kings] and this one: [Israel] appointed eight [kings], and I heard [people ask]: Did 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Edom have only these eight kings, and did Israel have only eight? Were there not more? Joram, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Ahaziah, Joash, etc. Rather, the statement that this one appointed eight kings means that when they 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [Edom] appointed those eight kings of Edom, they [Israel] did not appoint the kings of Israel, because 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ they were before David.
