\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the mission to oppress and to besiege her and their land [(var.) your land], is neither weary nor slothful 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to come upon them as many as three times: one in the days of Pekah, when he took Ijon, Abel-beth- 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ maacah,... and Kedesh,...and Galilee, the entire land of Naphtali (II Kings 15:29). And that exile took 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ place in the fourth year of Ahaz, and in the twelfth year, ìthe Lord incited Pul, the king of Assyria... 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and exiled the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.î This verse is in Chronicles (I 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 5:26). This exile took place in the twelfth year of Ahaz, at the beginning of Hosheaís revolt, as is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ stated (II Kings 17:4): ìAnd the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea,î after he had 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ subordinated himself to him for eight years. Although the calculation is not explicit in the Bible, it is, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ nevertheless, possible to deduce it from the Baraitha of Seder Olam (Ch. 22). The third exile took 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ place in the sixth year of Hezekiah, the ninth year of Hosheaís revolt, when Samaria that is the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ capitalwas captured, and everyone was exiled. That is what is stated here, for there is no weariness for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the adversary, who will oppress her, [i.e.,] the land of Israel mentioned in the passage, ìAnd he shall 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ look to the land.î \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ like the first time, he dealt mildly, [exiling only] the land of Zebulun\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  This middle 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ exile will be like the one of the first time, when he dealt mildly to exile the land of Zebulun and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Naphtali, for also in the second one, he exiled but the two and a half tribes who were on the other side 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of the Jordan, but the last one was the third removal. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ he dealt harshly\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Heb. \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ‰Î·È„\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ .

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ everything away, like one who sweeps \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Ó¿Î«·Ã≈„)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  a house. This can also be interpreted as an expression of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ harshness according to the context of the verse, which commences first with an expression of ìdealt 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ mildly, [exiling only] the land of Zebulun,î he said, ìHe dealt harshly.î When Isaiah said this 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ prophecy, the first ones had already been exiled. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ the way of the sea\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  [Those dwelling by the Sea of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Tiberias] (Kinnereth): that is the land of Naphtali, concerning whom it was said (Deut. 33:23): ìThe 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sea and the southland you shall inherit.î \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ the other side of the Jordan\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  That is the second exile, that of

That is the entire land of Israel, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which would roll \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (‚ÃÂ…Ï∆Ï∆˙)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  to it all the nations, for all longed for it and came to it for commerce, like the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ matter that is stated (Jer. 3:19): ìA heritage desired by hosts of nations.î Jonathan, however, rendered 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ this differently.
