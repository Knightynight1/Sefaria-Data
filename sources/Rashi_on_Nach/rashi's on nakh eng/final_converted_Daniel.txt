<b> Daniel</b> <b> Chapter 1</b> <b> 1</b> <b> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim</b> Now is it possible to say so? Did he [Nebuchadnezzar] not reign in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as is stated (Jer. 25:1) in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah that is the first year of Nebuchadnezzar? So what is the meaning of In the third year? In the third year of his rebellion, as is stated (II Kings 24:1): and Jehoiakim was his vassal for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him; and in the third year, he overcame him, and that was the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar, for the master said (Seder Olam ch. 24): In his first year he conquered Nineveh, and in his second year he advanced and vanquished Jehoiakim, who served him for three years and rebelled against him for three years. That was the eleventh year of the reign of Jehoiakim: five years before he vanquished him, three years that he served him, and three years that he rebelled against him. And then Jehoiakim died under his hand, and in his stead, Nebuchadnezzar enthroned Jehoiachin, his son.    <b> 2</b> <b> and some of the vessels of the House of God</b> he took, and some of them remained, as is stated (in Jeremiah 27:19): so has the Lord of Hosts said concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels, which Nebuchadnezzar did not take into exile (sic). <b> and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god</b> to praise his idols; he brought the entire captivity there, even the people, and the vessels he brought afterwards to the treasury.    <b> 3</b> <b> the nobles</b> Heb. הפרתמים, dukes.    <b> 4</b> <b> and who have strength</b> Our Sages explained (Sanh. 93b) that they should restrain themselves from laughing, speaking and sleeping, out of fear of the throne, and resist the urge when they feel the need to relieve themselves. <b> and to teach them the script</b> This refers back to who have strength.    <b> 5</b> <b> allotted</b> Heb. וימן, an expression of preparation. <b> of... food</b> Heb. מפתבג. That is the name of the kings fare in the language of the Chaldeans. Some interpret פתבג, [as] bread, but it does not appear correct, for it is written (below verse 16): The steward would take away פתבגם... and give them pulse. Now pulse is not a substitute for bread, but a substitute for cooked food.    <b> 7</b> <b> Belteshazzar</b> He named him after the god of Babylon, which was called Bel, as it is said (4: 5): whose name is Belteshazzar, like the name of my god. Teshazzar is the Aramaic expression denoting wisdom.    <b> 8</b> <b> not to be defiled</b> Heb. לא יתגאל, an expression of sullying.    <b> 9</b> <b> the chief officer</b> who was the chief over the kings servants.    <b> 10</b> <b> who allotted</b> who prepared and provided. <b> like you</b> כגילכם, of your likeness. It is the language of the Mishnah; one of his likeness. <b> and you will forfeit my head to the king</b> You shall bring about that I will be condemned to be beheaded.    <b> 11</b> <b> the steward</b> Heb. המלצר, the one who arranges the portions and the plates, called maestre sala, seneschal, steward.    <b> 12</b> <b> test</b> Heb. נסan expression of (נסיון)testing. <b> some pulse</b> a type of beans instead of the food.    <b> 13</b> <b> and as you will see</b> According to what you see, do.    <b> 16</b> <b> carry away their food</b> He would take it for himself.    <b> 18</b> <b> that the king ordered to bring them</b> that they come before him.    <b> 20</b> <b> the necromancers</b> These are the ones who inquire of טימי מתים, the bones of the dead, as you say, May his bones be crushed, שחיק טמיא. <b> the astrologers</b> These are the ones who press the constellation. So it is explained in Tanhuma (Miketz 2, Buber, Miketz 4).    <b> 21</b> <b> And Daniel was there</b> in greatness in Babylon until the first year of King Cyrus. According to the one who says that Hathach (Esther; 4:5, 6, 9, 10) is Daniel; and why was he called Hathach? Because he was cut off (חתכוהו)from his greatness; [according to his explanation] we must say that this is Cyrus I, who preceded Ahasuerus. But according to the one who says that all royal affairs were decided (נחתכים)by his orders, we must say that this Cyrus was Darius II, [who came] after Ahasuerus, and in the days of Darius the Mede, when they cast [Daniel] into the lions den, he was not demoted from his greatness, as it is said (6:29): And this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and during the reign of Cyrus the Persian. We learn that during the days of Cyrus I he was [still] in his greatness.    <b> Chapter 2</b> <b> 1</b> <b> Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzars reign</b> It is impossible to say this, except that [it happened] in the second year after the destruction of the Temple. So it is taught in Seder Olam (ch. 28), and Scripture called it of Nebuchadnezzars reign, because he demonstrated his insolence by entering the Inner Sanctum of the Sovereign of the Universe. <b> and his spirit was troubled</b> Heb. ותתפעם רוחו. Concerning Pharaoh it says (Gen. 41:8): ותפעם רוחו, for only the interpretation of the dream was hidden from him, but here, since the dream too was hidden from him, the expression is doubled: ותתפעם, an expression of pulsating and beating. <b> was interrupted</b> Heb. נהיתה, an expression of breaking like (Ezek. 7:25): Breach upon breach (הוה על הוה).    <b> 4</b> <b> May the king live forever</b> Aram. מלכא לעלמין חיי. <b> Tell your servants the dream</b> [as translated,] Tell your servants the dream.    <b> 5</b> <b> The matter has escaped me</b> The thing has left me. <b> meaning</b> [as translated,] if you do not let me know the dream and its meaning. <b> from limb</b> Aram. הדמין תתעבדון. You shall be cut to pieces, and there are many such in the Gemara (Gittin 67b): Arrange the cuts (הדומי הדמוה). <b> a dungheap</b> Aram. נולי, a dungheap. <b> made</b> Aram. יתשמוןan expression of וישם, and he will make. They shall be made into dungheaps.    <b> 6</b> <b> But if</b> [as translated,] But if. <b> and lavish presents</b> [as translated,] presents. <b> but</b> [as translated,] but. <b> tell me</b> [as translated,] tell me.    <b> 7</b> <b> a second time</b> [as translated,] a second time. <b> we shall tell</b> [as translated,] we shall tell.    <b> 8</b> <b> in truth, I know</b> [as translated,] in truth, I know. <b> truth</b> Aram. יציב, a true and permanent thing. <b> that this time you are doomed</b> Aram. די עדנא אנתון זבנין, that this time you are delivered to death. <b> because you see</b> because you see that the matter escaped me, but you repeatedly ask me to tell you.    <b> 9</b> <b> or if you have prepared yourselves...a false and corrupt word</b> Or if you have prepared yourselves to say before me a false and corrupt word. <b> until the time changes</b> until the time changes, i.e., before the shadows of evening slant, when the time of morning changes. Until the time changes is an expression of rebuke and an exaggeration: so will he be punished, and the punishment was already delineated above. A similar instance is (Gen. 4:15): Therefore, whoever kills Cain. <b> but</b> the dream; tell me what I dreamed, and I shall know that you will surely tell me the interpretation.    <b> 10</b> <b> who...the kings word</b> who will be able to tell the kings word. <b> because</b> Aram. כל קבל, lit. all opposite; i.e., our reply is true, in view of the fact that there was never a king who asked anything like this. <b> such a thing</b> Aram. מלה כדנה, a thing like this. <b> astrologer</b> who presses the constellation.    <b> 11</b> <b> difficult</b> Aram. יקירה, heavy, and its burden is heavy. <b> and there is no other who can tell it</b> and there is no other who will tell it. <b> but the angels</b> but the angels whose dwelling is not with flesh and blood. <b> whose dwelling</b> Aram. מדרהון, their dwelling. The Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (ad loc.) [says]: ואחרן לא איתי, and Aaron is not here. A priest who wears the Urim and Tummim is not here to tell you. He said to them, That Temple was so powerful, and you advised me to destroy it? Immediately, he became angry and commanded to slay them.    <b> 12</b> <b> In view of this</b> in view of this reply. <b> in great wrath and anger</b> Aram. מלכא בנס וקצף שגיא. The king was in great wrath and anger. (בנס)means in wrath. (Gen. 40:6): And behold they were angry (זעפים), and Onkelos renders: נסיסין. <b> and ordered to destroy</b> Aram. ואמר להובדה. About this vav of ואמר, Menahem and Dunash disputed. Menahem (p. 46) forced himself to make the beth of בנס, a radical and did not interpret בנס וקצףas nouns, but as an expression of a verb: was greatly wroth and angry and ordered to destroy. The vav in ואמרforced him to interpret it this way. Dunash (p. 9) says that it is impossible for the beth to be a radical, but it is a noun, and he interpreted it in this manner: with great wrath and anger he ordered to destroy, and the vav there is superfluous, like the vav of (Ps. 76:7): chariot (ורכב)and horse. But I say that the vav is not forced to be superfluous, but so is its interpretation: מלכא בנס וקצף שגיא, the king was in great wrath and anger, and he ordered in his wrath to destroy them. Accordingly, this is an elliptical verse.    <b> 13</b> <b> And a decree was issued</b> The law of the king and his decree were issued in the province. <b> Daniel and his colleagues were sought to be slain</b> [as translated,] and Daniel and his colleagues were sought to be slain.    <b> 14</b> <b> Then</b> Aram. באדין, the Targum for אז. <b> answered with counsel and good sense</b> He answered [with] counsel and good sense to Arioch, the name of the man. <b> the...chief executioner</b> the officer over those who executed the ones condemned to death.    <b> 15</b> <b> Why was the decree issued so hastily</b> Why is the decree of the king [issued] in such a haste to kill? <b> Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel</b> that the king was angry because no one told him his dream.    <b> 16</b> <b> entered and requested</b> [as translated,] entered and requested. <b> be given him</b> [as translated,] be given him.    <b> 19</b> <b> the secret was revealed</b> [as translated,] the secret was revealed.    <b> 21</b> <b> changes</b> [as translated,] changes. <b> removes</b> He removes kings, for he understood from the dream that Nebuchadnezzars kingdom would terminate, and another kingdom would rise.    <b> 22</b> <b> He reveals the profound</b> [as translated,] He reveals the profound. <b> and secret things</b> for He revealed this profound thing to me.    <b> 23</b> <b> You have let me know</b> [as translated,] You have let me know.    <b> 24</b> <b> In view of this</b> in view of this, that the secret was revealed to him. <b> Daniel came in to Arioch</b> He entered Ariochs premises. <b> had appointed</b> [as translated,] had appointed. <b> Do not destroy</b> [as translated,] Do not destroy. <b> bring me in</b> [as translated,] bring me in.    <b> 25</b> <b> Then</b> Aram. אדין, [the equivalent of] אז. <b> in haste</b> Aram. בהתבהלה, in haste, i.e., quickly. <b> in</b> brought Daniel in. <b> that I have found a man</b> [as translated,] that I have found a man. <b> Judea</b> [as translated,] the exiles of Judea.    <b> 26</b> <b> Do you have the ability</b> Are you able?

There remained to Nebuchadnezzars reign thirty-seven years, for he reigned forty-five years, and twenty-three of Evil-merodachs, as our Sages stated in Tractate Megillah (11b), and the two years of Belshazzar that passed, totaling sixty-two.    <b> 3</b> <b> And over them</b> [as translated,] and over them. <b> that these satraps should give them counsel</b> that these satraps should give counsel to the three viziers. <b> and the king should not suffer any injury</b> And the king should not suffer any loss in any royal matter that is incumbent upon them to perform.    <b> 4</b> <b> this Daniel</b> [as translated,] this Daniel. <b> surpassed</b> [as translated,] surpassed. <b> contemplated</b> The king was thinking in his heart to set him up over all of them.    <b> 5</b> <b> sought to find a pretext</b> They were seeking a pretext to find about Daniel in matters of the kingdom so that they could inform on him.    <b> 6</b> <b> No pretext can be found</b> They said among themselves, No pretext can be found about this Daniel. <b> but we shall find [a pretext] against him</b> but we shall find a pretext against him through the law of his God if we ask the king to issue some decree to cause him to transgress His law, and he will not fulfill the kings command; and this is the pretext.    <b> 7</b> <b> assembled</b> Aram. הרגישו, they approached the king.    <b> 8</b> <b> have taken counsel</b> [as translated,] have taken counsel. <b> to preserve the kings law</b> to preserve the kings law with power because you have recently ascended the throne.

We can still interpret it as I saw written in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon, that they are the 1,335 years stated at the end of the Book (12:12): Fortunate is he who waits [and reaches the days one thousand three hundred and thirty-five], and he explains the appointed time as until the time of two times and a half time, and he [Rav Saadia Gaon] said that the times are 480 [years], which is the time from the Exodus from Egypt until the Temple was built, and 410 [years], [which are] the days of the First Temple, totaling 890, and another half of this time, 445, totaling 1, 335. Figure these from the time the daily sacrifice was discontinued until the daily sacrifice will be restored to its place; it was discontinued six years prior to the destruction, and there is somewhat of a proof in this Book. [See Rashi to 8:14.] Others bring further proof to this computation, namely that (Deut. 31:18): And I, will hide My face [the words] הסתר אסתירadd up in gematria to 1,335.    <b> 26</b> <b> And the judgment was established</b> And the judgment was established before Him. <b> remove his dominion</b> from heaven.

That is an expression of bitter (מר) anger.    <b> 8</b> <b> an appearance of four</b> an appearance of four horns.    <b> 9</b> <b> And from one of them</b> and from one of these kingdoms. <b> emerged a...horn</b> The kingdom of Titus emerged from it. <b> small</b> A small and despised kingdom, as he calls it above one small horn, and that is in the manner of (Obad. 1:2): ...you are very despised. <b> and it became very great</b> Heb. ותגדל מאד. <b> to the south</b> That is Egypt, which is to the south of the land of Israel. <b> and to the coveted land</b> Heb. הצביThe land of Israel, called ארץ הצבי, the coveted land [or the land of beauty] after the manner of (Jer. 3:19): an inheritance of the beauty of hosts of nations.    <b> 10</b> <b> until the host of heaven</b> They are Israel, who were compared to the stars.    <b> 11</b> <b> And until the Prince of the host</b> That is the Temple, which is the House of the Holy One, blessed be He, the Prince of the host. He blasphemed the Holy One, blessed be He. <b> daily sacrifice was removed</b> And through his troops and his armies, which he sent to Jerusalem, the daily sacrifice was abolished, for he sent there Nero Caesar, his general, as our Rabbis relate in Gittin (56a) and in Gorion.    <b> 12</b> <b> And a time will be given for the daily sacrifice</b> A set time will be given for the daily sacrifice to be discontinued because of transgression. <b> And a time</b> Heb. וצבא, time, like (Job 7:1): Is not man on earth for a limited time (צבא)? <b> and it will cast truth to the earth</b> It humbled the Torah of truth.    <b> 13</b> <b> one holy one</b> one of the angels. <b> and...said</b> that angel. <b> to the anonymous</b> Heb. לפלמוני. This word is like two: פלוני אלמוני, and Jonathan ben Uziel translated it in the Book of Samuel (I 21: 3): covered and hidden, like (Deut. 17:8): If a matter be hidden (יפלא)from you. אלמוניmeans a widower (אלמן)without a name, [i.e., bereft of a name] for he [the angel] did not explain to him what he was and what his name was. <b> to the anonymous one who was speaking</b> to the angel who was speaking and issuing decrees, viz. And a set time will be given for the daily sacrifice because of transgression. <b> How long will be the vision</b> this [vision] which concerns the daily sacrifice, that it should be discontinued, and the silent abomination will be placed in its stead. The silent abomination is an idol worshipped by the pagans, which was like a mute stone, and so it is called in this Book in many places, as it says (12:11): And from the time the daily sacrifice was removed and the silent abomination placed. <b> mute</b> Heb. שמם, an expression of being mute and silenced, like (4:16): was bewildered (אשתומם)for awhile; (Ezek. 3:15): and I sat there seven days bewildered (משמים)among them, like one who is dumb. <b> permitting the Sanctuary and the host to be trampled</b> to make the base of the Sanctuary and the host of heaven, which he cast down to the earth, to be a trampling for his feet, as is stated above (verse 10): and it cast down to the ground some of the host and some of the stars. <b> the Sanctuary and the host</b> Heb. וקדש וצבא. The vav [of וקדש] is superfluous, and there are many such instances in Scripture, e.g. (Ps. 76:7): chariot (ורכב)and horse were stunned, and also, in the language of people, some speak that way.    <b> 14</b> <b> Until evening and morning, one thousand and three hundred</b> I saw an interpretation in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon for this matter, but it has already passed, and he interpreted further until evening and morning, that evening about which it says (Zech. 14:7): and it shall come to pass that at eventide it shall be light, and we are confident that our Gods word will stand forever; it will not be nullified. I say, however, that the ערבand בקרstated here are a gematria, and there is support for this matter from two reasons: 1) that this computation should coincide with the other computation at the end of the Book, and 2) that Gabriel said to Daniel later on in this chapter (verse 26): And the vision of the evening and the morning is true. Now, if he had not hinted that the computation was doubtful, why did he repeat it to say that it was true? And the seer was commanded to close up and to seal the matter, and to him, too, the matter was revealed in a closed and sealed expression, but we will hope for the promise of our king for end after end, and when the end passes, it will be known that the expounder has erred in his interpretation, and the one who comes after him will search and expound in another manner. This can be interpreted [as follows]: namely, that ערב בקרhas the numerical value of 574, ע= 70; ר= 200; ב= 2; ב= 2; ק= 100; ר= 200. Added together, this equals 574; plus 2,300, we have 2,874. <b> and the holy ones shall be exonerated</b> The iniquity of Israel shall be expiated to bring an end to the decrees of their being trodden upon and crumbled since they were exiled in their first exile to Egypt, until they will be redeemed and saved with a perpetual salvation by our king Messiah, and this computation terminates at the end of 1,290 years from the day the daily sacrifice was removed, and that is what is stated at the end of the Book (12:11): And from the time the daily sacrifice is removed, and the silent abomination placed, will be 1,290 years, and no more, for our king Messiah will come and remove the silent abomination. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction of the Second Temple, and an image was set up in the Heichal. Now that was the seventeenth day of Tammuz, when Apostomos burned the Torah, put an end to the daily sacrifice, and set up an image in the Heichal, as we learned in Tractate Taanith (26b), but for the six years that I mentioned, I have no explicit proof, but there is proof that the daily sacrifice was abolished less than a complete shemittah cycle before the destruction, for so did Daniel prophesy about Titus (9:27): ...and half the week of years [shemittah cycle] he will curtail sacrifice and meal-offering, meaning that a part of the week of years before the destruction, sacrifices will be abolished. So it is explained below in this section. Let us return to the earlier matters, how the computation of evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred, fits exactly with the time commencing from the descent to Egypt to terminate at the end of 1,290 years until the day that the daily sacrifice was abolished: 210 years they were in Egypt. 480 years transpired from the Exodus until the building of the Temple. 410 years the Temple existed. 70 years was the Babylonian exile. 420 years the Second Temple stood. 1,290 should be added until the end of days, totaling: 2,880. Subtract six years that the daily sacrifice was removed before the destruction, for Scripture counted 1,290 years only from the time that the daily sacrifice was removed. Here you have the computation of evening and morning, and 2,300 added to the computation. Fortunate is he who waits and reaches the end of days 45 years over 1,290 [years]. We may say that the king Messiah will come according to the first computation, and he will subsequently be concealed from them for forty-five years. Rabbi Elazar HaKalir established (in the concluding poem of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): in the foundation of his song: six weeks of years, totaling 42. We may say that the three years that did not total a week of years he did not count. And I found it so in Midrash Ruth that the king Messiah is destined to be concealed for forty-five years after he reveals himself, and proof is brought from these verses.    <b> 15</b> <b> that I sought understanding</b> I was longing that they should enable me to understand [the vision] from heaven.    <b> 16</b> <b> in the midst of the Ulai</b> in the midst of the river. <b> and he called</b> i.e., the man. <b> and said</b> to the angel, You, Gabriel. <b> enable this one to understand the vision</b> explain the vision to this one. <b> one</b> Heb. להלז, an expression of esteem, as he called him חמודות, one of desirable qualities. Wherever it says הלזit refers to a person of form, and from here they learned in the Aggadah: Isaac resembled his father in form and in likeness, for he is called האיש הלזin the section commencing, Now it came to pass when Isaac was old. (Gen. 39:6): ...and Joseph was fair in form and fair in appearance. This is the beauty enumerated among the five things that a father merits for his son.    <b> 17</b> <b> to the time of the end.</b> For many days this vision will come about.    <b> 18</b> <b> I fell into a sound sleep</b> An expression of slumber and bewilderment. <b> had been standing</b> Where my feet were standing.    <b> 19</b> <b> for it is the end of the time</b> for it is at the time of the end of many days.    <b> 20</b> <b> The kings of Media and Persia</b> The two horns represent two ruling nations, as I explained above.    <b> 21</b> <b> the first king</b> He is Alexander of Macedon who slew Darius, the son of Esther, as we find in the book of Josiphon (ch. 9).    <b> 22</b> <b> And the broken one</b> that you saw being broken. <b> in whose stead stood four</b> as is written in the narration of the dream above (verse 8), [there] are four kingdoms which will arise from that nation, for Alexander of Macedon divided his kingdom upon his death [into parts for] four youths, and Joseph called them four heads of a leopard in his book, and they were not the sons of the king. <b> its strength</b> The last ones will not be as strong as the first king, but they will be weaker than him.    <b> 23</b> <b> And at the end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have been destroyed</b> When the end arrives, and the wicked of Israel in the Second Temple will be finished, a brazen-faced person will rise; he is Titus.    <b> 24</b> <b> And his power will become strong</b> and not with might but with smooth talk, as is explained at the end of the Book (11:21). <b> and he will destroy wondrously</b> and with wonder upon wonder, he will destroy. <b> and he will prosper and accomplish</b> his desire. <b> and he will destroy the mighty</b> many nations. <b> and the people of the holy ones</b> Israel, who believe in the Torah.    <b> 25</b> <b> And through his intellect, he will cause the deceit in his hand to prosper</b> And because he is clever wherever he turns and [because] he will prosper, he will hold onto deceit with his hand. <b> his heart he will become proud</b> Heb. יגדיל, lit, he will grow larger. <b> destroy many</b> With guile and with smooth talk he will destroy many who dwell with him with a covenant and in peace. <b> and over the Prince of princes he will stand</b> He will speak blasphemously about Heaven. This is the meaning of the dream written above (verse 11): [And until the Prince of the host it grew.] <b> and without strength he will be broken</b> And without strength he will be broken, through a mosquito, the weakest of creatures, which entered his nose, as we learned in Tractate Gittin (56b).    <b> 26</b> <b> And the vision of the evening and the morning</b> which was said to you in the preceding dream, is true. <b> and you close up the vision</b> Do not explain it, but close it up in your heart, for it will come about in many days.    <b> 27</b> <b> became broken</b> Heb. נהייתי, an expression of calamity (הוה)and breach; i.e., I was pained because of this trouble and I was depressed. <b> the kings work</b> for I was appointed over the assignment of the work of the government of Belshazzars kingdom, for Nebuchadnezzar his father had appointed him, as is written in the beginning of the Book (2:48): ...and gave him dominion over all the capital cities of Babylon. <b> and I was terrified about the vision</b> Heb. ואשתומם על המראה. <b> but no one realized </b> that I was terrified because I restrained myself before the princes.    <b> Chapter 9</b> <b> 1</b> <b> In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus</b> This is not the Ahasuerus of the days of Haman, for he was the king of Persia, whereas this one was Darius the Mede who was crowned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans when Belshazzar was slain, as is written above (6:1): And Darius the Mede took (sic) the kingdom.    <b> 2</b> <b> Contemplated the calculations</b> Heb. בינתי בספרים. <b> the number of the years, etc.</b> I contemplated the calculation of the years, for I thought about what Zeremiah (29:10) prophesied: For at the completion of seventy years of Babylon I will remember you, and I thought that this remembrance is the building of the Temple, and that the seventy years end in the first year of Darius the Mede, since the kingdom of Babylon stretched forth a hand upon Israel, when Nebuchadnezzar vanquished Jehoiakim to be his slave. Now that was in the second year of Nebuchadnezzars reign, as the master said (Meg. 11b): In the first year he conquered Nineveh; in the second year he went up and vanquished Jehoiakim. Figure from that year until now, and you will find them [the 70 years]. This calculation is found also in the Mishnah of Seder Olam (ch. 28), and we learned there that in the year of Belshazzars death were 70 years from the day that Nebuchadnezzar ascended the throne: seventy minus one since the day that he conquered Jehoiakim, and yet one more year for Babylon, which Darius completed. And when I [Daniel] saw that the redemption was not hastening to come, I contemplated and put my heart to the calculation, and I knew that I should not have counted according to the conquest of Jehoiakim but [according] to the destruction of Jerusalem, when 70 years will be complete from the exile of Zedekiah, when Jerusalem was destroyed. And there are yet 18 years to come, for this exile was in the eighteenth year counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, as we learned in Seder Olam: They were exiled in the seventh year; they were exiled in the eighth year; they were exiled in the eighteenth year; they were exiled in the nineteenth year. Our Sages in Tractate Megillah (11b) explained that they were exiled in the exile of Jeconiah in the seventh year, counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, which is the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzars reign. They were exiled a second time in the eighteenth year, counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, which is the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzars reign.    <b> 4</b> <b> and I confessed</b> the sins of my people. <b> O great and awesome God</b> but he did not say, mighty. He said [to himself], Heathens are enslaving His children, so where are His mighty deeds?    <b> 5</b> <b> turning away</b> We were constantly turning away from Your commandments, tolant in Old French, turning away.    <b> 7</b> <b> To you, O Lord, is the righteousness</b> i.e., Your judgments and retributions that You have brought upon usjustice and righteousness are with You. <b> and to us is the shamefacedness</b> We should be ashamed for what has happened to us, for we caused it for ourselves. <b> as of this day</b> as we see today.    <b> 9</b> <b> To the Lord our God are the mercies</b> that we did not perish for our iniquities, for we rebelled against Him.    <b> 11</b> <b> have befallen us</b> Heb. ותתך, and You caused to reach us, like (Exod. 9:33): לא נתך ארצה, and Onkelos rendered: did not reach the earth. <b> the curse and the oath</b> the curses of the Covenant with which You adjured us at Horeb (Lev 26:14): And if you do not listen etc.; all the curses written there.    <b> 12</b> <b> as was done in Jerusalem</b> the sword, slaying, the burning of the city; and they humbled women and put captives into neck irons.    <b> 13</b> <b> As is written in the Law of Moses</b> a hint that He warned us that if we transgress the oath, all this evil will befall us.    <b> 14</b> <b> hastened</b> Heb. וישקד, and hastened. <b> for...is righteous</b> for justice is with Him. Our Rabbis, however, explained that the Holy One, blessed be He, is charitable, and it is charity for us that He hastened and brought [the evil] two years before the numerical value of ונושנתם(Deut. 4:25): and you will have grown old, in order that [the curse of] that you shall perish should not be fulfilled with you. The numerical value of ונושנתםis 852, but they were exiled at the end of 850 [years] after their entry into the land.    <b> 15</b> <b> And now, O Lord, our God</b> We confess that we have sinned and have dealt wickedly.    <b> 16</b> <b> a mockery</b> [as translated,] a mockery. <b> to all those surrounding us</b> to all our neighbors; they all mock us.    <b> 17</b> <b> for the sake of the Lord</b> For the sake of the holy Name that is called upon the Temple, as it says (Exod. 15:17): the Sanctuary, O Lord, (אדני)which Your hands have established.    <b> 18</b> <b> and see our desolations</b> and the desolations of the city upon which Your name is called, because not upon the support of our righteousness do we cast our supplications to benefit us, but we have come upon Your mercies.    <b> 19</b> <b> O Lord, hear</b> our supplications. <b> O Lord, forgive</b> our sins. <b> O Lord, hearken</b> Your ear to our cry. <b> and do</b> our request and do not delay.    <b> 20</b> <b> about the mount of the Sanctuary of my God</b> for the mount of the House of God, that it be built.    <b> 21</b> <b> at first</b> in the days of Belshazzar, as is written above (8:15 26). <b> in swift flight</b> [He was] caused to fly to me with flying and with gliding.    <b> 22</b> <b> And he enabled me to understand</b> Heb. ויבן.    <b> 23</b> <b> In the beginning of your supplications, a word came forth</b> a true [word came] from the Holy One, blessed be He, to me to tell you. <b> for you have desirable qualities</b> You have qualities that are desirable to the Holy One, blessed be He. <b> now contemplate the word</b> Put your heart to understand the word.    <b> 24</b> <b> Seventy weeks [of years] have been decreed</b> on Jerusalem from the day of the first destruction in the days of Zedekiah until it will be [destroyed] the second time. <b> to end sin</b> so that Israel should receive their complete retribution in the exile of Titus and his subjugation, in order that their transgressions should terminate, their sins should end, and their iniquities should be expiated, in order to bring upon them eternal righteousness and to anoint upon them (sic) the Holy of Holies: the Ark, the altars, and the holy vessels, which they will bring to them through the king Messiah. The number of seven weeks is four hundred and ninety years. The Babylonian exile was seventy [years] and the Second Temple stood four hundred and twenty [years].    <b> 25</b> <b> And you shall know and understand from the emergence of the word</b> From the emergence of this word, which emerged at the beginning of your supplications to tell you, you shall know to understand [how] to restore and build Jerusalem. <b> until the anointed king</b> Time will be given from the day of the destruction until the coming of Cyrus, king of Persia, about whom the Holy One, blessed be He, said that he would return and build His city, and He called him His anointed and His king, as it says (Isa. 45:1): So said the Lord to His anointed one, to Cyrus etc. (verse 13): He shall build My city and free My exiles, etc. <b> seven weeks</b> Seven complete shemittah cycles they will be in exile before Cyrus comes, and there were yet three more years, but since they did not constitute a complete shemittah cycle, they were not counted. In the one year of Darius, in which Daniel was standing when this vision was said to him, seventy years from the conquest of Jehoiakim terminated. Deduct eighteen years from them, in which the conquest of Jehoiakim preceded the destruction of Jerusalem, leaving fifty-two years. This is what our Rabbis learned (Yoma 54a): For fifty-two years no one passed through Judea. They are the fifty-two years from the day of the destruction until they returned in the days of Cyrus. Hence, we have seven shemittah cycles and three years. <b> return and be built</b> i.e., the city with its streets. <b> and moat</b> Heb. וחרוץ. They are the moats that they make around the wall to strengthen the city, which are called fosse in French, ditch or moat. <b> troubled times</b> But in those times they will be troubled and distressed, for in the subjugation of the kings of Persia and the heathens, they will burden them with harsh bondage. Now although there are sixty-two weeks and four years more that remain from the eighth week, whose beginning, viz. the three years, was included in the fifty-two years of the duration of the exile, those four years were not counted here because here he counted only weeks, and you find that from the beginning he started to count seventy weeks, and at the end, when he delineated their times and their judgments, he counted only sixty-nine, proving that one week was divided, part of it here and part of it there; and he mentioned only whole weeks. <b> but in troubled times</b> They will be troubled in those times.    <b> 26</b> <b> And after</b> those weeks. <b> the anointed one will be cut off</b> Agrippa, the king of Judea, who was ruling at the time of the destruction, will be slain. <b> and he will be no more</b> Heb. ואין לו, and he will not have. The meaning is that he will not be. <b> the anointed one</b> Heb. משיח. This is purely an expression of a prince and a dignitary. <b> and the city and the Sanctuary</b> lit. and the city and the Holy. <b> and the people of the coming monarch will destroy</b> [The monarch who will come] upon them.

Alexander of Macedon will rise, for although Israel was subjugated by the kings of Persia in those days, they exacted a light tribute from them, and they did not burden them heavily because the Holy One, blessed be He, caused them to have mercy on them.
