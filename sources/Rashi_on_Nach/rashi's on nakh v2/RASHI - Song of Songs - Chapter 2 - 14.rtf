\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and they could not turn because of the wild beasts. What did they resemble at that time? A dove that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ fled from a hawk and entered the clefts of the rocks, and a snake was hissing at her. Should she enter 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ within, there was the snake. Should she go outside, there was the hawk. The Holy One, blessed be
