This is not yours, for this is a decree that emanated 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from Me many years ago, that you will exact My recompense from the nations, as the matter is written 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (supra 10:5): “Woe! Assyria is the rod of My wrath.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ Have you not heard from long ago\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  More than 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ seventy years (correct version as in Parshandatha and Warsaw edition) since Amos prophesied two 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ years before the earthquake (Amos 7:17), “and Israel shall be exiled from upon its land.” Since then, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ you should have heard that I wrought and prepared this retribution. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ in days of yore\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Since the six days 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of Creation, that decree that was decreed upon you entered My mind, as it is said (supra 30:33): “For 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Tophteh is set up from yesterday, that too has been prepared for the king.” Now that I have given you 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ superiority over the nations, I have brought it, that decree, in order that it shall be to make desolate, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ blossoming hills [of] fortified cities, that you shall slay their inhabitants and they shall remain devoid 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of people and they shall be prepared for hills where vegetation grows.
