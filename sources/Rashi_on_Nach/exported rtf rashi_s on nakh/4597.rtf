\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ young bulls, one ram.” We can explain this verse only as meaning seven bulls and seven rams for the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ seven days, a bull daily and a ram daily, and it comes to teach us that the bulls do not render each 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ other invalid and the rams do not render each other invalid. [I.e., if one bull is missing, the other one 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ may be brought.] So we learned in Menahoth (45a); however, they did not bring proof from this verse 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ but from the verse below (46:6): “But on the New Moon: a young bull from those without blemish, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and six lambs and a ram.” But perhaps this too comes to teach the same thing, and this is its meaning: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ seven bulls and seven rams daily. By adding the sacrifices of each day on its day, they add up to seven 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ bulls for the seven days. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and a sin-offering, a he-goat daily\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  the he-goats of the pilgrimage festivals.
