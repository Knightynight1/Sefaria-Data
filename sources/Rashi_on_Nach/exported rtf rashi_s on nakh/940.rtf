\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Eglah, a heifer) and similarly the Scripture states: “If you had not plowed with my heifer” (Jud. 14:18). 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Now, is it not stated: “And Michal the daughter of Saul did not have a child to the day of her 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ death” (infra 6:22)? Until the day of her death she did not have children after that incident (when she 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ showed contempt for David). Prior to that incident, however, she did have a child.
