\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of Jeroboam, on the roads, to guard lest the Israelites perform the pilgrimage for the festivals, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ this one abolished them, for the golden calves had already been exiled in the two exiles. In the first 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ exile “he took Ijon and Dan.” He exiled the calf that was in Dan. And in the second, when Reuben 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and Gad were exiled, he took the calf that was in Bethel, to fulfill what was stated (Hosea 10: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 6), “That too, to Assyria will be transported.” Since the sentries were abolished, and they (the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Israelites) refrained from performing the pilgrimage, therefore, their verdict was sealed to be exiled 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ in his days, for until now, they had blamed the corruption on their kings, but now they had no one to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ blame. This is what Hosea the son of Beeri said (Hosea 5:3), “For now you have gone astray, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Ephraim; Israel has become defiled.” Now your evil has been revealed.
