\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ when Samuel turned to go away from following Saul, Saul seized the skirt of Samuel’s robe, since Saul 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ was entreating him to return until he would prostrate himself in Gilgal, where the tent of meeting had 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ been. In Midrash Aggadah, however, Amoraim differ on this point. Some say that Saul tore Samuel’s 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ robe, and some say that Samuel tore Saul’s robe, thereby giving over to him this sign, that whoever 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ would sever the skirt of his robe would reign in his place. And that is what Saul said to David on the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ day that he severed the robe, “I know that you will reign” (infra 24:21).
