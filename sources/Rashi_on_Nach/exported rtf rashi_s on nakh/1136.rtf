\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ more drawn to him since I represent ten parts. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ why then did you slight me?\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  By preceding me[in the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ king’s escort]. Had I not spoken first concerning the return of my king? for [indeed] our words to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ reinstate him came first; as it is written: “And the word of all of Israel came to the king.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ words of the men of Judah were harsher\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  A similar expression is: “Correct yourselves etc” (Zeph. 2: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 1). The words of the people of Judah seemed [more] plausible and correct for they showed them a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ letter that David had sent them [stating]: “Why should you be last to reinstate the king, etc.” (above v. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 12). In this manner it is explained in the Aggadah. Now one may also explain \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ åé÷ù\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  as an expression of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ harshness and strength. And so did Jonathan translate: ‘were harsher.’
