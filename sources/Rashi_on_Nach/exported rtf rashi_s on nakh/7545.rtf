\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ here and cities for our children.” They made the main thing of secondary import, for they placed their

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the rest of the tribes, as is explained in Seder Olam (ch. 22), and in the Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (see Mattoth 7): “In the second year of Ahaz, the Lord aroused the desire of the king of Assyria, etc. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (I Chron. 5:26),” but the rest of the tribes were exiled in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which is the ninth 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ year of Hoshea the son of Elah.
