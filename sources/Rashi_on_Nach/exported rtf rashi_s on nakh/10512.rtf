\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Bathsheba, and when the Adversary enticed him to count Israel. This is the most accurate 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ interpretation, but others explain “first” as meaning superior to Solomon and Rehoboam. Regarding 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Solomon, it is written (I Kings 11:4): “his wives turned away his heart” at the end of his days, and he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, and for Molech, the abomination of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ children of Ammon." Regarding Rehoboam, it is written (above 12:1): “And when he became strong, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he abandoned the Law of the Lord.” [Jehoshaphat was also not] like Abijam, about whom it is written 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (I Kings 15:2): “and his heart was not complete with the Lord, his God,” or like Asa, who did not rely 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ on the Lord; [Jehoshaphat] resembled his father, David, who had only one heart for his Father in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ heaven. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and did not inquire of the baalim\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  like the practice of Israel in his time, for Ahab, who was in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ his time, worshipped the baalim, as did Israel in his time.
