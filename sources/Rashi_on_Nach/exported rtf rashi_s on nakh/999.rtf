\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 7:1). Now this is also Jonathan’s interpretation; “whom messengers of God went...” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ to redeem to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ Himself a people\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  This the messengers said to the Israelites. “The Holy One blessed is He sent us to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ redeem to Himself a people, and to make to Him a name, and to accomplish for you the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ greatness.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and fearful things\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  You did for Your land after they came out of there (Egypt). Now what 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ were these fearful things that You did from before Your people? To drive out nations and their gods. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ This verse appears to be missing the word \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ìâøù\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  (to drive out), since in I Chron. 17:21 it specifies: “to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ drive out from before Your people nations and their gods.” However it is not missing; for when the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ text states: “from before Your people...nations,” we may infer from it banishment and driving out.
