\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that you are the son of your father. Everybody knows that your father was completely righteous, and if

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ entered in order to have a son well-formed and of strong vitality, because marital relations are 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ beneficial during the last six months. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and what, the son of my vows?\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  All your father’s wives would 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ vow that they would have a son fit for the throne, but I vowed that I would have a son bright in Torah.
