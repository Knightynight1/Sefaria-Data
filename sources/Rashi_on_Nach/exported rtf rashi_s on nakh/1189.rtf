\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ David had bows hanging in his palace and foreign kings would come and see them and say to each 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ other: Do you suppose that he can actually bend them? They are merely intended to frighten us. And 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ David would overhear and would take them [the brass bows] and crush them before their eyes (sic). 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Now \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ðçú\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  is an expression of bending. And so we find “Your arrows were flung [by bending the bow] 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ into me” (Ps. 38:3).
