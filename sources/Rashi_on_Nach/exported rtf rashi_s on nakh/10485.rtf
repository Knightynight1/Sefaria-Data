\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ was first made king, he was forty-one years old; therefore, he had the strength and the power to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ strengthen himself. He was a year old when David died, for Solomon reigned forty years, and Solomon 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ had not yet reigned when Rehoboam was born. We find that Rehoboam was forty-one years old when 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he reigned. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ the city that the Lord had chosen wherein to place His name, out of all the tribes of

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ not set his heart to seek the Lord,” and they caused the Shechinah to leave them, and it was as if they 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ were complaining and demonstrating about that.
