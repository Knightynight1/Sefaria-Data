\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ fruit, it is more beloved than them all, for its fruit is good in both taste and fragrance. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ so is my beloved

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ above all the gods. Therefore, in His shade I delighted and sat. The Midrash Aggadah (Song Rabbah), 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [states]: This apple tree—all flee from it because it has no shade. So did all the nations flee from the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Holy One, blessed be He, at the giving of the Torah, but I in His shade I delighted and sat.
