\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the Omnipresent. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ for their work\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  namely, of the rains; for the work which is incumbent upon them to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ do, either good or evil, he is turned about with many circuits, as [the passage] that we learned (Rosh 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Hashanah 17b): if Israel were perfectly righteous on Rosh Hashanah so that [much] rain was decreed 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for them, and they should later become sinful—it would be impossible to decrease it [the amount of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ rain] because the decree would already have gone forth; but the Holy One, blessed be He, would let it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ come down out of its season and upon a land that did not require it. “And sometimes to do good”; how 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is this? etc. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ whatever He commands them\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Those rains, to do on earth. [Another explanation: And he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ turns around in circuits with His guidance—He causes the clouds and the winds to encompass the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ mountains so that they should be watered from all sides. In the Aggadah of “ Vehayah ekev” (Sifrei 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Ekev 39).]
