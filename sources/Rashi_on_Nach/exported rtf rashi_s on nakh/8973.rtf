\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Creation, is fit to exist forever, and it cannot be changed, either by adding or by diminishing, and when 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ it is changed, God commanded and caused it to be changed, in order that they should fear Him. The 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ocean broke through its boundary in the generation of Enosh and inundated a third of the world, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ God did this so that they would fear Him. For seven days, the course of the sun was changed in the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Generation of the Flood, to rise in the west and set in the east, in order that they fear Him. The sun 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ went back ten steps in the days of Hezekiah, and in the days of Ahaz his father, the day was shortened 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and the night was lengthened on the day of his death, so that he should not be eulogized. All this was 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ so that they would fear Him. Therefore, there is nothing better for a man to occupy himself with than 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ with His commandments and to fear Him.
