\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sufferings of poverty.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ for...this\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  These sufferings are to be chosen above poverty. A man to whom 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ people behaved with respect and who has been accustomed to wealth all his life, will now stand and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ bargain, and having no money [to pay with], will be embarrassed and return home in disappointment. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Now if you say that Job was a poor man in addition to his sufferings, we do not find that he lost 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ anything except his livestock, but not silver or gold. And even if he lost his cattle with silver and gold, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ it is better for him to be a poor sick man than to be healthy and go in the marketplaces empty-handed 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [and be embarrassed as well]. In this manner, it is explained in the midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Mishpatim 11) from this verse, that Job’s sufferings are preferable to the sufferings of poverty, and so 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ in the Aggadoth of the Talmud (Baba Bathra 116a).
