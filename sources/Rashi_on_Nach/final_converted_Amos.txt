<b> Amos</b>  <b> Chapter 1</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> who was among the herdsmen</b>  Heb.  בנקדים . Jonathan  renders: who was an owner of livestock. Cf.  (II Kings 3:4) Now Mesha the king of Moab was an owner of livestock  (נקד) . <b> earthquake</b>  -Two years before Uzziah was plagued, the day Isaiah prophesied, as it is stated: (Isaiah 6:  4) And the doorposts quaked, and it is stated: (Zechariah 14:5) As you fled before the earthquake.  <b> 2</b>  <b> shall roar from Zion</b>  -From the Holy of Holies the speech emanates. <b> shepherds shall be cut off</b>  - Jonathan  renders: And the dwellings of the kings shall become desolate,  and the strength of their walled cities shall be destroyed.  <b> 3</b>  <b> For three transgressions of etc.</b>  -As it is stated (Job 33:29) Lo, all these things does God work,  twice, yea, thrice, with a man. But He does not forgive more (according to Shem Ephraim). And here,  it is as follows: I have already behaved toward them according to My standard, to forgive them for  three transgressions, and if there are more, surely the smaller number is included in the larger amount. <b> yea for four I will not return them</b>  -For the fourth transgression, I need no longer return him empty-  handed from taking his recompense from Me, and surely since there are many transgressions in their  hands; now I will visit upon them the retribution for threshing the inhabitants of Gilead, their  neighbors. <b> with sledges of iron</b>  - Jonathan  renders: morigin  of iron. Now that is a sort of file  called lime, which is made with numerous grooves, and with which they chastise people with  tortures, and with them they cut the stubble of the grain to make straw.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Hazael etc. Ben Hadad</b>  -The kings of Aram, and the head of Aram is Damascus.  <b> 5</b>  <b> from Bikath-Aven</b>  -That is a place in Aram. <b> and one who holds the scepter</b>  -[Jonathan  renders:]  and one who exercises sovereignty. Cf. (Gen. 49:10) The scepter shall not turn away from  Judah, since the ruler castigates the people with sticks. <b> from Beth-Eden</b>  -A place name. <b> to Kir</b>  -A  place name, where Sennacherib exiled them during the time of Ahaz, as it is stated: And he went up  to Damascus and seized it, and exiled Aram to Kir. [see II Kings 16:9, where the wording differs.] All  the retribution that the prophets of Israel prophesied concerning the nations - the prophets who  preceded Sennacherib, e.g. Isaiah and Amos, prophesied concerning the sword of Sennacherib, and  Jeremiah and Ezekiel prophesied concerning the sword of Nebuchadnezzar.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Gaza</b>  -That was a city of the Philistines. <b> a whole captivity</b>  -I.e, the captivity of Israel, that the  captivity be complete, that no one should escape, for they would stand on the roads and seize those  fleeing and deliver them. And so did the people of Tyre, and so to the four sides during the destruction  of the Second Temple, as is delineated in the Aggadah of Haazinu (Sifre  322), Gaza from the south,  Tyre from the north, Damascus from the east, the Arabs from the west, as it is stated: (Isaiah 21:  13) The harsh prophecy concerning Arabia: In the forest in Arabia did you lodge, on the roads of  your cousins.  <b> 8</b>   Ashdod... Ashkelon... Ekron  -They were the lords of the Philistines. <b> My hand</b>  -I will smite them repeatedly.  <b> 9</b>  <b> and did not remember the brotherly covenant</b>  -which existed between Hiram and Solomon, as it  is said: (I Kings 5:26) And they both made a league together. And they called each other brothers, as  it is said: (ibid. 9:13) And he said: What are these cities that you have given me, my brother?  <b> 11</b>  <b> for pursuing their brother with a sword</b>  -As it is said: (Num. 20:18) Lest I go forth against you  with the sword. And he still clings to his anger, keeps his wrath, and has not retracted it. <b> forever their anger</b>  -He clung to it and did not let it go.  <b> 12</b>  <b> the palaces of Bozrah</b>  -It is between Moab and Edom, and it belonged to the land of Moab, but it  was attracted to Edom. And it set up a king for them when the first king died, and it is said: (Gen. 36:  33) Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah. [from Gen. Rabbah 83:3]   <b> 13</b>  <b> they ripped up the pregnant woman of Gilead</b>  -They destroyed it and also ripped up their  pregnant women so that no heir would remain who would contest the inheritance. And so does  Scripture state: (Jer. 49:1) Concerning the children of Ammon. So said the Lord: Has Israel no sons?  Has he no heir? Why has Malcam taken possession of Gad?   <b> Chapter 2</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> For he burnt the bones etc.</b>  -Once the king of Edom fell into the hands of the king of Moab, and  they burned his bones and plastered them on the walls of the house, and the Holy One, blessed be He,  requited the injustice inflicted upon the king, for they treated him with disgrace.  <b> 2</b>  <b> Kerioth</b>  -A place name, as it is stated: (Jer. 48:24) And to Kerioth and to Bozrah. <b> tumult</b>  -The sound of the stirring of battle.  <b> 6</b>  <b> for selling an innocent man for money</b>  -The judges would sell the one who was innocent according  to the law, with money; i.e, with the bribes they would receive from his opponent. <b> order to lock [the fields]</b>  Heb.  נעלים . Jonathan  renders in two places [here and below 8:6]: in order  to inherit. And I say that this is its explanation. They pervert the judgment of the poor man so that he  will be compelled to sell his field that he had between the fields of the judges, and this one seeks an  opportunity and takes it for a cheap price in order to fence in and lock all his fields together, and it  should not intervene between them.  <b> 7</b>  <b> Who aspire on the dust of the earth</b>  -On the dust of the earth, when they walk on it, all their  aspiration and all their thoughts are concerning the head of the poor, how they will rob them and take  their property.  ש איפה  is goloser  in O.F., aspiring. <b> and they pervert the way of the humble etc.</b>  -The  weak turn away from their way and go on a tortuous way because of fear of them, as Scripture says:  (Job 24:4) They turn the poor from the way. <b> to the maid</b>  -I.e, a betrothed maid.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And they recline on pledged garments</b>  - Jonathan  renders: On couches of a pledge they dine. They  settle [the charge as] a loan upon the poor. and they take a pledge from them, and make their garments  into couches and recline on them at the time of their meal. <b> they recline</b>  -An expression of dining, for  all their meals were eaten while leaning, for he would lean on his left side. <b> ones</b>  -from whom they would exact money for fines and drink wine with it. <b> in the house of their god</b>  -  In the house of the idol that they had beside the altar.  <b> 9</b>  <b> as oaks</b>  Heb.  אלונים , kesnes (chenes) in French. <b> his fruit from above</b>  -I.e, the celestial princes.  [from Midrash Tanchuma , Devarim 4; Tanchuma  Buber, Addendum to Devarim 8] <b> below</b>  -I.e, the earthly princes. Another explanation: the wasp would blind their eyes from above and  castrate them from below. [from Sotah  36a]  <b> 11</b>  <b> as Nazirites</b>  - Jonathan  renders: as teachers. For they were separated from the ways of the people of  the land and were engaged in the Torah. The expression  נזירה  is everywhere only an expression of  separation. <b> Is this not so?</b>  -This is a rhetorical question. I.e, can you deny this?  <b> 12</b>  <b> And you gave the Nazirites to drink wine</b>  -lest they instruct you, for a drunken man is forbidden  to instruct. <b> And you gave the Nazirites to drink wine</b>  - Jonathan  renders: And you misled your  teachers with wine. <b> Do not prophesy.</b>  -Amaziah the priest of Bethel commanded Amos in this  manner: (Amos 7:12) Seer, go, flee to the land of Judah.  <b> 13</b>  <b> Behold I will oppress</b>  Heb.  מעיק , the Aramaic translation of  מציק , <b> your dwelling place</b>  Heb.  תחתיכם . Your camping place <b> as a wagon... is oppressed</b>  from the weight of the burden that is  upon it.  <b> 15</b>  <b> and the fleet-footed shall not deliver</b>  -himself.  <b> 16</b>  <b> shall flee naked</b>  -Naked without weapons.   <b> Chapter 3</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> Only you did I love</b>  Heb.  ידעתי , lit., I knew. I loved you, but you rebelled against Me; therefore,...  But our Sages expounded on it in a different manner in Tractate Avodah Zarah  (4a).  <b> 3</b>  <b> Will two walk together</b>  -Concerning what you say to the prophets, Do not prophesy, do the  prophets prophesy from their own mind unless they were commanded? Are things done in any way but  in their customary fashion? <b> unless they agree</b>  -Unless they made an appointment to go together to  such and such a place.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Will a lion roar in the forest if he has no prey</b>  -When a lion lays hold of its prey, it customarily  roars, and it does not roar unless it has taken [prey]. Similarly, Scripture states: (Isa. 5:29) He will  roar like the lion cubs, and he will growl and lay hold of prey. Similarly, (ibid. 31:4) As a lion or a  young lion growls over his prey.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Will a bird fall on a net upon the ground unless it has a snare</b>  -in the net which has fallen upon  it? <b> Will a net ascend from the ground</b>  -from the place it was laid unless a bird was caught in it?  When it wishes to escape, it pulls up the net and lifts it from its place a little, and at that time it is  caught.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Will a shophar be sounded</b>  -For the lookout sees troops approaching the city and sounds the  shophar to warn the people. These are but words of allegory and similitude, [to be explained as  follows:] <b> [4] Will a lion roar</b>  -That is Nebuchadnezzar. Another explanation: The prophets compare  the holy spirit that comes upon them from the roar of a lion, as he states below: (verse 8) A lion has  roared; who will not fear? And here he explains the allegory. Did the Holy One, blessed be He, bring  the holy spirit into the mouths of the prophets to [prophesy] evil unless retribution was decreed by  Him? That is the prey. Will the Holy One, blessed be He, let out a cry to speak harshly unless He has  taken you with the snare of iniquity? Will a bird fall on a net that the net will not snare it? I.e, is it  possible that you commit sins and it will not be a snare to you? Will a net ascend etc.? Similarly, will  your iniquities ascend on high and not take you? Will a shophar be sounded in the city?... So should  you quake before the words of the prophets who look out for you to deliver you from the evil, that it  not come, and when the evil comes to you, should you not know that the Holy One, blessed be He,  does it to you because you did not take heed of His prophets?  <b> 7</b>  <b> For the Lord God does nothing unless He has revealed His secret</b>  -That secret to His servants,  the prophets.  <b> 8</b>  <b> A lion has roared; who will not fear?</b>  -So has the Holy One, blessed be He, spoken to the prophets  to prophesy. Who will not prophesy?  <b> 9</b>  <b> Announce</b>  -You Philistines and Egyptians, announce this and say in your palaces that they gather on  the mountains of Samaria, to see from atop the mountains into the midst of the city, their evil way.  <b> 10</b>  <b> right</b>  Heb.  נכחה , meaning straight. <b> violence and plunder</b>  -I.e, money of plunder.  <b> 11</b>  <b> An adversary, even round about the land</b>  -The adversary is prepared to come, and he will come  around this land.  <b> 12</b>  <b> As the shepherd saves</b>  -I.e, he saves little. <b> the cartilage of an ear</b>  Heb.  בדל . [from Jonathan ] <b> will the children of Israel... be saved</b>  I.e, very few people. <b> of a couch</b>  Heb.  בפאת מטה ובדמשק ערש . Jonathan  renders: with the strength of rule and trusting in  Damascus. I say that the interpretation of the Targum  is as follows: Since, in the days of Jehoahaz son  of Jehu it is written. (II Kings 13:7) For the king of Aram had destroyed them, and Jeroboam his  grandson saved them partially, as it is said. (ibid. 14:27) And the Lord did not speak to eradicate the  name of Israel from under the heavens, and He saved them through Jeroboam the son of Joash. (ibid.  verse 25) He restored the boundary of Israel. And that is the meaning of in the corner of a  bed. The corner of a house is the strongest part of the house. Therefore, he translates. with the  strength of rule of Jeroboam, and Amos prophesied in the days of Jeroboam. He further prophesied  that they would eventually rely on the kings of Aram, and so they did in the days of Pekah son of  Remaliah. This is the meaning of  ובדמשק ערש , and their couch will be Damascus. Their rest and trust  will be on Damascus. And our Sages said in Seder Olam  (ch. 22) Rabbi Nehorai said in the name of  Rabbi Joshua: These are the ten tribes, which relied on Hezekiah, and on Judah, and escaped with  them. <b> in the corner of a bed</b>  -This teaches us that only one eighth of them was left. And the rest of  the couch -where was it? In Damascus, to fulfill what is stated: (below 5:27) And I will exile you  beyond Damascus. And I heard in the name of Rabbi Menahem of blessed memory, that he  explained. This is one eighth, since it is not stated. the corner of; but in the corner of a bed, in part  of it, in one of the two ends of a corner. That is an eighth of the bed, for it has four corners, and two  ends of each corner. [This is Rabbi Menahems explanation of Seder Olam  ch. 22. This is probably  Rabbi Menahem ben Helbo, the author of Pithronim .] Another explanation I found in the words of  Rabbi Meir of blessed memory, as follows: <b> In the corner of a bed</b>  -Because of the sin of Ahaziah son  of Ahab, who sent to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this  illness (I Kings 1:2). <b> and in Damascus is the couch</b>  -Ben-hadad, king of Aram, sent to inquire of the  God of Israel (ibid. ch. 8).  <b> 15</b>  <b> the winter house with the summer house</b>  -Since they were delicate, the wealthy people would  build for themselves two houses, one for the winter and one for the summer. <b> ivory houses</b>  -Which  are paneled with ivory. [from Jonathan ]   <b> Chapter 4</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> cows of Bashan</b>  -This refers to the wives of the princes and the officers. Jonathan  renders: wealthy in  property.  <b> 2</b>  <b> and you shall be borne on shields</b>  Heb.  בצנות . And the nations shall bear you on their shields. <b> your posterity in fishing boats</b>  Heb.  בסירות דוגה . [Jonathan  renders:] And your daughters in  fishermens boats. That is a small boat used by fishermen, and, since it is small, he calls it  סיר , a pot,  and in Mishnaic Hebrew, it is called  דוגית  in Baba Bathra  73a. <b> your posterity</b>  Heb.  ואחריתכן , lit., your  end. Dunash ben Livrat (Teshuvoth  p. 50): We find a persons descendants called his end. Cf. (Daniel  11:4) And when he stands up, his kingdom shall be broken, and it shall be divided to the four winds  of the heaven, and not to his posterity  (לאחריתו) . I.e, he will not leave over his kingdom to his son.  <b> 3</b>  <b> And [through the] breaches they shall emerge, each woman straight before her</b>  -And in the  breaches of the wall they shall emerge there to flee. <b> each woman straight before her</b>  -In the breach  that she will find straight before her. Cf. (Josh. 6:5) And the people shall go up, every man opposite  him  (נגדו) , for there will be many breaches, and they will not find it necessary to search for  entrances. <b> and you shall cast off the haughtiness</b>  Heb.  ההרמונה . And you shall cast off yourselves the  haughtiness and the authority that you took. This is an Aramaism in the Talmud: (Baba Mezia  84)   הר  מנה דמ לכא , It is the kings command. And Jonathan  renders: And they shall exile you beyond the  טורי חר מיני  . They are the mountains of darkness, an expression of destruction  (חרם)  and waste.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Come to Bethel etc.</b>  -Like a man who says to a scoundrel, Do [as you please] until your measure  [of sin] is full. <b> and bring your sacrifices in the morning</b>  -The priests of Baal say to them, "Idolatry  is liberal and does not impose stringent regulations upon you. The Torah states: (Exodus 34:25) Shall  not stay overnight, but for idolatry, And bring in the morning.  The Torah states concerning  sacrifices of lesser sanctity: (Lev. 19:6) On the day of your sacrifice, it may be eaten, and on the  morrow,  but idolatry, after three days your tithes of cattle. The Torah states: (Lev. 2: 11) Leaven...  you shall not offer up, but idolatry, (verse 5) And offer up a thanksgiving offering of leaven.  The  Torah states: (Deut. 23:22) You shall not delay its payment, but idolatry, and proclaim and publish  the free will offerings. Proclaim: Whoever vowed and forgot, shall give it thought and  remember. (Yerushalemi, Avodah Zarah  1:1) And Jonathan  renders: And offer up from robbery. Cf. (Isa.  1: 17) "Strengthen the robbed  (חמוץ) ; (Psalms 71:3) From the hand of the unrighteous and the  robbers  (ומ חמץ) .  <b> 5</b>  <b> and proclaim and publish the freewill offerings</b>  -with a song, and say that this sacrifice is  desirable and acceptable as a freewill offering. So did Jonathan  render.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Cleanness of teeth</b>  Heb.  נקיון ש נים . Setting your teeth on edge. [I.e, they would have nothing to  eat, and their teeth would be set on edge.] Another explanation: cleanness of teeth. This denotes the  lack of meat, which goes between the teeth, as it is stated: (Num. 11:33) The meat was still between  their teeth.  <b> 7</b>  <b> when there were yet three months before the harvest</b>  -Until the harvest. I.e, three months before  the harvest. <b> field</b>  Heb.  חלקה , a fielded plain, campagne in French. <b> shall receive rain</b>  Heb.  תמטר , shall  be a place of rain. The master stated: Both of them are for a curse; this one will rot, and this one will  wither. [from Taanith  6b] <b> and the field upon which no rain shall fall</b>  -That will not show itself rained  upon.  <b> 9</b>  <b> the increase of your gardens</b>  -That you are engaged in increasing your gardens. <b> locust has devoured</b>  Heb.  יאכל , lit., shall devour. Has devoured.  <b> 10</b>  <b> after the manner of Egypt</b>  -Just as I sent upon you in the desert when you left Egypt. <b> captivity of your horses</b>  -For they slay the horses as well. <b> rise</b>  -The smell of your corpses would raise a stench, and I caused it to rise into your nostrils.  <b> 11</b>  <b> like a brand</b>  Heb.  כאוד , tison in French, an ember; i.e, black and dark and burnt black.  <b> 12</b>  <b> Therefore</b>  -Since you did not return to Me. <b> because I will do this to you</b>  -as all these evils. <b> because</b>  -Since you hear from the mouth of My prophets that I will do this to you, prepare to meet Me,  to repent of your wickedness.  <b> 13</b>  <b> what his speech is</b>  -All his deeds are related in detail before him at the time of his death. <b> makes dawn</b>  -for the righteous like a bright light. <b> darkness</b>  -He turns the brightness of the wicked into  darkness. Cf. (Isa. 8:22) And behold, distress and darkness, darkness  (מעוף)  of  oppression. Similarly, (Job 10:22) Land of darkness  (עפתה)  ; (ibid. 11:17) Darkness  (תעפה)  shall  be like morning. Your darkness shall shine like the morning. <b> earth</b>  -He humbles the high and haughty.   <b> Chapter 5</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> The virgin of Israel</b>  -When they are exiled in the days of Hoshea son of Elah (II Kings 17:1-6), a  king will never again rise from the ten tribes. <b> she is spread out on her soil</b>  Heb.  נטשה . Anything that  is cast, lying, and spread out upon the field is called  נטישה .  <b> 3</b>  <b> that gives forth a thousand</b>  Heb.  היצאת , that gives forth a thousand men.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Seek Me and live</b>  -Perform the pilgrimage to pay your vows in Jerusalem.  <b> 5</b>  <b> But seek not Bethel etc. nor pass Beersheba</b>  -Here it does not say, You shall not come, or You  shall not seek, but, You shall not pass. This teaches us that there was no idol worship there, but as  long as one of the members of the ten tribes would go out to seek and did not yet pass Beersheba, he  could still turn to the Temple, to Jerusalem, and once he passed Beersheba, that is the way to the calf  in Bethel or to the calf in Dan. And so Scripture states: (infra 8:14) As your god, O Dan, lives, and as  the way of Beersheba lives. And you should know [that this is so], for Scripture pronounced decrees  of retribution on Gilgal and Bethel, and did not decree upon Beersheba. <b> for Gilgal shall be exiled</b>  -  According to its name is its curse. And, similarly, there is a city near Bethel named Beth-aven in the  Book of Joshua (7:2). <b> shall become nought</b>  Heb.  לאון . [Jonathan  renders:]  ללמא , which is the Aramaic  translation of  הבל , vanity, and this is a similarity to (Hosea 12: 12) If Gilead is nought, it is because  they are but futility.  <b> 6</b>  <b> lest He break out like fire</b>  Heb.  יצלח . Lest His anger ascend as fire to the house of Joseph. <b> house of Joseph</b>  -Like  לבית יוסף , to the house of Joseph.  <b> 7</b>  <b> Those who turn justice to wormwood</b>  -and they do not remember My conversions, that I turn etc.  <b> 8</b>  <b> and turns darkness into morning</b>  -There are some who live now in darkness, for whom I made it  light. <b> and day He darkens as night</b>  -There is one for whom the time is favorable as the light of day,  and I darken it as the night. <b> He Who calls the water of the sea</b>  - Jonathan  renders: He Who said to  gather camps as numerous as the water of the sea, and scatter them upon the face of the earth. And  our Sages explained it as a reference to the generation of Enosh, when He caused the water of the  ocean to inundate them. [from Mid. Psalms  88:2, Gen. Rabbah  23:7] <b> the Lord is His Name</b>  -They should  have worshipped Him, and He would have given them power over their enemies.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Who strengthens</b>  Heb.  המבליג , Who strengthens. Like (Job 10:20) And I will gain strength  (ואבליגה)  a little while; (Jer. 8:18) Were I to suppress  (מבליגיתי)  my grief. <b> the robbed</b>  Heb.  ושד . A person who was robbed and weak [Jonathan  renders:] Who strengthens the weak over the  strong, and the robbed He gives rule over strong walled cities.  <b> 10</b>  <b> They hated him who reproves them in the gate</b>  -You do not fear Him or His prophets, and you  hated those who reprove you in the gates of the courts.  <b> 11</b>  <b> you have trodden</b>  Heb.  בושסכם , like  בוססכם , you have trodden on the poor, that you trample and  tread on his head. Like (Jer. 12:10) They have trampled  (בוססו)  My field. <b> you take</b>  -The settling of the balance as a loan, that you raised the market price for them immediately  to sell them grain with interest, in order to take their estate from them. Therefore, houses and  vineyards that you have built and planted on those estates shall not remain in your hands. <b> burden</b>  Heb.  משאת , an expression of  משא , a burden, which they make heavy upon them. <b> vineyards</b>  Heb.  כרמי חמד .  <b> 12</b>  <b> you who oppress the just</b>  -[Jonathan  renders:] who oppress the innocent. <b> gate</b>  -In the gates of your courts, they turned aside the judgment of the needy.  <b> 13</b>  <b> the prudent</b>  -Whoever is wise shall keep silent when the evil comes, and he shall not criticize the  Divine standard of justice, for they did all these. <b> for it is a time of evil</b>  -[I.e.] a time destined [for  them] to receive their evil.  <b> 14</b>  <b> and so... shall be etc.</b>  -If you do this, the Omnipresent shall be with you as you said in your heart,  that you will keep your greatness.  <b> 15</b>  <b> the remnant of Joseph</b>  -All Israel are called by his name because he sustained them.  <b> 16</b>  <b> Alas! Alas!</b>  Heb.  הו הו , an expression of a cry. <b> and they shall meet the plowman with mourning </b> Heb.  וקראו . They shall meet companies of plowmen, plowing in the fields, with the voice of the  lamentation of the mourners crying in the streets. <b> and lamentation with those who know to wail</b>  -  [Jonathan  renders:] And the one who makes a lamentation shall meet one who makes a wailing. And  this is only a repetitious expression. Cf. (Ps. 9:5) My right and my cause  (משפטי ודיני) .  <b> 18</b>  <b> Woe to those who desire etc.</b>  -Those who say, Let Him hurry; let Him hasten His deed. (Isa. 5:  19) <b> Why would you have etc.</b>  -There is a parable concerning a rooster and a bat that were awaiting  the dawn, as appears in the chapter entitled  Chelek .  <b> 21</b>  <b> [the sacrifices of] your assemblies</b>  -[Jonathan  renders:] The sacrifice of your assemblies; i.e, when  you call an assembly.  <b> 22</b>  <b> and the peace offerings of your fattened cattle</b>  Heb.  שלם מריאיכם , the peace offerings of your  fatlings, i.e, fattened cattle.  <b> 23</b>  <b> Take away from Me the din of your songs</b>  -that the Levites sing on the platform, since you are  robbers and perverters of justice.  <b> 24</b>  <b> And justice shall be revealed like water</b>  Heb.  ויגל . And you shall do this, and I will accept you.  The justice that you have hidden and concealed shall be revealed and stream among you like water.  [after Jonathan ] <b> and righteousness</b>  -shall be revealed like a mighty stream. [after Jonathan ]  <b> 25</b>  <b> Did... sacrifices and meal offerings</b>  -Is My desire for sacrifices and meal offerings? Is it not so  that in the desert I did not speak with your forefathers to offer up sacrifices to Me? I said: (Lev. 1:  2) Should a man sacrifice, when he wishes to sacrifice. And Scripture states: (Num. 9:2) And the  children of Israel shall make the Passover sacrifice in its time. This tells us that Israel made only that  Passover sacrifice. [based on Sifre  to Num. 9:2]  <b> 26</b>  <b> And you shall carry Siccuth your king</b>  -He returns to the matter of the retribution [mentioned]  above. The day of the Lord is darkness for you, and not light, and you shall carry your idols into exile  with you. The enemies shall load them on your necks to carry them with you into exile.  Siccuth...  Chiun... Kochav  -They are names of pagan deities.  <b> 27</b>  <b> And I will exile you beyond Damascus</b>  -I.e, you shall not be exiled to your neighbors as  heretofore, that you were delivered into the hands of the kings of Aram [In Nach Lublin-Edom, an  obvious error] and they did not take you in captivity to a distant place, but to Damascus. From now  on, I will deliver you into the hands of Sennacherib, and he shall exile you far away.   <b> Chapter 6</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> those called the first of the nations</b>  -You were called the most praiseworthy of the nations. <b> house of Israel has come to them</b>  -They chose the ordinances of the nations and came to be included  among them.  <b> 2</b>  <b> Proceed to Calneh and see</b>  -Why have you rejected My Torah to cleave to the ordinances of the  nations?

[Note that this is also found in Lev. Rabbah  5:3.] Another  explanation. <b> You who despise the day of evil</b>  -You who despise the prophecy of the days of evil,  which the prophets prophesy to them. <b> and you bring near a dwelling of violence</b>  -This is as Isaiah  states: (5:8) " Woe to those who join a house to a house. You bring near dwelling in their midst one  beside the other through violence.  <b> 4</b>  <b> and stretch out on their beds</b>  Heb.  וסרחים . They spread themselves out and stretch themselves out  on their beds.

Some of our Sages state in Tractate Shabbath  (62b)  that they would throw their cups to each other, and some explain that this was the name of a vessel  that had two mouths, and it was long, and one would drink from here and one from here, it would be  cast from this ones mouth to this ones mouth. <b> and with the first oils</b>  -The best of the oils, which is  balsamum. <b> and they feel no pain</b>  Heb.  ולא נחלו , an expression of illness. <b> destruction of Joseph</b>  -For they heard from the prophet that it was destined to befall them.  <b> 7</b>  <b> and the banquet of the haughty shall pass away</b>  Heb.  וסר מרזח סרוחים . And the banquets of the  aggrandized and the haughty shall be abolished.  מרזח  is an expression of banquets. In Sifre , in the  section commencing: (Num. 25:1) And Israel sojourned in Shittim," I found: And they returned to  make  מרזחים  for them, and they would invite them, and they would eat.  <b> 8</b>  <b> by Himself</b>  -With knowledge and intention. <b> abhor</b>  Heb.  מתאב . Like  מתעב  And so did Jonathan  render  it: I abhor the Temple, the greatness of Jacob.

In this manner, Jonathan  rendered it: And his kinsman  shall carry him out of the fire. <b> and he shall say</b>  I.e, the one who takes [the bodies] out of the fire. <b> to </b> [the one] <b> who is in the end of the house</b>  -I.e, to his friend who went to search within the house. <b> there any more with you?"</b>  -Is there any living person besides you who escaped among the hidden  ones? <b> and he shall say, "There is none.</b>  -There is no living one, only dead. And this one says to him,  "Take out the corpses.  הס , Cast out and eliminate everything. For this comes to them because they  did not want to mention the Name of the Lord. In this manner, Jonathan  rendered it.  <b> 11</b>  <b> into splinters</b>  -That it shall be splintered into fine chips. <b> chips</b>  -Larger than splinters.

In this manner did Jonathan  render: And he shall smite the large  kingdom with a mighty blow, and the small kingdom with a weak blow.  <b> 12</b>  <b> Will horses run on the rock</b>  -I.e, will they maintain their running when they change the order of  the world? <b> or will one plow</b>  -[I.e.] will a man [plow] with oxen on the rock, that you think to pervert  the good way and survive and prosper?  <b> 13</b>  <b> over a thing of naught</b> - Over their greatness and their wealth, which is nought, since it will not  endure. <b> horns</b>  -Strength and might to gore the poor and needy with the horns.  <b> 14</b>  <b> from the approach to Hamath</b>  -which is in the northwestern corner of Eretz Israel. <b> brook of the Arabah</b>  -The brook of Egypt, which is in the southwestern corner.   <b> Chapter 7</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Thus... showed me</b>  -retribution, that He wished to bring locusts. <b> up of the latter growth</b>  [Heb.  לקש , an expression of the latter rain  (מלקוש)  when the grain shoots up  in its stalk. <b> and behold the latter growth</b>  -was growing. <b> after the kings mowings</b>  -After they mowed  the kings grains. Before it would shoot up in its stalk, they would mow it [as] young corn  (שחת)  to feed  the cattle, and so did Jonathan  render it: [After] the kings young corn  (שחתא)  was mown. This is a  mishnaic expression. (Menachoth  10:8) "One may cut young corn  (שחת)  and feed the cattle.  <b> 2</b>  <b> And it came to pass when it finished</b>  Heb.  אם .

The lead by which the builder of the walls looks to straighten the  row of stones. Here, too, it is an expression of the plumbline of justice. [from Teshuvoth Dunash , p.12]  <b> 8</b>  <b> Behold I place a plumbline</b>  -Behold I judge them with the line of strict justice. <b> pardon them</b>  -to  wait for them for their transgressions.  <b> 9</b>  <b> and the sanctuaries of Israel</b>  -That is Bethel, as it is said: (verse 13) "For it is the sanctuary of a  king. <b> upon the house of Jeroboam</b>  -son of Joash.  <b> 10</b>  <b> the priest of Bethel</b>  -A priest of the idols.  <b> 11</b>  <b> Jeroboam shall die by the sword</b>  -But he did not say that, only, And I will rise upon the house of  Jeroboam," and that refers to his son, Zechariah, who was assassinated by Shallum son of Jabesh (II  Kings 15).  <b> 12</b>  <b> Seer</b>  -You, who prophesy the future. <b> go, run away to the land of Judah</b>  -for there is the  sanctuary of the Holy One, blessed be He, in Whose Name you prophesy. <b> and eat bread there</b>  -This  is an expression of derision. He said to him, There they will give you crumbs of bread as pay for what  you prophesy.  <b> 13</b>  <b> But do not continue to prophesy in Bethel</b>  -for here they mention only the name of the idols.  <b> 14</b>  <b> I am neither a prophet</b>  -I am not one of your false prophets, who take pay for prophesying. I do  not need all this, and I never behaved in that manner, for I am wealthy and an owner of cattle and  property, as Jonathan  renders: For I am an owner of cattle and I have sycamores in the plain. <b> herder</b>  Heb.  בוקר  <b> and an inspector of sycamores</b>  Heb.  ובולס . One who searches the sycamores to  see which one has reached its time to cut in order to increase the branches, and which one is fit for  beams, for so was the custom to cut the virgin sycamores.  ובולס  is like  ובולש , a searcher, but Amos  was a stammerer, for so they said: Why was he named Amos? Because he was burdened  (עמוס)  by  his tongue, and Israel would call him pesilus (Greek for tongue-tied) as it is stated in Pesikta . [from Pesikta de-Rav Kahana  p.125]  <b> 16</b>  <b> and do not prophesy</b>  [Heb..  ולאתטיף . It is an expression of prophecy, and there are many in  Scripture, e.g. (Ezekiel 21:2) And prophesy  (והטף)  to the south.   <b> Chapter 8</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> a basket of late figs</b>  Heb.  כלוב . A basket full of late figs, which are not good  <b> 3</b>  <b> And the songs of the temple</b>  -which they sing within their temples at their banquets. <b> increase</b>  -The corpses of the slain shall increase.

They anticipate the time  that the grain will be expensive and will be sold to the poor with interest, and they will take their  fields. <b> the month be delayed</b>  Heb.  יעבר . Jonathan  renders: When will the year be interpolated and  [when] will the month of interpolation come? This is an expression of delay, like (Jer. 46:17) Has  allowed the appointed time to pass by  (העביר) . And because they delay the offering up of the Omer,  and the year is extended, and the old grain becomes expensive. <b> will open grain</b>  -When will the Sabbatical Year come, and the grain will become expensive, and we  will open our storehouses of grain. <b> to make the ephah smaller</b>  To sell for a smaller measure, and our  money we will receive with a large shekel.  <b> 6</b>  <b> in order to inherit them</b>  Heb.  בעבור נעלים .

And in another place (9:5),  Scripture says: And it shall come up wholly like the river  (כיאר) , and Jonathan  renders them both  identically: And a king shall rise upon it with his camp as numerous as the waters of the river, and  cover it completely. To me, it seems difficult to define  כאר  like  כיאר . It can, however be explained like:  (Job 36:32) On the clouds, the rain  (אור)  is covered. (Job 37:11)  He scatters his rain cloud  (אורו)  . And it shall go up wholly like a rain cloud, pitch darkness. <b> river of Egypt</b>  -The Nile overflows once in forty years and waters the land, and when it overflows, it  brings up mud and dirt on its banks, and when it returns from watering, it returns over its banks and its  water sinks. And that is called sinking, for the dirt that makes the water murky, settles. <b> cast up</b>  Heb.  ונגרשה , Like (Isa. 57:20) And its waters cast up  (ו יגרשו)  mud and dirt. Also the  land will spew out the wicked in its midst, and afterwards it will rest.  <b> 9</b>  <b> I will cause the sun to set at midday</b>  -When there will be exceeding tranquility, a sudden downfall  will come and our Rabbis said: This refers to the day of Josiah who died by the peaceful sword as  our Rabbis said: There was no more peaceful sword than Pharaoh-Neco who said to Josiah, (II Chron.  35:21) What do I have to do with you, O king of Judah; not upon you yourself today. Not upon you  do I come today, but to pass through your land to the house against which I wage war etc. [from Moed Katan , Taanith  22a] <b> the sun</b>  -The kingdom of the house of David is compared to the sun, as it is  said: (Psalms 89:37) And his throne is like the sun opposite Me.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And I will turn your festivals into mourning</b>  -as the matter is stated: (II Chron 35:24) And all  Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. <b> and all your songs into lamentation</b>  -as the matter is  stated: (ibid. verse 25) And all the singing men and singing women spoke in their lamentations. <b> the mourning for an only son</b>  -Like a father who mourns over an only son.  <b> 11</b>  <b> but to hear</b>  -for the holy spirit shall terminate from them.  <b> 13</b>  <b> shall faint</b>  Heb.  תתעלפנה . Their spirit shall fly out. Cf.

And the sideposts shall quake, meaning that the Temple will be destroyed,  and the Courtyards will be demolished.  ובצעם בראש כלם , meaning that the vessels of the Temple will  go into captivity.  ובצעם  means their money shall go into exile at the head of all of them.  <b> 2</b>  <b> If they dig down into the grave</b>  -If they think to hide in Sheol. <b> My hand shall take them</b>  -Their  enemies shall take them with My word. -[from Jonathan ] <b> and if they ascend to the heavens</b>  -And if  they ascend to the lofty mountains up to the heavens, from there they shall bring them down with My  word.  <b> 3</b>  <b> at the peak of Carmel</b>  -At the top of the towers of the fortifed cities.

And the Lord is He Who touches the land and it quakes. I.e, this decree emanates from Me.  <b> 6</b>  <b> and... His company</b>  -The company of His creatures. Another explanation: The company of the  righteous was the foundation of the earth and the ceiling [other editions: and the benefit] of the  heavens, for whose sake everything exists. <b> Who calls the water of the sea</b>  -Who says to gather camps  as numerous as the waters of the sea. [from Jonathan ]  <b> 7</b>  <b> Are you not like the children of the Cushites to Me</b>  -Why should I refrain from exacting  retribution upon you since you do not return to Me?

So will you be able to improve. <b> Did I not</b>  -Was it not out of My goodness,  the beginning of My choosing you, My taking you out of the land of Egypt? Now what is that to Me?  The Philistines, too, I took out of Caphtor in such a manner when the Caphtorites came upon the  Avvites, as the matter is stated (Deut. 2:23) And the Avvites who lived in open towns up to Gaza  etc. They vanquished also the people of Gaza and the remaining lords of the Philistines under them,  and I took them out of their hands, and, even so, I did not make them My people. <b> and Aram from Kir </b> -And so am I destined to bring Aram up from Kir, where Sennacherib will exile them, and, at the end  of days, when the kingdom of Assyria will terminate, they will go out.  <b> 8</b>  <b> and I will destroy it</b>  -The kingdom is the house of Jehu, but I will not destroy the house of Jacob.  <b> 9</b>  <b> For behold I command</b>  -to exile them among all the nations, an unusually great scattering. <b> shaken</b>  -What they sift with a sieve after the fine bran falls out of it, and there remains the coarse  [bran], which cannot come out, and then the one who shakes [it], shakes with all his might. <b> shaken</b>  -by another, and it is impossible to read  ינוע , since that denotes a thing that moves by itself.  <b> 10</b>  <b> The evil shall not soon come upon us.</b>  -Because of our iniquities, the evil shall not hasten to  approach and to come.  <b> 11</b>  <b> On that day</b>  -And, after all these will befall him, that day will come, the day destined for the  redemption, and thereon... <b> I will raise up the fallen Tabernacle of David</b>  - Jonathan  renders: the  kingdom of the house of David.  <b> 12</b>  <b> In order that they inherit</b>  -[I.e, in order that] Israel [inherit] the remnant of Edom etc. <b> My Name is called upon them</b>  Heb.  אשר , like  כי , because.  <b> 13</b>  <b> that the plowman shall meet the reaper</b>  -(Lev. 26:5) And your threshing shall overtake the  vintage, and the vintage shall overtake the sowing. They will not finish plowing until the harvest  comes, and they will not finish harvesting until the time of sowing comes. <b> shall melt</b>  Heb.  תתמוגגנה .

And here,  it is as follows: I have already behaved toward them according to My standard, to forgive them for  three transgressions, and if there are more, surely the smaller number is included in the larger amount. <b> yea for four I will not return them</b>  -For the fourth transgression, I need no longer return him empty-  handed from taking his recompense from Me, and surely since there are many transgressions in their  hands; now I will visit upon them the retribution for threshing the inhabitants of Gilead, their  neighbors. <b> with sledges of iron</b>  - Jonathan  renders: morigin  of iron.

And so did the people of Tyre, and so to the four sides during the destruction  of the Second Temple, as is delineated in the Aggadah of Haazinu (Sifre  322), Gaza from the south,  Tyre from the north, Damascus from the east, the Arabs from the west, as it is stated: (Isaiah 21:  13) The harsh prophecy concerning Arabia: In the forest in Arabia did you lodge, on the roads of  your cousins.  <b> 8</b>   Ashdod...

Rabbah 83:3]   <b> 13</b>  <b> they ripped up the pregnant woman of Gilead</b>  -They destroyed it and also ripped up their  pregnant women so that no heir would remain who would contest the inheritance.

Jonathan  renders in two places [here and below 8:6]: in order  to inherit. And I say that this is its explanation. They pervert the judgment of the poor man so that he  will be compelled to sell his field that he had between the fields of the judges, and this one seeks an  opportunity and takes it for a cheap price in order to fence in and lock all his fields together, and it  should not intervene between them.  <b> 7</b>  <b> Who aspire on the dust of the earth</b>  -On the dust of the earth, when they walk on it, all their  aspiration and all their thoughts are concerning the head of the poor, how they will rob them and take  their property.  ש איפה  is goloser  in O.F., aspiring. <b> and they pervert the way of the humble etc.</b>  -The  weak turn away from their way and go on a tortuous way because of fear of them, as Scripture says:  (Job 24:4) They turn the poor from the way. <b> to the maid</b>  -I.e, a betrothed maid.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And they recline on pledged garments</b>  - Jonathan  renders: On couches of a pledge they dine. They  settle [the charge as] a loan upon the poor. and they take a pledge from them, and make their garments  into couches and recline on them at the time of their meal. <b> they recline</b>  -An expression of dining, for  all their meals were eaten while leaning, for he would lean on his left side. <b> ones</b>  -from whom they would exact money for fines and drink wine with it. <b> in the house of their god</b>  -  In the house of the idol that they had beside the altar.  <b> 9</b>  <b> as oaks</b>  Heb.  אלונים , kesnes (chenes) in French. <b> his fruit from above</b>  -I.e, the celestial princes.

Another explanation: the wasp would blind their eyes from above and  castrate them from below. [from Sotah  36a]  <b> 11</b>  <b> as Nazirites</b>  - Jonathan  renders: as teachers. For they were separated from the ways of the people of  the land and were engaged in the Torah. The expression  נזירה  is everywhere only an expression of  separation. <b> Is this not so?</b>  -This is a rhetorical question. I.e, can you deny this?  <b> 12</b>  <b> And you gave the Nazirites to drink wine</b>  -lest they instruct you, for a drunken man is forbidden  to instruct. <b> And you gave the Nazirites to drink wine</b>  - Jonathan  renders: And you misled your  teachers with wine. <b> Do not prophesy.</b>  -Amaziah the priest of Bethel commanded Amos in this  manner: (Amos 7:12) Seer, go, flee to the land of Judah.  <b> 13</b>  <b> Behold I will oppress</b>  Heb.  מעיק , the Aramaic translation of  מציק , <b> your dwelling place</b>  Heb.  תחתיכם . Your camping place <b> as a wagon... is oppressed</b>  from the weight of the burden that is  upon it.  <b> 15</b>  <b> and the fleet-footed shall not deliver</b>  -himself.  <b> 16</b>  <b> shall flee naked</b>  -Naked without weapons.   <b> Chapter 3</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> Only you did I love</b>  Heb.  ידעתי , lit., I knew. I loved you, but you rebelled against Me; therefore,...  But our Sages expounded on it in a different manner in Tractate Avodah Zarah  (4a).  <b> 3</b>  <b> Will two walk together</b>  -Concerning what you say to the prophets, Do not prophesy, do the  prophets prophesy from their own mind unless they were commanded? Are things done in any way but  in their customary fashion? <b> unless they agree</b>  -Unless they made an appointment to go together to  such and such a place.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Will a lion roar in the forest if he has no prey</b>  -When a lion lays hold of its prey, it customarily  roars, and it does not roar unless it has taken [prey]. Similarly, Scripture states: (Isa. 5:29) He will  roar like the lion cubs, and he will growl and lay hold of prey. Similarly, (ibid. 31:4) As a lion or a  young lion growls over his prey.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Will a bird fall on a net upon the ground unless it has a snare</b>  -in the net which has fallen upon  it? <b> Will a net ascend from the ground</b>  -from the place it was laid unless a bird was caught in it?  When it wishes to escape, it pulls up the net and lifts it from its place a little, and at that time it is  caught.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Will a shophar be sounded</b>  -For the lookout sees troops approaching the city and sounds the  shophar to warn the people. These are but words of allegory and similitude, [to be explained as  follows:] <b> [4] Will a lion roar</b>  -That is Nebuchadnezzar. Another explanation: The prophets compare  the holy spirit that comes upon them from the roar of a lion, as he states below: (verse 8) A lion has  roared; who will not fear? And here he explains the allegory. Did the Holy One, blessed be He, bring  the holy spirit into the mouths of the prophets to [prophesy] evil unless retribution was decreed by  Him? That is the prey. Will the Holy One, blessed be He, let out a cry to speak harshly unless He has  taken you with the snare of iniquity? Will a bird fall on a net that the net will not snare it? I.e, is it  possible that you commit sins and it will not be a snare to you? Will a net ascend etc.? Similarly, will  your iniquities ascend on high and not take you? Will a shophar be sounded in the city?... So should  you quake before the words of the prophets who look out for you to deliver you from the evil, that it  not come, and when the evil comes to you, should you not know that the Holy One, blessed be He,  does it to you because you did not take heed of His prophets?  <b> 7</b>  <b> For the Lord God does nothing unless He has revealed His secret</b>  -That secret to His servants,  the prophets.  <b> 8</b>  <b> A lion has roared; who will not fear?</b>  -So has the Holy One, blessed be He, spoken to the prophets  to prophesy. Who will not prophesy?  <b> 9</b>  <b> Announce</b>  -You Philistines and Egyptians, announce this and say in your palaces that they gather on  the mountains of Samaria, to see from atop the mountains into the midst of the city, their evil way.  <b> 10</b>  <b> right</b>  Heb.  נכחה , meaning straight. <b> violence and plunder</b>  -I.e, money of plunder.  <b> 11</b>  <b> An adversary, even round about the land</b>  -The adversary is prepared to come, and he will come  around this land.  <b> 12</b>  <b> As the shepherd saves</b>  -I.e, he saves little. <b> the cartilage of an ear</b>  Heb.  בדל . [from Jonathan ] <b> will the children of Israel... be saved</b>  I.e, very few people. <b> of a couch</b>  Heb.  בפאת מטה ובדמשק ערש . Jonathan  renders: with the strength of rule and trusting in  Damascus. I say that the interpretation of the Targum  is as follows: Since, in the days of Jehoahaz son  of Jehu it is written. (II Kings 13:7) For the king of Aram had destroyed them, and Jeroboam his  grandson saved them partially, as it is said. (ibid. 14:27) And the Lord did not speak to eradicate the  name of Israel from under the heavens, and He saved them through Jeroboam the son of Joash. (ibid.  verse 25) He restored the boundary of Israel. And that is the meaning of in the corner of a  bed. The corner of a house is the strongest part of the house. Therefore, he translates. with the  strength of rule of Jeroboam, and Amos prophesied in the days of Jeroboam. He further prophesied  that they would eventually rely on the kings of Aram, and so they did in the days of Pekah son of  Remaliah. This is the meaning of  ובדמשק ערש , and their couch will be Damascus. Their rest and trust  will be on Damascus. And our Sages said in Seder Olam  (ch. 22) Rabbi Nehorai said in the name of  Rabbi Joshua: These are the ten tribes, which relied on Hezekiah, and on Judah, and escaped with  them. <b> in the corner of a bed</b>  -This teaches us that only one eighth of them was left. And the rest of  the couch -where was it? In Damascus, to fulfill what is stated: (below 5:27) And I will exile you  beyond Damascus. And I heard in the name of Rabbi Menahem of blessed memory, that he  explained. This is one eighth, since it is not stated. the corner of; but in the corner of a bed, in part  of it, in one of the two ends of a corner. That is an eighth of the bed, for it has four corners, and two  ends of each corner. [This is Rabbi Menahems explanation of Seder Olam  ch. 22. This is probably  Rabbi Menahem ben Helbo, the author of Pithronim .] Another explanation I found in the words of  Rabbi Meir of blessed memory, as follows: <b> In the corner of a bed</b>  -Because of the sin of Ahaziah son  of Ahab, who sent to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this  illness (I Kings 1:2). <b> and in Damascus is the couch</b>  -Ben-hadad, king of Aram, sent to inquire of the  God of Israel (ibid. ch. 8).  <b> 15</b>  <b> the winter house with the summer house</b>  -Since they were delicate, the wealthy people would  build for themselves two houses, one for the winter and one for the summer. <b> ivory houses</b>  -Which  are paneled with ivory. [from Jonathan ]   <b> Chapter 4</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> cows of Bashan</b>  -This refers to the wives of the princes and the officers. Jonathan  renders: wealthy in  property.  <b> 2</b>  <b> and you shall be borne on shields</b>  Heb.  בצנות . And the nations shall bear you on their shields. <b> your posterity in fishing boats</b>  Heb.  בסירות דוגה . [Jonathan  renders:] And your daughters in  fishermens boats. That is a small boat used by fishermen, and, since it is small, he calls it  סיר , a pot,  and in Mishnaic Hebrew, it is called  דוגית  in Baba Bathra  73a. <b> your posterity</b>  Heb.  ואחריתכן , lit., your  end. Dunash ben Livrat (Teshuvoth  p. 50): We find a persons descendants called his end. Cf. (Daniel  11:4) And when he stands up, his kingdom shall be broken, and it shall be divided to the four winds  of the heaven, and not to his posterity  (לאחריתו) . I.e, he will not leave over his kingdom to his son.  <b> 3</b>  <b> And [through the] breaches they shall emerge, each woman straight before her</b>  -And in the  breaches of the wall they shall emerge there to flee. <b> each woman straight before her</b>  -In the breach  that she will find straight before her. Cf. (Josh. 6:5) And the people shall go up, every man opposite  him  (נגדו) , for there will be many breaches, and they will not find it necessary to search for  entrances. <b> and you shall cast off the haughtiness</b>  Heb.  ההרמונה . And you shall cast off yourselves the  haughtiness and the authority that you took. This is an Aramaism in the Talmud: (Baba Mezia  84)   הר  מנה דמ לכא , It is the kings command. And Jonathan  renders: And they shall exile you beyond the  טורי חר מיני  . They are the mountains of darkness, an expression of destruction  (חרם)  and waste.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Come to Bethel etc.</b>  -Like a man who says to a scoundrel, Do [as you please] until your measure  [of sin] is full. <b> and bring your sacrifices in the morning</b>  -The priests of Baal say to them, "Idolatry  is liberal and does not impose stringent regulations upon you. The Torah states: (Exodus 34:25) Shall  not stay overnight, but for idolatry, And bring in the morning.  The Torah states concerning  sacrifices of lesser sanctity: (Lev. 19:6) On the day of your sacrifice, it may be eaten, and on the  morrow,  but idolatry, after three days your tithes of cattle. The Torah states: (Lev. 2: 11) Leaven...  you shall not offer up, but idolatry, (verse 5) And offer up a thanksgiving offering of leaven.  The  Torah states: (Deut. 23:22) You shall not delay its payment, but idolatry, and proclaim and publish  the free will offerings. Proclaim: Whoever vowed and forgot, shall give it thought and  remember. (Yerushalemi, Avodah Zarah  1:1) And Jonathan  renders: And offer up from robbery. Cf. (Isa.  1: 17) "Strengthen the robbed  (חמוץ) ; (Psalms 71:3) From the hand of the unrighteous and the  robbers  (ומ חמץ) .  <b> 5</b>  <b> and proclaim and publish the freewill offerings</b>  -with a song, and say that this sacrifice is  desirable and acceptable as a freewill offering. So did Jonathan  render.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Cleanness of teeth</b>  Heb.  נקיון ש נים . Setting your teeth on edge. [I.e, they would have nothing to  eat, and their teeth would be set on edge.] Another explanation: cleanness of teeth. This denotes the  lack of meat, which goes between the teeth, as it is stated: (Num. 11:33) The meat was still between  their teeth.  <b> 7</b>  <b> when there were yet three months before the harvest</b>  -Until the harvest. I.e, three months before  the harvest. <b> field</b>  Heb.  חלקה , a fielded plain, campagne in French. <b> shall receive rain</b>  Heb.  תמטר , shall  be a place of rain. The master stated: Both of them are for a curse; this one will rot, and this one will  wither. [from Taanith  6b] <b> and the field upon which no rain shall fall</b>  -That will not show itself rained  upon.  <b> 9</b>  <b> the increase of your gardens</b>  -That you are engaged in increasing your gardens. <b> locust has devoured</b>  Heb.  יאכל , lit., shall devour. Has devoured.  <b> 10</b>  <b> after the manner of Egypt</b>  -Just as I sent upon you in the desert when you left Egypt. <b> captivity of your horses</b>  -For they slay the horses as well. <b> rise</b>  -The smell of your corpses would raise a stench, and I caused it to rise into your nostrils.  <b> 11</b>  <b> like a brand</b>  Heb.  כאוד , tison in French, an ember; i.e, black and dark and burnt black.  <b> 12</b>  <b> Therefore</b>  -Since you did not return to Me. <b> because I will do this to you</b>  -as all these evils. <b> because</b>  -Since you hear from the mouth of My prophets that I will do this to you, prepare to meet Me,  to repent of your wickedness.  <b> 13</b>  <b> what his speech is</b>  -All his deeds are related in detail before him at the time of his death. <b> makes dawn</b>  -for the righteous like a bright light. <b> darkness</b>  -He turns the brightness of the wicked into  darkness. Cf. (Isa. 8:22) And behold, distress and darkness, darkness  (מעוף)  of  oppression. Similarly, (Job 10:22) Land of darkness  (עפתה)  ; (ibid. 11:17) Darkness  (תעפה)  shall  be like morning. Your darkness shall shine like the morning. <b> earth</b>  -He humbles the high and haughty.   <b> Chapter 5</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> The virgin of Israel</b>  -When they are exiled in the days of Hoshea son of Elah (II Kings 17:1-6), a  king will never again rise from the ten tribes. <b> she is spread out on her soil</b>  Heb.  נטשה . Anything that  is cast, lying, and spread out upon the field is called  נטישה .  <b> 3</b>  <b> that gives forth a thousand</b>  Heb.  היצאת , that gives forth a thousand men.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Seek Me and live</b>  -Perform the pilgrimage to pay your vows in Jerusalem.  <b> 5</b>  <b> But seek not Bethel etc. nor pass Beersheba</b>  -Here it does not say, You shall not come, or You  shall not seek, but, You shall not pass. This teaches us that there was no idol worship there, but as  long as one of the members of the ten tribes would go out to seek and did not yet pass Beersheba, he  could still turn to the Temple, to Jerusalem, and once he passed Beersheba, that is the way to the calf  in Bethel or to the calf in Dan. And so Scripture states: (infra 8:14) As your god, O Dan, lives, and as  the way of Beersheba lives. And you should know [that this is so], for Scripture pronounced decrees  of retribution on Gilgal and Bethel, and did not decree upon Beersheba. <b> for Gilgal shall be exiled</b>  -  According to its name is its curse. And, similarly, there is a city near Bethel named Beth-aven in the  Book of Joshua (7:2). <b> shall become nought</b>  Heb.  לאון . [Jonathan  renders:]  ללמא , which is the Aramaic  translation of  הבל , vanity, and this is a similarity to (Hosea 12: 12) If Gilead is nought, it is because  they are but futility.  <b> 6</b>  <b> lest He break out like fire</b>  Heb.  יצלח . Lest His anger ascend as fire to the house of Joseph. <b> house of Joseph</b>  -Like  לבית יוסף , to the house of Joseph.  <b> 7</b>  <b> Those who turn justice to wormwood</b>  -and they do not remember My conversions, that I turn etc.  <b> 8</b>  <b> and turns darkness into morning</b>  -There are some who live now in darkness, for whom I made it  light. <b> and day He darkens as night</b>  -There is one for whom the time is favorable as the light of day,  and I darken it as the night. <b> He Who calls the water of the sea</b>  - Jonathan  renders: He Who said to  gather camps as numerous as the water of the sea, and scatter them upon the face of the earth. And  our Sages explained it as a reference to the generation of Enosh, when He caused the water of the  ocean to inundate them. [from Mid. Psalms  88:2, Gen. Rabbah  23:7] <b> the Lord is His Name</b>  -They should  have worshipped Him, and He would have given them power over their enemies.  <b> 9</b>  <b> Who strengthens</b>  Heb.  המבליג , Who strengthens. Like (Job 10:20) And I will gain strength  (ואבליגה)  a little while; (Jer. 8:18) Were I to suppress  (מבליגיתי)  my grief. <b> the robbed</b>  Heb.  ושד . A person who was robbed and weak [Jonathan  renders:] Who strengthens the weak over the  strong, and the robbed He gives rule over strong walled cities.  <b> 10</b>  <b> They hated him who reproves them in the gate</b>  -You do not fear Him or His prophets, and you  hated those who reprove you in the gates of the courts.  <b> 11</b>  <b> you have trodden</b>  Heb.  בושסכם , like  בוססכם , you have trodden on the poor, that you trample and  tread on his head. Like (Jer. 12:10) They have trampled  (בוססו)  My field. <b> you take</b>  -The settling of the balance as a loan, that you raised the market price for them immediately  to sell them grain with interest, in order to take their estate from them. Therefore, houses and  vineyards that you have built and planted on those estates shall not remain in your hands. <b> burden</b>  Heb.  משאת , an expression of  משא , a burden, which they make heavy upon them. <b> vineyards</b>  Heb.  כרמי חמד .  <b> 12</b>  <b> you who oppress the just</b>  -[Jonathan  renders:] who oppress the innocent. <b> gate</b>  -In the gates of your courts, they turned aside the judgment of the needy.  <b> 13</b>  <b> the prudent</b>  -Whoever is wise shall keep silent when the evil comes, and he shall not criticize the  Divine standard of justice, for they did all these. <b> for it is a time of evil</b>  -[I.e.] a time destined [for  them] to receive their evil.  <b> 14</b>  <b> and so... shall be etc.</b>  -If you do this, the Omnipresent shall be with you as you said in your heart,  that you will keep your greatness.  <b> 15</b>  <b> the remnant of Joseph</b>  -All Israel are called by his name because he sustained them.  <b> 16</b>  <b> Alas! Alas!</b>  Heb.  הו הו , an expression of a cry. <b> and they shall meet the plowman with mourning </b> Heb.  וקראו . They shall meet companies of plowmen, plowing in the fields, with the voice of the  lamentation of the mourners crying in the streets. <b> and lamentation with those who know to wail</b>  -  [Jonathan  renders:] And the one who makes a lamentation shall meet one who makes a wailing. And  this is only a repetitious expression. Cf. (Ps. 9:5) My right and my cause  (משפטי ודיני) .  <b> 18</b>  <b> Woe to those who desire etc.</b>  -Those who say, Let Him hurry; let Him hasten His deed. (Isa. 5:  19) <b> Why would you have etc.</b>  -There is a parable concerning a rooster and a bat that were awaiting  the dawn, as appears in the chapter entitled  Chelek .  <b> 21</b>  <b> [the sacrifices of] your assemblies</b>  -[Jonathan  renders:] The sacrifice of your assemblies; i.e, when  you call an assembly.  <b> 22</b>  <b> and the peace offerings of your fattened cattle</b>  Heb.  שלם מריאיכם , the peace offerings of your  fatlings, i.e, fattened cattle.  <b> 23</b>  <b> Take away from Me the din of your songs</b>  -that the Levites sing on the platform, since you are  robbers and perverters of justice.  <b> 24</b>  <b> And justice shall be revealed like water</b>  Heb.  ויגל . And you shall do this, and I will accept you.  The justice that you have hidden and concealed shall be revealed and stream among you like water.  [after Jonathan ] <b> and righteousness</b>  -shall be revealed like a mighty stream. [after Jonathan ]  <b> 25</b>  <b> Did... sacrifices and meal offerings</b>  -Is My desire for sacrifices and meal offerings? Is it not so  that in the desert I did not speak with your forefathers to offer up sacrifices to Me? I said: (Lev. 1:  2) Should a man sacrifice, when he wishes to sacrifice. And Scripture states: (Num. 9:2) And the  children of Israel shall make the Passover sacrifice in its time. This tells us that Israel made only that  Passover sacrifice. [based on Sifre  to Num. 9:2]  <b> 26</b>  <b> And you shall carry Siccuth your king</b>  -He returns to the matter of the retribution [mentioned]  above. The day of the Lord is darkness for you, and not light, and you shall carry your idols into exile  with you. The enemies shall load them on your necks to carry them with you into exile.  Siccuth...  Chiun... Kochav  -They are names of pagan deities.  <b> 27</b>  <b> And I will exile you beyond Damascus</b>  -I.e, you shall not be exiled to your neighbors as  heretofore, that you were delivered into the hands of the kings of Aram [In Nach Lublin-Edom, an  obvious error] and they did not take you in captivity to a distant place, but to Damascus. From now  on, I will deliver you into the hands of Sennacherib, and he shall exile you far away.   <b> Chapter 6</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> those called the first of the nations</b>  -You were called the most praiseworthy of the nations. <b> house of Israel has come to them</b>  -They chose the ordinances of the nations and came to be included  among them.  <b> 2</b>  <b> Proceed to Calneh and see</b>  -Why have you rejected My Torah to cleave to the ordinances of the  nations? Go over and see the prominent nations, whether they are better than these kingdoms which  are in Samaria and in Jerusalem. <b> or is their border greater than your border</b>  -So what wrong have  you found in Me? <b> Calneh</b>  -Babylon. <b> Hamath</b>  -Antioch. <b> Gath of the Philistines</b>  -The most prominent  of their five lords, called Metheg-ammah, ox-goad, since it ruled over all of them, and that was  the mother of the kingdom.  <b> 3</b>  <b> You, who bring yourselves near to the day of evil</b>  -You who cause yourselves to move to the day  of evil. <b> and you bring near</b>  -You bring yourselves near to dwell in the exile of Esau your brother who  robs you, as it is said: (Obadiah 1:10) From the violence of your brother Jacob. This is the midrash  of Rabbi Simon of blessed memory. [Note that this is also found in Lev. Rabbah  5:3.] Another  explanation. <b> You who despise the day of evil</b>  -You who despise the prophecy of the days of evil,  which the prophets prophesy to them. <b> and you bring near a dwelling of violence</b>  -This is as Isaiah  states: (5:8) " Woe to those who join a house to a house. You bring near dwelling in their midst one  beside the other through violence.  <b> 4</b>  <b> and stretch out on their beds</b>  Heb.  וסרחים . They spread themselves out and stretch themselves out  on their beds. Our Sages, however, explained that they would exchange wives with one another and  befoul their beds with semen that is not theirs. [from Shabbath  62b] <b> lambs</b>  Heb.  כרים  Lambs. <b> the stall</b>  -The place where the calves are gathered, and in O.F. kopled , a pen.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Who sing according to the tone of the lute</b>  -Menahem (Machbereth Menahem  p. 145) classifies it with  (Lev. 19:10) And the single grapes  (ופרט)  of your vineyard," and I approve of his view, for the one  who sings with a musical instrument separates the speech individually, everything according to the  tone of the instrument, whether to raise [the note] or to lower [it]. <b> instruments were like [those of] David</b>  -They thought their musical instruments were like the musical  instruments of your servant David, which were meant for the sake of Heaven, but these were for  enjoyment.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Who drink from basins of wine</b>  Heb.  במזרקי . Some of our Sages state in Tractate Shabbath  (62b)  that they would throw their cups to each other, and some explain that this was the name of a vessel  that had two mouths, and it was long, and one would drink from here and one from here, it would be  cast from this ones mouth to this ones mouth. <b> and with the first oils</b>  -The best of the oils, which is  balsamum. <b> and they feel no pain</b>  Heb.  ולא נחלו , an expression of illness. <b> destruction of Joseph</b>  -For they heard from the prophet that it was destined to befall them.  <b> 7</b>  <b> and the banquet of the haughty shall pass away</b>  Heb.  וסר מרזח סרוחים . And the banquets of the  aggrandized and the haughty shall be abolished.  מרזח  is an expression of banquets. In Sifre , in the  section commencing: (Num. 25:1) And Israel sojourned in Shittim," I found: And they returned to  make  מרזחים  for them, and they would invite them, and they would eat.  <b> 8</b>  <b> by Himself</b>  -With knowledge and intention. <b> abhor</b>  Heb.  מתאב . Like  מתעב  And so did Jonathan  render  it: I abhor the Temple, the greatness of Jacob. For the Temple is called the pride of their strength, as is  stated: (Ezekiel 24:21) Behold I profane My Sanctuary, the pride of your strength. <b> fullness thereof</b>  -Jerusalem and its inhabitants.  <b> 9</b>  <b> if... are left</b>  -from the pestilence and the sword in one house, they shall die, for the enemies shall  burn the house upon them when they take the city.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And his kinsman and the one who saved him from burning shall carry him</b>  -His kinsman and  his friend who saved his bones from the fire. In this manner, Jonathan  rendered it: And his kinsman  shall carry him out of the fire. <b> and he shall say</b>  I.e, the one who takes [the bodies] out of the fire. <b> to </b> [the one] <b> who is in the end of the house</b>  -I.e, to his friend who went to search within the house. <b> there any more with you?"</b>  -Is there any living person besides you who escaped among the hidden  ones? <b> and he shall say, "There is none.</b>  -There is no living one, only dead. And this one says to him,  "Take out the corpses.  הס , Cast out and eliminate everything. For this comes to them because they  did not want to mention the Name of the Lord. In this manner, Jonathan  rendered it.  <b> 11</b>  <b> into splinters</b>  -That it shall be splintered into fine chips. <b> chips</b>  -Larger than splinters. According to  its prominence, shall be its destruction. In this manner did Jonathan  render: And he shall smite the large  kingdom with a mighty blow, and the small kingdom with a weak blow.  <b> 12</b>  <b> Will horses run on the rock</b>  -I.e, will they maintain their running when they change the order of  the world? <b> or will one plow</b>  -[I.e.] will a man [plow] with oxen on the rock, that you think to pervert  the good way and survive and prosper?  <b> 13</b>  <b> over a thing of naught</b> - Over their greatness and their wealth, which is nought, since it will not  endure. <b> horns</b>  -Strength and might to gore the poor and needy with the horns.  <b> 14</b>  <b> from the approach to Hamath</b>  -which is in the northwestern corner of Eretz Israel. <b> brook of the Arabah</b>  -The brook of Egypt, which is in the southwestern corner.   <b> Chapter 7</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Thus... showed me</b>  -retribution, that He wished to bring locusts. <b> up of the latter growth</b>  [Heb.  לקש , an expression of the latter rain  (מלקוש)  when the grain shoots up  in its stalk. <b> and behold the latter growth</b>  -was growing. <b> after the kings mowings</b>  -After they mowed  the kings grains. Before it would shoot up in its stalk, they would mow it [as] young corn  (שחת)  to feed  the cattle, and so did Jonathan  render it: [After] the kings young corn  (שחתא)  was mown. This is a  mishnaic expression. (Menachoth  10:8) "One may cut young corn  (שחת)  and feed the cattle.  <b> 2</b>  <b> And it came to pass when it finished</b>  Heb.  אם . When it finished eating. <b> the grass of the earth</b>  -in  that field. <b> and I said, O Lord God!

The lead by which the builder of the walls looks to straighten the  row of stones. Here, too, it is an expression of the plumbline of justice. [from Teshuvoth Dunash , p.12]  <b> 8</b>  <b> Behold I place a plumbline</b>  -Behold I judge them with the line of strict justice. <b> pardon them</b>  -to  wait for them for their transgressions.  <b> 9</b>  <b> and the sanctuaries of Israel</b>  -That is Bethel, as it is said: (verse 13) "For it is the sanctuary of a  king. <b> upon the house of Jeroboam</b>  -son of Joash.  <b> 10</b>  <b> the priest of Bethel</b>  -A priest of the idols.  <b> 11</b>  <b> Jeroboam shall die by the sword</b>  -But he did not say that, only, And I will rise upon the house of  Jeroboam," and that refers to his son, Zechariah, who was assassinated by Shallum son of Jabesh (II  Kings 15).  <b> 12</b>  <b> Seer</b>  -You, who prophesy the future. <b> go, run away to the land of Judah</b>  -for there is the  sanctuary of the Holy One, blessed be He, in Whose Name you prophesy. <b> and eat bread there</b>  -This  is an expression of derision. He said to him, There they will give you crumbs of bread as pay for what  you prophesy.  <b> 13</b>  <b> But do not continue to prophesy in Bethel</b>  -for here they mention only the name of the idols.  <b> 14</b>  <b> I am neither a prophet</b>  -I am not one of your false prophets, who take pay for prophesying. I do  not need all this, and I never behaved in that manner, for I am wealthy and an owner of cattle and  property, as Jonathan  renders: For I am an owner of cattle and I have sycamores in the plain. <b> herder</b>  Heb.  בוקר  <b> and an inspector of sycamores</b>  Heb.  ובולס . One who searches the sycamores to  see which one has reached its time to cut in order to increase the branches, and which one is fit for  beams, for so was the custom to cut the virgin sycamores.  ובולס  is like  ובולש , a searcher, but Amos  was a stammerer, for so they said: Why was he named Amos? Because he was burdened  (עמוס)  by  his tongue, and Israel would call him pesilus (Greek for tongue-tied) as it is stated in Pesikta . [from Pesikta de-Rav Kahana  p.125]  <b> 16</b>  <b> and do not prophesy</b>  [Heb..  ולאתטיף . It is an expression of prophecy, and there are many in  Scripture, e.g. (Ezekiel 21:2) And prophesy  (והטף)  to the south.   <b> Chapter 8</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> a basket of late figs</b>  Heb.  כלוב . A basket full of late figs, which are not good  <b> 3</b>  <b> And the songs of the temple</b>  -which they sing within their temples at their banquets. <b> increase</b>  -The corpses of the slain shall increase. [from Jonathan ] <b> everywhere Cast away, remove!"</b>  -  Everywhere one will say, Cast away, remove! Cast away from here, remove these corpses from  here. [from Jonathan ]  <b> 4</b>  <b> you who swallow up</b>  Heb.  השאפים , who swallow up the needy. <b> and to cut off</b>  Heb.  ולשבית , like  ולהשבית . And examples [of this are found in Isaiah 23:11:] " To destroy  (לשמד)  its strongholds. (II  Kings 9:15) "To go and tell  (לגיד)  in Jezreel.  <b> 5</b>  <b> Saying, When will the month be delayed</b>  -This is the swallowing up. They anticipate the time  that the grain will be expensive and will be sold to the poor with interest, and they will take their  fields. <b> the month be delayed</b>  Heb.  יעבר . Jonathan  renders: When will the year be interpolated and  [when] will the month of interpolation come? This is an expression of delay, like (Jer. 46:17) Has  allowed the appointed time to pass by  (העביר) . And because they delay the offering up of the Omer,  and the year is extended, and the old grain becomes expensive. <b> will open grain</b>  -When will the Sabbatical Year come, and the grain will become expensive, and we  will open our storehouses of grain. <b> to make the ephah smaller</b>  To sell for a smaller measure, and our  money we will receive with a large shekel.  <b> 6</b>  <b> in order to inherit them</b>  Heb.  בעבור נעלים . [from Jonathan ] <b> sell</b>  -[Jonathan  renders:] And the sweepings of the grains we will sell. The refuse that fell from the  wheat into the sieve, to sell at high prices to the poor.  <b> 8</b>  <b> Shall the land not quake for this</b>  -Is this iniquity not serious enough that the land be destroyed  because of it? <b> Yea, it shall rise up wholly like the rain cloud</b>  Heb.  כאר . And in another place (9:5),  Scripture says: And it shall come up wholly like the river  (כיאר) , and Jonathan  renders them both  identically: And a king shall rise upon it with his camp as numerous as the waters of the river, and  cover it completely. To me, it seems difficult to define  כאר  like  כיאר . It can, however be explained like:  (Job 36:32) On the clouds, the rain  (אור)  is covered. (Job 37:11)  He scatters his rain cloud  (אורו)  . And it shall go up wholly like a rain cloud, pitch darkness. <b> river of Egypt</b>  -The Nile overflows once in forty years and waters the land, and when it overflows, it  brings up mud and dirt on its banks, and when it returns from watering, it returns over its banks and its  water sinks. And that is called sinking, for the dirt that makes the water murky, settles. <b> cast up</b>  Heb.  ונגרשה , Like (Isa. 57:20) And its waters cast up  (ו יגרשו)  mud and dirt. Also the  land will spew out the wicked in its midst, and afterwards it will rest.  <b> 9</b>  <b> I will cause the sun to set at midday</b>  -When there will be exceeding tranquility, a sudden downfall  will come and our Rabbis said: This refers to the day of Josiah who died by the peaceful sword as  our Rabbis said: There was no more peaceful sword than Pharaoh-Neco who said to Josiah, (II Chron.  35:21) What do I have to do with you, O king of Judah; not upon you yourself today. Not upon you  do I come today, but to pass through your land to the house against which I wage war etc. [from Moed Katan , Taanith  22a] <b> the sun</b>  -The kingdom of the house of David is compared to the sun, as it is  said: (Psalms 89:37) And his throne is like the sun opposite Me.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And I will turn your festivals into mourning</b>  -as the matter is stated: (II Chron 35:24) And all  Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. <b> and all your songs into lamentation</b>  -as the matter is  stated: (ibid. verse 25) And all the singing men and singing women spoke in their lamentations. <b> the mourning for an only son</b>  -Like a father who mourns over an only son.  <b> 11</b>  <b> but to hear</b>  -for the holy spirit shall terminate from them.  <b> 13</b>  <b> shall faint</b>  Heb.  תתעלפנה . Their spirit shall fly out. Cf. (Jonah 4:8) And he fainted  (ויתעלף)  . And so, (Ezekiel 31:15) The trees of the field fainted  (עלפה)  for him. And so in the language of  the Mishnah (Chullin  3b): He may faint  (נתעלפה) , pasmer, (pamer) in French.

[from Jonathan ] <b> Strike the lintel</b>  -which is on top of the roof. <b> and the sideposts shall quake</b>  -The lower doorposts of  the Temple; so will the king be slain and the princes quake. <b> head of all of them</b>  Heb.  ובצעם , like  ופצעם  [wound them or break them] And Jonathan  renders  כפתור  as the Menorah: [If the people of the house of Israel do not repent,] extinguish the Menorah;  King Josiah shall be slain. And the sideposts shall quake, meaning that the Temple will be destroyed,  and the Courtyards will be demolished.  ובצעם בראש כלם , meaning that the vessels of the Temple will  go into captivity.  ובצעם  means their money shall go into exile at the head of all of them.  <b> 2</b>  <b> If they dig down into the grave</b>  -If they think to hide in Sheol. <b> My hand shall take them</b>  -Their  enemies shall take them with My word. -[from Jonathan ] <b> and if they ascend to the heavens</b>  -And if  they ascend to the lofty mountains up to the heavens, from there they shall bring them down with My  word.  <b> 3</b>  <b> at the peak of Carmel</b>  -At the top of the towers of the fortifed cities.

And the Lord is He Who touches the land and it quakes. I.e, this decree emanates from Me.  <b> 6</b>  <b> and... His company</b>  -The company of His creatures. Another explanation: The company of the  righteous was the foundation of the earth and the ceiling [other editions: and the benefit] of the  heavens, for whose sake everything exists. <b> Who calls the water of the sea</b>  -Who says to gather camps  as numerous as the waters of the sea. [from Jonathan ]  <b> 7</b>  <b> Are you not like the children of the Cushites to Me</b>  -Why should I refrain from exacting  retribution upon you since you do not return to Me? Have you not come from the sons of Noah like  the other nations? Like the Cushites whom you resemble, as the matter is stated: (Jer. 13:22) Will a  Cushite change his skin? So will you be able to improve. <b> Did I not</b>  -Was it not out of My goodness,  the beginning of My choosing you, My taking you out of the land of Egypt? Now what is that to Me?  The Philistines, too, I took out of Caphtor in such a manner when the Caphtorites came upon the  Avvites, as the matter is stated (Deut. 2:23) And the Avvites who lived in open towns up to Gaza  etc. They vanquished also the people of Gaza and the remaining lords of the Philistines under them,  and I took them out of their hands, and, even so, I did not make them My people. <b> and Aram from Kir </b> -And so am I destined to bring Aram up from Kir, where Sennacherib will exile them, and, at the end  of days, when the kingdom of Assyria will terminate, they will go out.  <b> 8</b>  <b> and I will destroy it</b>  -The kingdom is the house of Jehu, but I will not destroy the house of Jacob.  <b> 9</b>  <b> For behold I command</b>  -to exile them among all the nations, an unusually great scattering. <b> shaken</b>  -What they sift with a sieve after the fine bran falls out of it, and there remains the coarse  [bran], which cannot come out, and then the one who shakes [it], shakes with all his might. <b> shaken</b>  -by another, and it is impossible to read  ינוע , since that denotes a thing that moves by itself.  <b> 10</b>  <b> The evil shall not soon come upon us.</b>  -Because of our iniquities, the evil shall not hasten to  approach and to come.  <b> 11</b>  <b> On that day</b>  -And, after all these will befall him, that day will come, the day destined for the  redemption, and thereon... <b> I will raise up the fallen Tabernacle of David</b>  - Jonathan  renders: the  kingdom of the house of David.  <b> 12</b>  <b> In order that they inherit</b>  -[I.e, in order that] Israel [inherit] the remnant of Edom etc. <b> My Name is called upon them</b>  Heb.  אשר , like  כי , because.  <b> 13</b>  <b> that the plowman shall meet the reaper</b>  -(Lev. 26:5) And your threshing shall overtake the  vintage, and the vintage shall overtake the sowing. They will not finish plowing until the harvest  comes, and they will not finish harvesting until the time of sowing comes. <b> shall melt</b>  Heb.  תתמוגגנה .
