Another explanation: Who is this who gives dark 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ counsel...without knowledge? Said the Holy One, blessed be He: Who is this who darkens counsel, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ frustrates words, i.e., with a multiplicity of words; for I wrote: “and that man was sincere and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ upright,” at the beginning of the Book, in order that My name should rest on Him, but he came and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ darkened and frustrated what I counseled with his many words. Whereupon Job replies to Him (below 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 42:3): “Who is this Who hides counsel?” Had I known Your counsel, I would not have spoken so 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ much. Then the Holy One blessed be He, answers him, “Neither did Abraham know; yet he passed 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ten” [tests]. So I found.
