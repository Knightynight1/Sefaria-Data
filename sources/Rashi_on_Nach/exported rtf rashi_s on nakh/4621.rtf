\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and another thousand, and they deepened up to the loins. From here on, it was a stream that I could 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ not cross. From here we learn that one should not enter water from the loins and higher, lest the water 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ over power him. As soon as he came to the water reaching the loins, he went out upon the bank of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ river and measured another thousand before him, a stream that cannot be crossed, and his feet were 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ standing on dry land. This is what is written (v. 6): “and he brought me back [upon] the bank of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ stream,” i.e., near the bank of the stream that is where he had been standing.
