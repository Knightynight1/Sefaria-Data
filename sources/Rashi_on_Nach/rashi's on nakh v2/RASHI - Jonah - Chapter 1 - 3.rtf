He said, “I will 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ flee to the sea, for the Shechinah does not rest outside the Holy Land.” Said the Holy One, blessed be 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ He, to him, “By your life, I have messengers like you to send after you and fetch you from there.” This 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is illustrated by an allegory of a priest’s slave who fled from his master and entered a cemetery 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [making it impossible for his master to retrieve him]. His master said to him, “I have slaves like you to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ send after you and fetch you from there.” Now what did Jonah see that he did not wish to go to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Nineveh? He said, “The gentiles are quick to repent. Should I prophesy to them and they repent, I will 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ be found condemning Israel, who do not heed the words of the prophets.” [from \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Mechilta\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , Exodus 12:1]

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ upon the sea to pay the hire of the ship until they leave, he paid in advance. [\lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Pirk&d’Rabbi Eliezer\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , ch.
