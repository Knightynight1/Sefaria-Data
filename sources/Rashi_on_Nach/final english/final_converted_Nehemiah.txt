<b> Nehemiah</b>  <b> Chapter 1</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> The words of Nehemiah, etc.</b>  Nehemiah wrote this book from here on. <b> the twentieth year</b>  This  refers to the twentieth year of King Darius, who is identical with Artaxerxes. In Tractate Rosh  Hashanah (3a, b), we find that the phrase the twentieth year is mentioned twice using similar  wording [to teach us that it is speaking of the identical year]. It states below (2:1), And it came to  pass in the month of Nissan of the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, etc. The years were calculated from  the month of Tishrei. It says here, And it was in the month of Kislev of the twentieth year, etc. This  refers to the Kislev coming after Tishrei. Further down it says (2:1), And it was in the month of  Nissan of the twentieth year, etc. This refers to the Nissan of the same year. And I cannot explain  that they calculated their years from the month of Nissan and that the incident mentioned below: And  it was in the month of Nissan, etc. occurred before this incident: And it was in the month of Kislev,  etc. It is true that events [in the Torah] are not necessarily recorded in chronological order.  Nevertheless, the chapters indicate that the second chapter took place only because of the events of  the first chapter.  <b> 2</b>  <b> one of my brethren</b>  one of my companions. <b> and I asked them about the Jews</b>  I asked them about  the Jews who had escaped the Babylonian captivity and remained in Jerusalem. <b> who had escaped </b> because they were saved from the Babylonian exile. <b> and about Jerusalem</b>  And I asked them about  the city.  <b> 3</b>  <b> And they said to me</b>  They answered my first question first and my latter question last; first,  concerning the Jews and afterwards, concerning the wall and the gates. <b> who remained</b>  Those Jews  who remained in the province of Jerusalem are in great trouble and reproach because the gentiles  plunder and pillage them. <b> and the wall of Jerusalem is breached</b>  And the wall of the city is breached,  and the gates are burned with fire as they were before, for Israel had not built the wall of the city or its  gates, only the Temple. <b> were burned</b>  Heb.  נצתו , like  נצתו .  <b> 4</b>  <b> for days</b>  Heb.  ימים , many days.  <b> 5</b>  <b> I beseech You</b>  Heb.  אנא , an expression of request and supplication.  <b> 6</b>  <b> attentive</b>  Heb.  קשבת , like  קושבת , listening, for just as one says from  אוהב ,  אהב , so does one say from  קשב  ,  קושב  and  קושבת .  <b> 7</b>  <b> We have dealt corruptly</b>  Heb.  חבל , a noun, an expression of corruption, since the heth is  vowelized with a hataf pattah, and I cannot interpret it as a verb form, because in that case, it would  have to be vowelized with a large kamatz. <b> we have dealt corruptly</b>  Heb.  חבלנו , an expression of  corruption, as in Daniel (6:23): I have done no harm.  <b> 9</b>  <b> if your exile is</b>  like the matter that is stated (Deut. 30:4): If your exile is at the end of the heavens,  etc.  <b> 11</b>  <b> I beseech You, O Lord, may Your ear now be attentive</b>  At the beginning of his prayer he used  this expression, and so after his prayer. <b> Your servant</b>  This is what he prayed for himself. <b> man</b>  before the king. <b> butler</b>  Heb.  משקה , like (Gen. 40:1): ...the butler of  (משקה)  the king of  Egypt. This is what I explained above (Ezra 2:63) according to the words of our Sages, that  Hattirshatha is Nehemiah.   <b> Chapter 2</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> of...Artaxerxes</b>  That was Darius, and because of his kingship he was called this. <b> wine before him </b> They brought wine before the king in the court. <b> and I carried the wine</b>  And I carried the cup of wine  and gave it to the king, and so is the custom, that the one who brings wine into the kings court does  not carry it and give it to the king, but the chief butler receives it from the hand of the one who brings  it, and carries it and gives it to the king. <b> And I had never been sad in his presence</b>  And I was not  accustomed to being sad in his presence, to have a sad face, but to be happy and cheerful, but now I  was sad with a sad face.  <b> 2</b>  <b> You are not ill</b>  Is it not so that you are not ill? <b> This is nothing</b>  This incident is only wickedness of  heart, that you have in your heart to put me to death by poisoning this cup. <b> frightened</b>  And I became very frightened about this, lest the king accuse me falsely.  <b> 3</b>  <b> Why should my countenance not be sad</b>  [as translated,] why should my countenance not be sad. <b> when the city</b>  Jerusalem, which is the place of the graves of my forefathers, is laid waste.  <b> 4</b>  <b> For what do you make request</b>  What do you request of me and I shall do it for you. <b> And I prayed </b> And I said before the king in my prayer, May it be Your will, O God of the heavens, that You fulfill  my petition and my request.  <b> 5</b>  <b> that you send me</b>  that you grant me permission to ascend to Jerusalem and build it.  <b> 6</b>  <b> And the king said to me</b>  At the time the king spoke to me, his wife, the queen, was sitting beside  him. <b> and the queen</b>  Heb.  והשגל , his wife the queen, as it is stated (Dan. 5:2): ...his queen  (שגלתה)  and  his concubine, for it is customary for Scripture to write the queen, next to the concubine; his  wives and his concubines, like (Song 6:9):   מלכות ופילגשים , queens and concubines.  <b> will your trip take</b>  When is it your intention to return? <b> and when will you return?</b>  When is it your  intention to return? <b> and he sent me</b>  He gave me permission to go. <b> and I gave him a time</b>  I gave him a  time of return.  <b> 7</b>  <b> may letters be given to me</b>  [Let] your scribes [give me letters] by your sanction and your  knowledge, sealed with your signet to the governors of the land beyond the river, on the side of the  land of Israel. <b> that they escort me through</b>  and escort me in peace. <b> until I come</b>  to Jerusalem, which  is in the province of Judea.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And a letter to Asaph</b>  and that you send a letter to Asaph. <b> the guardian of the kings orchard</b>  He  was appointed over the kings forests. <b> to make beams</b>  This is the intensive conjugation: to make  ceilings and beams for the gates of the castles of the Temple Mount, for they had built the Temple as it  should be built, but the gates of the walls of the Temple Mount and the wall for the court surrounding  the Temple had not yet been built. <b> and for the wall of the city</b>  and to make beams for the wall of the  city. <b> and for the house to which I shall go</b>  and to make a house in which I shall dwell for my needs. <b> and the king gave me</b>  all I asked him for. <b> according to the good hand</b>  according to the hand of the  Holy One, blessed be He, which was good upon me, to cause me to succeed.  <b> 9</b>  <b> and I gave them the kings letters</b>  in order that they escort me in peace. <b> horsemen</b>  the king sent with me [officers] in my honor, in order that I go in peace.  <b> 10</b>  <b> Now Sanballat etc., heard</b>  When they heard that I had come to request good for Israel and to  build the walls of Jerusalem it displeased them greatly, for they were the adversaries of Judah and  Benjamin.  <b> 11</b>  <b> and I was there for three days</b>  I was in Jerusalem for three days, and at the end of three days, I  and a few men with me arose at night, and I did not tell any person what the Holy One, blessed be He,  had put into my heart.  <b> 12</b>  <b> and there were no animals with me</b>  The few men who were with me went by foot and I alone  rode on an animal. They did not ride their horses because they wanted to leave the city in secret,  without anyone knowing. They went to break and cast down the walls of the city at night and to  increase their breaches in order that on the morrow, the people of the city would be eager and agree  unanimously with Nehemiah to build the walls of the city. So it appears from the text.  <b> 13</b>  <b> And I went out through the Gate of the Valley</b>  I went out through that gate at night with the men  who were with me toward En Hattannin and the Dung Gate in the wall of the city; and I broke the  wall, and the wall was easily cast down and broken because it had been burned with fire. <b> breached</b>  which are those places that were breached, and they breached them more.  <b> 14</b>  <b> And I passed to the Fountain Gate</b>  And I wished to pass to those places in the wall of the city and  in those breaches, and there was no place in those breaches for riders on animals to pass through  because they were so small.  <b> 15</b>  <b> And I ascended</b>  And I was ascending from one side at night, and I was breaking the wall with the  men who were with me. <b> and I returned and came</b>  And when I returned, I came by way of the Gate  of the Valley.  <b> 16</b>  <b> And the prefects</b>  who were in the city did not know where I had gone to and what I had done. <b> yet </b> Heb.  עד כן , until now.  <b> 17</b>  <b> And I said to them</b>  On the morrow I said to them. <b> and we shall no longer be a reproach</b>  that our  adversaries should not plunder and pillage us.  <b> 18</b>  <b> the hand of my God</b>  who gave me favor and success before the king. <b> for good</b>  They intended  everything for goodto build the wall of the city and its towers.  <b> 19</b>  <b> and they mocked</b>  When our adversaries heard the news of the building of the walls of the city,  they mocked us. <b> are...against the king</b>  Are you rebelling against the king by building the wall of the  city in order to rebel against him?  <b> 20</b>  <b> but you have no share</b>  What do you have in the building of the wall of this city, for you have no  share in it.   <b> Chapter 3</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> the Sheep Gate</b>  Such was the name of the gate. <b> they hallowed it</b>  that gate with the sanctity of the  city. <b> its doors</b>  i.e., of the gate. <b> and until the Tower of the Hundred</b>  Such was the name of the tower.  <b> 2</b>  <b> And next to it</b>  Next to it, near the Sheeps Gate, each builder built. <b> the men of Jericho built</b>  Such  was their custom, these would build here [their section] of the wall of the city until [the part] they  were responsible for was completed, and then others would build next to the first construction. Such  was their custom, one after another, until the entire wall was built. <b> And next</b>  As in (Num. 2:20) Next  to him, the tribe of Manasseh, near him, and such is its explanation, next to the construction, and  Scripture was not particular in its choice of words. Sometimes it says  ודי לע , and sometimes it says  וילו . And next to them he repaired.  <b> 3</b>  <b> the Fish Gate</b>  Such was the name of the gate. <b> they laid its beams</b>  They placed the beams and  ceilings on the gate. <b> they laid its beams</b>  Heb.  קרוהו  the intensive conjugation, like ...behold he laid  the beams  (קרה) , [which appears nowhere in Scripture;] similar to (Ps. 104:3): Who roofs  (המקרה)  His upper chambers with water. The kuf of  קרוהו  is not customarily vowelized with a hirik in  this context because of the resh following it, like (ibid. 10:3): blessed  (ברך)  ; (Prov. 17:  5): blasphemed  (חרף)  ; (Gen. 17:16): I shall bless her  (וברכתיה)  ;(Ezek. 29:12): and I shall scatter  them  (וזרתים)  in the lands.  its locks  מנעוליו , ses verrous in French, its bolts (locks).  <b> 4</b>  <b> repaired</b>  Heb.  החזיק , [lit. strengthened,] to build the building.  <b> 5</b>  <b> the Tekoites</b>  They were called this because of their place, which was Tekoa. <b> but their mighty men </b> the wealthy men of Tekoa. <b> did not bring their neck</b>  They did not assist in the service of the Holy  One, blessed be He, to build the wall of the city.  <b> 6</b>  <b> And...the gate of the old [city]</b>  Heb.  הישנה , the Gate Yeshana, such was its name.  <b> 7</b>  <b> a throne for the governor of the land beyond the river</b>  The [people of] the land beyond the river  built a throne for the governor of the land beyond the river to sit upon.  <b> 8</b>  <b> goldsmiths</b>  That family was called by their craft. <b> and they filled Jerusalem</b>  Heb.  ויעזבו ירושלים  They filled it with earth up to the wide wall in order to strengthen it.  <b> 9</b>  <b> the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem</b>  He was the prince over half the people in Jerusalem.  פלך  is an expression of a duchy or a kingdom.  <b> 10</b>  <b> and opposite his house</b>  his lot fell to build, for his house was near that place of the wall of the city.  <b> 11</b>  <b> a second measure</b>  Just like the measurement which his friend built before [him], so he also built  like [his friend.] <b> a second measure</b>  in the building of the wall. The expression of measure is  inappropriate for the building of the gates because they have [a measure] only in the building of a part  of the wall, for we do not find in the entire chapter of the building of the gates the expression of a  measure. <b> the Tower of the Furnaces</b>  He also built a tower by that name. All these towers in the  chapter were built in the wall around the city.  <b> 12</b>  <b> he and his daughters</b>  Shallum and his daughters repaired the building of the structure.  <b> 13</b>  <b> until the Dung Gate</b>  but the Dung Gate was not included.  <b> 15</b>  <b> the ruler of the district of Mizpah</b>  the prince and duke of Mizpah. <b> he built it</b>  he was building the  same gate. <b> and roofed it</b>  And he laid the roof on it, an expression of a ceiling  (מטללתא) . <b> of the pool of Shelah</b>  which inclines towards the kings garden. <b> and until the steps</b>  They recognized  these places.  <b> 16</b>  <b> Beth Zur</b>  the name of a place.  <b> 17</b>  <b> half the district</b>  From that bailiwick, the half district, he built this structure. In the word  לפלכו ,  the kaff has a dagesh, as one says from  מלך ,  מלכו , from  עבד ,  עבדו , so does one say from  פלך ,  פלכו , for [if] the last letter of the noun is one of the  letters beth, gimmel, daleth, kaff, pey, or tav, it is punctuated with a dagesh.  <b> 18</b>  <b> their brothers</b>  the Levites.  <b> 19</b>  <b> opposite the ascent to the armory</b>  opposite the place where the mighty men would ascend to the  weapons. According to the simple interpretation of the verse, it appears that there was a place near the  wall where the mighty men kept their weapons, as it is stated: (II Kings 10:2) ...and cities (sic) of  fortification and arms. <b> at the corner</b>  at the corner of the wall.  <b> 20</b>  <b> repaired</b>  Heb.  החרה . Its interpretation is according to the context, and it is a double expression for  repairing.  <b> 21</b>  <b> from the entrance of the house of Eliashib until the end of, etc.</b>  Opposite that house he built his  structure.  <b> 23</b>  <b> opposite their house</b>  which was there near the wall.  <b> 25</b>  <b> and the tower that juts out</b>  There was one tower in the wall that jutted out and protruded from  within.  <b> 26</b>  <b> And the Nethinites dwelt in the Ophel</b>  And the Nethinites were dwelling in that district, and they  were building their district, which was near the wall, until opposite the Water Gate of the eastern side. <b> and the tower that juts out</b>  There was a tower in the wall that jutted out and protruded from within.  <b> 28</b>  <b> each one opposite his house</b>  Each one was building opposite his house.  <b> 30</b>  <b> and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph</b>  Zalaph had many sons, and Hanun was the sixth. <b> measure</b>  Heb.  מדה שני , like  שנית . <b> his chamber</b>  Heb.  נשכתו , like  לשכתו . He had one chamber adjoining  the wall.  <b> 31</b>  <b> the son of Hatzorefi</b>  the goldsmith, and he was named after his craft.  <b> 32</b>  <b> And between the ascent to the tower and the Sheep Gate</b>  At the beginning of the building they  began to build the Sheep Gate, as it says (verse 1): ...and they built the Sheep Gate, etc. So did they  build the wall all around, one after the other.  <b> 34</b>  <b> before his brethren and the army of Samaria</b>  before his brethren and the army of Samaria, who  were the adversaries of Judea. <b> What are the Jews</b>  Why are the Jews doing this? <b> the feeble</b>  Heb.  האמללים , a term denoting weakness and feebleness. <b> Will they let them</b>  Do they think that the  heathens will allow them to build? <b> Will they sacrifice</b>  Will they constantly slaughter their sacrifices  for themselves as they think? <b> Will they finish in one day</b>  Will they complete the work that they  started in one day? That is to say that the heathens will not permit them to complete their building. <b> Will they revive</b>  Will they revive and repair and restore stones to their previous state to be harder and  stronger than the dust? <b> from the heaps</b>  Heb.  מערמות , a term denoting heaps and mounds. <b> burnt</b>  The stones were burnt and have become dust. So did they jeer and ridicule the building of the  wall, which they were building from the burnt stones that had fallen to the earth from the fire when  Jerusalem was burned.  <b> 35</b>  <b> And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him</b>  Tobiah was beside Sanballat. <b> and he said</b>  And so he  was saying and ridiculing. <b> Even what they build</b>  even this building that they are building. <b> comes up</b>  on the building to breach the wall of the city, what will become of it? That is to say that the  building cannot be repaired, and whoever wishes, can come and break into it.  <b> 36</b>  <b> Hearken, our God</b>  When I heard their ridicule of us, I prayed this prayer. <b> in a land of captivity </b> that they be exiled from the land as we were exiled.  <b> 37</b>  <b> And do not conceal</b>  Heb.  ואל תכס , like  ואל תכסה , similar to (Prov. 25:9): ...but do not divulge  (תגל)  anothers secret, like  תגלה . <b> for they have provoked</b>  that they have provoked the builders  to ridicule them.  <b> 38</b>  <b> was built</b>  Heb.  ותקשר , lit. it was bound. When the wall was bound up and built to its half, the  people were eager and anxious to complete their building of it.   <b> Chapter 4</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> was repaired</b>  Heb.  עלתה ארוכה , [lit. attained a cure,] that the wall was built. <b> repaired</b>  A [word  having the] meaning of bandaging and healing. <b> to be closed in</b>  that the people of the city, who had heretofore been exposed without a wall, were now  closed in by the building of the wall.  <b> 2</b>  <b> and to wreak destruction therein</b>  to wreak upon the building of the wall ruin and destruction. It is  like (Isa. 32:5): ...and to speak destructively  (תועה)  about the Lord.  <b> 3</b>  <b> over them</b>  over the builders. <b> because of them</b>  because of the enemies.  <b> 4</b>  <b> And Judea said</b>  So were the people of Judea saying and complaining. <b> failed</b>  Those who bear and load the stones and the wood for the building of the wall have failed in  their strength, for they have no more strength to build because of the enemies. <b> earth</b>  There is still much mud and clay to place into the wall, meaning that we still have much work,  but we cannot build because of fear of the enemies.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And our adversaries said</b>  Nehemiah proceeds to tell this. <b> see</b>  So were our adversaries saying about us: They will not know, and the Israelites will not recognize  us until we come suddenly into their midst and kill them, and with this plot we will stop and curtail the  building.  <b> 6</b>  <b> Now it came to pass when the Jews came</b>  And now, the adversaries who had conspired together to  wage war against us gathered with the Jews who were among them in their lands, and those Jews who  had joined them came before the army, as is customary for soldiers to do, to speak to us, and in this  manner the Jews conspired against the enemies. Now it came to pass when the Jews who dwelt beside  them came, etc. <b> that they said to us ten times</b>  Those Jews warned us as many as ten times to wage  war against our enemies because they were coming to war. And this is what they said to us, From all  the places, etc. From all those places where you will be scattered while building the wall, here and  there, be careful to assemble until you return upon us together to wage war against us.  <b> 7</b>  <b> So I stationed from below...the wall</b>  When I heard their words, I stationed [mighty men] from  below that place around Jerusalem, from behind the wall of the city and on the bare rocks. <b> to families</b>  of the people, of the mighty men among them with their weapons, to fight against our  enemies when they would come. <b> And I stationed from below, etc. and I stationed the people, etc. </b> This verse follows the pattern of (Exod. 4:9): ...and the water that you will take from the river will  be...will become blood on the dry land; (Ps. 92:10): For behold, Your enemies, O Lord, for behold,  Your enemies shall perish; (Jud. 5:12): Praise! Praise! Deborah. Praise! Praise! Utter a song; (Ps.  115:1): Not to us, O Lord, not to us.  <b> 8</b>  <b> And I saw, and I arose</b>  And when I saw the enemies coming, I arose to speak to the nobles and to  the prefects to spur them to fight against our enemy. <b> for your brethren</b>  Heb.  על אחיכם , for the sake of  your brethren.  <b> 9</b>  <b> that it had become known to us</b>  that they were coming to fight against us. <b> and we all returned</b>  We  all returned from the place where we had gathered to meet the enemies, each one to his work in the  building of the wall.  <b> 10</b>  <b> And it was from that day on</b>  And from that day on, half the mighty men worked at the building of  the wall, and the remaining half of the mighty men were armed with weapons to guard their brethren  who were doing the work. <b> spears</b>  Heb.  והרמחים . The vav is superfluous, like the vav of (Gen. 36:  24): And these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah  (ואיה)  and Anah. <b> and the rulers</b>  were close behind the  entire tribe of Judah to be cautious in the battle.  <b> 11</b>  <b> The builders of the wall, etc.</b>  Those who were building the wall and those who were loading and  carrying the loads were working with one hand, and carrying weapons with the other. <b> the sword</b>  Heb.  השלח , an implement of war, like (Job 33:18): ...from perishing by the sword  (מעבר בשלח) . And so did  Menahem associate it (Machbereth Menahem p. 174).  <b> 12</b>  <b> And the builders</b>  How were they building? They were all girded, each one with his sword on his  waist, and thus did they build. <b> beside me</b>  He was always beside me.  <b> 13</b>  <b> much</b>  Heb.  הרבה , a great [amount of work].  <b> 14</b>  <b> will fight for us</b>  [as translated,] will fight for us.  <b> 16</b>  <b> Let each man and his youth</b>  each of the builders and a youth with him. <b> Jerusalem</b>  And the night was for their watch, and [during] the day they were doing work. The result  was that they did not sleep at all.  <b> 17</b>  <b> we did not take off our clothes</b>  We were always zealous in guarding. <b> water</b>  This refers back to not above, like (I Sam. 2:3): ...let not arrogance come out of your  mouth. None of us would take off his clothes to lie down or to wash them with water, and this is a  double expression, [repeating,] we did not undress. <b> took it off</b>  Heb.  שלחו , taking off, like (Lev. 6:  4): He shall then take off his garments, which is translated by Targum as  וישלח .   <b> Chapter 5</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> Now the cry of the people and their wives was great</b>  The poor people were crying exceedingly. <b> about their brothers, the Jews</b>  about their brothers, the rich Jews.  <b> 2</b>  <b> There were some who were saying</b>  He gives a reason for his words: Why were they crying? Some  of the poor people were saying, We are many with our sons and daughters and have to buy corn.  Now we will have to sell our sons and daughters in order to buy corn in order to live. So were they  crying about the rich Jews who did not wish to support them.  <b> 3</b>  <b> And there were some who were saying Our fields, etc.</b>  And there were some among the poor  who were complaining and saying Our fields, vineyards and houses we shall give to others as a pledge  and as security to buy corn for our food. <b> for the hunger</b>  since the rich do not give any of their  property up to us for our support.  <b> 4</b>  <b> And there were some who were saying, We have borrowed money</b>  And there were some who  were saying, We have already borrowed money from others on our fields and our vineyards to pay  the kings tax, and now we have nothing for our support. <b> for the kings tax</b>  Heb.  למדת , for the kings  tax, like (Ezra 4:13): ...the kings due  (מנדה) , the head tax, and the meal tax.  <b> 5</b>  <b> And now, like the flesh of our brethren is our flesh</b>  And now, we are as esteemed and  distinguished as our brethren who are rich. <b> like their children are our children</b>  Like their children,  who are esteemed and distinguished, so are our children distinguished. <b> and behold, we are subjecting </b> And now we have to subject and deliver our sons and daughters to others for the sake of our  sustenance. <b> and some of our daughters are subjected</b>  And already there are some of our daughters  who are subjected to others in slavery. <b> and we have no power</b>  We do not have the ability to redeem  them. <b> and others have our fields and vineyards</b>  We have even delivered our fields and vineyards to  others for our sustenance. From now on, what shall we eat?

service, and all of Israel brought them their gifts there.  <b> 13</b>  <b> for they were deemed trustworthy</b>  to distribute the gifts among them [the Levites].  <b> 15</b>  <b> the stacks</b>
