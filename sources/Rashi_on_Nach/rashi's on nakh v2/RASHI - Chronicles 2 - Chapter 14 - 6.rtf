\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ them, they will be a refuge for us. And all this happened in the ten years about which it is written 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (above 13:23): “in his time the land was tranquil.” But after those ten years, there was a war between 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ him and Baasha all their lives, for in the third year of Asa, Baasha reigned, and seven years there was 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ peace between them, and so it is proven here as well (verse 5): “and there was no war with him in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ these years.” But in the other years there was war with him, and below (15:19) it is written: “And 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.” We can, however, explain that the war that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he had with the Cushites was not until the thirty-fifth year of his reign, but this is difficult to me, for it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is written below (16:1): “In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha...advanced,” until (verse 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 9): “you have dealt foolishly concerning this, for from now on there will be wars with you.” It appears 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from here that prior to this, he did not have wars, and he lived after that only five years, and in I Kings 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 15:32, it is written: “And there was war between Asa and Baasha, etc. all their lives.” In \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Seder Olam 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ch. 16) it is explained clearly. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ for we sought the Lord our God; we sought [Him]\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Since we sought 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Him, He gave us peace from round about. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ So they built\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  cities. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and prospered\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  And a similar instance 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is (above 12:7): “And when the Lord saw that they had humbled themselves, etc.”
