\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Thus is this taught in the Tractate Midos (4:3), “One was to the chamber on the right and one was to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the chamber on the left and one to the chamber above.” And the prophet teaches us here that [only] 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ one of the lower [chambers] on the southern side had an opening to the outside and [only] through that

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ chambers on the southern side which had an opening to the outside in the lowest story. And this is the
