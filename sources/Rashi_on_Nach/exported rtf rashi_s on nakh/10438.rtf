Some explain that this was

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ because it is written (II Kings 16:15): “and the burnt offerings of the entire people of the land, etc. and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the blood of every burnt offering, etc. shall be for me to visit,” i.e., the copper altar, which was there 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ heretofore, shall be for me to visit. This proves that Moses’ copper altar was still there.
