\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ find, when they went out to Rabshakeh, and he revealed to him Shebna and his company, and they 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ dragged him with their horses’ tails, as is related in San. (26b). When Sennacherib went to Tirhakah, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ king of Cush, he swept away Shebna and his company and went away. We learned this in Seder Olam 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ch. 23).
