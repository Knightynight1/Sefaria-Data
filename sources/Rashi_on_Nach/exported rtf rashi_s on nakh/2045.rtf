\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ destined to come upon them, viz. Uriah the priest, whom Jehoiakim dispatched, as it is said (Jer. 26: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 20): “And also a man was prophesying in the name of the Lord, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Kiriath-jearim, and he prophesied concerning this city and concerning this land, according to all the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ words of Jeremiah.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  who prophesied in the second year of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Darius (Zech. 8:4): “Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem.” Uriah is a sign 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for Zechariah. If you see that Uriah’s prophecy is fulfilled, you can expect that Zechariah’s will 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ likewise be fulfilled, just as I have called to testify concerning Sennacherib, Amos and Isaiah; Amos 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for the calamity of the ten tribes (Amos 7:11): “And Israel shall surely be exiled,” and Isaiah for his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ promise to Hezekiah (Isaiah 32,33) [when he would reign].
