\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to Abarbanel: I found a Midrash Tanhuma, where it is an expression of tying, like a man who threatens 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ a person who provokes him, ì[I swear] by your life that I will tie it to you at your end.î So does this 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ verse threaten Israel: ìMy zeal and My fury are tied up to avenge Myself at the end, and they will be 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ashamed of their deeds.î
