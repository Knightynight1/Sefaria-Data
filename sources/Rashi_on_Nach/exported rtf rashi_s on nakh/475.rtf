\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ eleven hundred pieces of silver (as above 16:5), but they are mistaken because Micah preceded 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Samson many years. However, these sections are adjacent because of the wicked silver which was an 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ equal amount in both of them, and by their both being silver of misfortune.
