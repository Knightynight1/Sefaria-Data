\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and the priests passed over in the presence of the people etc. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ that they come up out of the Jordan 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that they cross, is not written here, but “that they come up.” Hence, we deduce that they came up on 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the bank beside which they were standing. And it is impossible to say that they were standing beside 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the western bank of the Jordan, for it is stated above: The feet of the priests were dipped in the edge of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the water. And there it is stated: And the priests stood and all Israel passed.
