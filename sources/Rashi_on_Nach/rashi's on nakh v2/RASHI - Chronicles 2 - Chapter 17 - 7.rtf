Others explain: he sent to his officers, every officer a valiant man. But 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ I have difficulty with this interpretation because, if so, it should have only said, “Obadiah.” The fact 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that it says, “to Obadiah” proves that Ben Hail was a person’s name. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ to teach in the cities of Judah 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [i.e., to teach] the Torah and to instruct the Children of Israel.
