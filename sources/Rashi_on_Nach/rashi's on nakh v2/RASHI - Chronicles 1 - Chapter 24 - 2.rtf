\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ preceded Eleazar and Ithamar in the high priesthood, for so we find with Ezra (3:9), for Jehozadak was 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Joshua’s father, and Jehozadak and Ezra were the sons of Seraiah, as it is written: (above 5:41): “... 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and Seraiah begot Jehozadak.” And in Ezra (7:1), it is written: “Ezra the son of Seraiah.” And 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Jehozadak went into exile to Babylon, and when they came up from Babylon, Joshua went up and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ served, but Ezra did not serve because Jehozadak was the firstborn, and the son of his firstborn brother 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ preceded him, as is written in the prophecy of Haggai (1:1): “Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the High 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Priest.”
