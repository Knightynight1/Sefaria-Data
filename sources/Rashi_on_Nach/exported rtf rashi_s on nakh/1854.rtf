\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ awoke after nine hours and found that it was morning. He sought to kill his servants. He said, “You let 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ me sleep a day and a night.” They replied, “The sphere of the sun went back.” He said to them, “Who 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ brought it back?” They said to him, “The God of Hezekiah.” As is stated in Pesikta (d’Rav Kahana p. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 14a).
