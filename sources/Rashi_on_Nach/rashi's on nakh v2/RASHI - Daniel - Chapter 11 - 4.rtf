\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ height of his strength, his kingdom will be broken, meaning that he will die. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and it will be divided to

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ kingdom between the four heads of his family; they are the four heads of the leopard that Daniel saw 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (above 7:6): ìAnd behold another one, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird on its back, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the beast had four heads.î He gave this one dominion in the east, this one in the west, this one in the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ north and this one in the south, and so in the first vision (8:8): ìan appearance of four sprouted in its 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ stead,î concerning the horns of the he-goat. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ but not to his posterity\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  The dominion will not come to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ his sons but to his family members. [The word] \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ‡«Á¬¯ƒÈ˙Â…\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  coincides only with the expression of sons, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ so Scripture states (Amos 4:2): ìand you shall be borne on shields and your posterity \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (‡«Á¬¯ƒÈ˙¿Î∆Ô)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  in fishing 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ boats,î which Jonathan renders: and your sons (sic) and daughters in fishermenís boats. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and not like 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ the dominion that he ruled\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  but the kingdom of these will not be as strong as that of Alexander. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ his kingdom will be uprooted\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  to divide to these four heads and to others besides these.
