\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ during the eighteen years from the name that Zerubbabel and Joshua the Priest came to Jerusalem in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the days of Cyrus I until Cyrus the son of Esther came. All of this [book] is for the [purpose of tracing 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the] lineage of King David and the Levites for gate sentries, guards, and singers, how David stationed 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ them in their positions, and the priests in their watches. Therefore, he traced their lineage from Adam 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to Abraham, and since he had to trace Abraham’s lineage, he mentioned also the rest of the nations, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ his sons and his grandsons, and because of his sons, he had to trace the lineage of the rest of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ nations, the sons of Canaan, to let [us] know how Abraham inherited their land. And since he had to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ mention and trace the lineage of the generations of Canaan, he mentioned together with them (the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ generations of) the rest of the nations, but he mentions them only briefly and casts them away until he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ reaches the main ones, as is explained in \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Genesis Rabbah\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  (39:10) (See also \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Tanhuma Veyesheb\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  1). This can 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ be compared to a king who was traveling from place to place and dropped a pearl. The king stood and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sifted the sand with a sieve until he found the pearl. So said the Holy One, blessed be He, “Why 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ should I trace the lineage of Shem and Arpachshad and Terach except to find Abraham?” [As it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ written] (Neh. 9:8): “... and You found his heart faithful [before You].” And because of the honor of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Isaac, he traced the lineage of the sons of Esau and Ishmael and the sons of Keturah, and he cast them 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ away little by little and left them. He mentions the sons of Seir because the sons of Esau inherited 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ them [i.e., their territory]; he also traces the lineage of Timna, who became a concubine to the seed of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Abraham, to let us know the praise of Abraham, for she was the daughter of princes and chiefs and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wished to be a concubine to the seed of Abraham, as it is written (Gen. 36:22): “... and Lotan’s sister 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ was Timna,” and it is written (ibid. 12): “And Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz the son of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Esau,” because she said, “If I am not worthy to marry him, I shall be his concubine.” (\lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Gen. Rabbah\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  84: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 14, \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Sanh.\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  99b) Moreover, for this reason, he traced the lineage of the sons of Seir because they were 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ chiefs and princes, and Mount Seir belonged to Seir, but out of love for Isaac, the Holy One, blessed 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ be He, gave it to Esau, as it is written (Deut. 2:12): “... and the children of Esau drove them out, etc., 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and settled in their place,” and to inform us of the fulfillment of the words of the Holy One, blessed be 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ He, Who promised Isaac that He would multiply his seed and give him dominion over all, and because 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of the honor of Isaac he likewise wrote (verse. 31): “Now these are the kings who reigned in the land 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of Edom, etc.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ Adam, Seth, Enosh\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  This is to be interpreted like: “The sons of Adam: Seth, and the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sons of Seth: Enosh,” but since they were not the main part of the genealogy, he states them briefly, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and he does not mention Cain and Abel because they did not beget generations, but from Seth 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ emerged the generations of Noah and Abraham, and from Abraham to David.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Judg. 12:8): “And after him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.” About this I am amazed, for we find 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ concerning Abram, that he said, “After his blood had become clotted, etc.,” and he said, (Gen. 17:

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the age of three hundred? It is possible to say that for this reason Scripture says (Ruth 4:13): “... and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the Lord gave her conception,” on the pattern of “... and the Lord blessed him.” (Ibzan - The father of

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ were already born, for the Tabernacle that Bezalel made had been erected. Caleb was eight years old

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ was eight years old when he begot Uri, and Uri was eight years old when he begot Bezalel, thus 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ making 26 years, and it is written (Exod. 36:1): “and every wise hearted man,” and a man is not less 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ than thirteen years old. So Bezalel was thirteen years old when he made the Tabernacle. Thus, we

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ children, and so it is explained in Chapter “ \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Ben sorer umoreh\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  ” (\lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Sanh.\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  69a).

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ generation (Ps. 6:1f.): “O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger,” and because of his prayer, the sons

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and Judah’s territory was too large for them, Judah accepted Simeon in its territory, because Simeon 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ had no share in the land of Israel, as it says (Gen. 49:7): “I shall divide them in Jacob and scatter them 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ in Israel,” and we learned in \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Genesis Rabbah\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  (\lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Shittah Hadashah\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ): “I shall divide them among the Children 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of Israel to station scribes in Israel in the synagogues, etc.” Now how do we know that they agreed [to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ give them a share of their territory]? For it is written (Jos. 19:9): “Out of the lot of the children of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon, for the portion of the children of Judah was too 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ large for them; therefore the children of Simeon inherited in the midst of their inheritance,” lest the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ beasts of the field outnumber them. Now as regards the verse (ibid. v. 1): “And the second lot came 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ out to Simeon,” this is what happened: They cast lots to choose which tribe would accept Simeon in its 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ territory, and the lot fell upon the territory of Judah. And the meaning of the verse (Jud. 1:3): “And 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Judah said to Simeon his brother: Come up with me into my lot, and we will fight against the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Canaanites, and I will also go with you into your lot,” refers to “the lot I have given you.”

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ were eight priests. Accordingly, they emended in \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Yoma\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  in the first chapter (9a), and in \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Leviticus Rabbah 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (21:9), and in \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Siphre\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ parashath Phineas\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  (Num. 25:12), that eight high priests served in the First Temple. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Some say that there were eighteen. But neither one is a viable theory because Zadok was the first who 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ministered in the time of Solomon. Moreover, which Amariah was in the days of Jehoshaphat, about 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ whom it is written (II Chron 19:11): “... and behold, Amariah the head priest”? Now he was Amariah 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the son of Azariah, who lived in the days of Uzziah and in the days of Hezekiah, who was after 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Jehoshaphat. If you say [that it was] Azariah the father of Seraiah, then where was Hilkiah the High 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Priest who lived in the days of Josiah? Rather we must count from Zadok, and there were twelve 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ priests from Zadok until Seraiah, and so we find in an exact version of \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Leviticus Rabbah\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ . Now that which 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the Scripture writes: “... he was the one who served in the Temple,” is explained in \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Sefer Yerushalmi 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (source unknown. Perhaps \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Sifre Zuta, Korah\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  18:7 is meant) as follows: Did he alone serve, and did he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ serve in the days of Solomon? Did not other priests serve as well? But because he risked his life for the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sanctity of the Temple by not allowing Uzziah to burn incense, it is said: “he was the one who served 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ in the Temple that Solomon built,” and he was the Azariah who lived in the days of Uzziah (ibid. 26: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 17, 20) and in the days of Hezekiah, and Azariah the son of Ahimaaz was Amariah the priest who 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ served in the days of Jehoshaphat, just as Uzziah is called Azariah, as is written (II Ki. 15:1): “In the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam etc, Azariah... became king.” And Azariah the son of Ahimaaz was 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ called Zechariah, as it is written (II Chron. 26:5): “And he was wont to seek God in the days of

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ever served in the high priesthood, for he was exiled to Babylon in the days of Jeconiah, as it is

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ascended from Babylon during the time of the Second Temple. Now why was Azariah the son of

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is the reason: because Joshua ascended with Zerubbabel many days and years before Ezra ascended.

This is the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ reason, as explained at the end of \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Megillah Yerushalmi\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 0 (see Com. Dig. 8:29): Ezra found three books, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and each one of them contained part of the genealogy; that which he found he did not write, and of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sons of Naphtali he did not find any more. For this reason, the entire genealogy is traced with 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ omissions, because he skipped from one book to another and combined them. And that which he could 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ not write in this Book, he wrote in the Book of Ezra. You should know [that this is true] because it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ written close by (9:1): “And all Israel traced their genealogy, and behold they are written in the book 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of the kings of Israel, and Judah was exiled to Babylon because of its treachery.” The meaning is that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ if you wish to know the genealogy of the Ten Tribes, go to Halah and Habor, the Gozan River, and the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ cities of Media, because their annals were exiled with them, but as for Judah I found their records in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Babylon, and that which I found, I wrote.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ accepted the words of the two. Likewise, they found many genealogical records. When they found 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ three or five, they rejected the minority and accepted the majority. When they found an even number, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ e.g. “And in Gibeon dwelt the leader of Gibeon,” he had to write it twice because the order of their 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ genealogy is not uniform, and likewise, [in] “the first settlers,” he found an even number, which 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ differed one from the other. [Therefore], it was written twice: here and in his [Ezra’s] book. Now why 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ did he not write both of them here, including those that are in Ezra: "And these are the heads of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ province, etc."? Because he traced the genealogy there until, “And these are the priests and the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Levites,” and he traced the genealogy here until Jedaiah, who was after Ezra. Now what purpose 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ would it have to explain and to trace the genealogy here in Chronicles, the generations and the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ genealogy after Ezra, except for those who were alive during the First Temple period?

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ not have been so large, but from God the camp was so large, because they came to him by the counsel

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ not a conclusion of the Psalm (96) but [a continuation] of Psalm (105): “Give thanks to the Lord, call 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ out in His Name.” The verse (35): “And say, save us, etc.” is from the Psalm (106). And this Psalm 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (106) commences with this verse (in Chron.). Now is it appropriate here, “And say, etc. and save us 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from the nations,” for when were they exiled in David’s time, that he should say, "and save us from 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ among the nations"? And this is the arrangement in Psalms. Psalm (105) commences: “Give thanks to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the Lord, call out in His name,” and it concludes only with “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ etc.” until “Amen! Hallelujah,” for it is all one topic, but because it is a long psalm, it was divided, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ it commences, "Give thanks to the Lord for He is good.” Similarly, Job, when he had to lengthen his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ reply, he shortened it and divided it in two, and it says, (Job 29:1): “And Job again took up his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ parable,” for in song, because of his ecstasies of joy, he could not speak at length; so he divided it in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ two. And so, in the matter of lamentation, because of his intense pain he could not speak at length, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he divided it in two, because both song and lamentation are uttered similarly. When Hannah came to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ pray in the forecourt, Eli thought her to be a drunken woman, because he thought that she acted in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that manner because of wine, but she said, (I Sam. 1:15f.): “... and neither new wine nor old wine have 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ I drunk, etc., for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation....” From here we learn that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ drunken people and those suffering from pain behave in the same manner.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 46): “And He caused them to be pitied by their captors.” Now, it is appropriate to say, “Save us, O 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Lord our God, and gather us from the nations,” as You have done to them. In Psalms, it does not 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ say, “And say, save us” but only, “Save us,” because that is the appropriate wording. For the following 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ reason, David recited these two psalms when he brought the Ark: It is explained in Genesis Rabbah 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (54:4): “since the cows, when they sang, recited these two psalms.” Rabbi Samuel the son of Nahmani 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ said: (I Sam. 6:12): ‘And the cows sang.’ What song did they sing? ‘Give thanks to the Lord, call out in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ His name.’ Rabbi Eleazar says: ‘Sing to the Lord, all the earth, etc.’ " Therefore, David instituted them 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to recite them before the Ark, one psalm in the morning and one psalm in the evening. Quoted from 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Rabbi Eleazar the son of Meshullam of blessed memory.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ this entire Book, he is called Abshai, and in the entire Book of Samuel he is called Abishai, except 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ once, where he is called Abshai: (II Sam. 10:10): “And the rest of the people he gave over to Abshai 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ his brother.” This is according to the Masorah, because Jesse was the father of his mother, Zeruiah, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ who was his mother.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ believe that Goliath the Gittite is not identical with Goliath the Philistine. One reason is that there [I 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Sam. 17:23] he called him Goliath the Philistine. Another reason is that above it is written: “... then 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Sibbecai the Hushathite smote Sippai of the sons of Rapha,” and also below it is written: “and he too 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ was born to Raphah.” Since he does not mention that Goliath the Gittite was a son of Rapha, it proves 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that he [Goliath the Gittite] was not her son

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ written: “eight hundred thousand, etc., and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men,” which 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ apparently means that there were not so many of Israel as are stated here. The truth is that because the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ anger of the Holy One, blessed be He, was upon David, Scripture did not write there the number of all 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of those whom he had counted. Neither did Joab count all the tribes, as it is written (verse 6): “... 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ because the word of the king was repugnant to Joab.” But here, because of David’s honor, he does 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ mention the number and the reckoning that he counted, because it is his honor that such a massive 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ army was in his tribe. And the following is proof to what I explained: that even that small part of Israel 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that he counted, he did not write their entire number in Samuel, but here, [the Chronicler] did write the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ entire number that he counted, because it is written here: “and all Israel were,” whereas in Samuel it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ not written: “all.” And it is explicitly proven here before us, as it is written: (below 27:24): "Joab the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ son of Zeruiah began to count but did not finish, and with this there was anger upon Israel, and the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ number did not reach the number of the chronicles of King David."

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ in the section entitled: (Lev. 12:2): "If a woman conceives seed: Even if one be the most pious of the

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for his own pleasure." The third is (Prov. 5:22): “His iniquities \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (òÂååÉðåÉúÈéå)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  shall trap the wicked

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ flesh and blood king gives a position or a ruling power in the kingdom to one of his servants after the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ prince, he is his servant wherever he is, but the kingdom does not belong to the king, and the one to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ whom the kingdom belongs does not have the servant, but as for the Holy One, blessed be He - the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ servant appointed to rule is His, and also the kingdom is His (\lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ cotre\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  in Old French, kingdom) and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ therefore, it is written: “Yours is the kingdom, and You are He Who is exalted ” over them, for even 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the superintendent of the well is appointed from heaven (\lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Baba Bathra\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  91b). They explained further: “... 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and [You are He] Who is exalted over everything at the beginning.” When we think that we have 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ praised You with all the thanksgivings, and You have no more praise, it is still nothing, for the praised 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ One stands at the beginning of the praises. And so when David concludes all his praises in Psalms, he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ commences with the final psalm (149:1): “Sing to the Lord a new song,” i.e., all the praises are new, as 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ though we had never praised Him. In this manner Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Meir the son of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Rabbi Isaac of Orleans explained, and it seems to me that it is so in Hagigah Yerushalmi.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ on the throne of the Lord because the throne is God’s to enthrone upon it whomever He wishes, and in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the Midrash (\lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Peskikta d’Rav Kahana\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  p. 53a) it is explained that the throne was full (at its highest level) 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ like the moon on the fifteenth of the month, because from Abraham to Solomon were fifteen 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ generations: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmah, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David, and Solomon, and that is what is written: (Ps. 89:37): “...and his throne is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ like the sun before Me,” which never diminishes, and if you wish to compare it to the moon, it will be 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ like the moon which will be established in the time to come. But from Solomon and onward, the kings 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ diminished from their greatness like the moon, which continuously diminishes, until Zedekiah, (II 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Kings 25:7): “...and he blinded Zedekiah’ s eyes.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and all Israel obeyed him\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  immediately, unlike 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Saul, about whom it is written: (I Sam. 10:27): “And wicked men said: How will this one save 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ us?” And also David ruled at first only in Hebron for seven years.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 20:22): “And at the time they began with song and praise, the Lord stationed, etc.,” and so with
