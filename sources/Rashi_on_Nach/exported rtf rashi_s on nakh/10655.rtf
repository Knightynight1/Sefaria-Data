\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Levites should play musical instruments. It is not written in the Torah that a sacrifice requires musical 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ accompaniment (lit., song), but it is the commandment of the Lord, which He commanded through His 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ prophets to accompany the sacrifice with song. Our Rabbis explained in Tractate \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Arachin\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  (11a): From 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ where do we derive that the Levites are required to play musical instruments? For it is written (Num. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 4:47): ìthe service of the service.î Which is a service that requires another service with it? This is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ music with a musical instrument. ìAnd the service of raisingî may also be correctly explained in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ reference to song, as it is written (I Chron. 15:22): ìAnd Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites in song
