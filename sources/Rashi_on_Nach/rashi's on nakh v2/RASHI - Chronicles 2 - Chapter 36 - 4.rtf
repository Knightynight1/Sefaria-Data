\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ upon their servants as they wish. An example is (Gen. 41:45): “And Pharaoh named Joseph, etc.,” and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ so (Num. 13:16): “and Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua,” and so, (Dan. 1:7): “Now the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ chief officer gave them names, etc.” All this is to make known that he rules over him to name him as 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he desires. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and he changed his name to Jehoiakim\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Why did he change his name to Jehoiakim? It is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ explained above that after Pharaoh slew Josiah, he appointed a king and fined them by imposing a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ tribute of enslavement upon them.
