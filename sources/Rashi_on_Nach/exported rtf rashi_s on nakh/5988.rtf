\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of the beasts. When the beasts are thirsty for water, they gather to her so that she should raise her eyes 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to heaven. And what does she do? She digs a pit and thrusts her antlers into it and lows. Thereupon, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the Holy One, blessed be He, has compassion on her and the deep brings up water for her. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ As a hart

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ masculine].” Only, “As a hart cries longingly.” Scripture speaks of [both] a male and a female. The 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ male cries longingly for water, as we explained, and the female when she kneels to give birth, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [because] her womb is narrow. [When] she cries out, the Holy One, blessed be He, is compassionate 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and prepares a serpent, which bites her on her birth canal, whereupon her womb opens. Menachem (p. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 138) connects \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ תערג\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  with (Song 5:13): “His cheeks are like a bed of \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (כערוגת)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  spice,” but his view is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ impossible. Dunash (p. 18) too explained it as the sound of the hart.
