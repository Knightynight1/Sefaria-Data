It is not stated, (Ps. 118:16) “The right 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ hand of the Lord is exalted; the right hand of the Lord does valiantly”; (Ex. 15:6) “Your right hand, O 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Lord, is mighty with power; Your right hand, O Lord, dashes the foe”? But rather, the passage means 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that these would stand on the right and these would stand on the left. Those who stand on the right 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ present the case for the defense and those who stand on the left present the case for the prosecution.
