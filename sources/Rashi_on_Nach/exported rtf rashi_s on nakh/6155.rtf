This is an expression of truth. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ Is it true that you were silent about the

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ when he entered the barricade where Saul was lying, took the spear and the jug, went away, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ called, “Will you not answer, Abner?” (I Sam. 26:14). That is to say, “Shouldn’t you now prove to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Saul and show him that he pursues me for no reason? For had I wished, I would have killed him.” And 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ so did he say in his song: Is it true that the righteousness that you should have said and the equities 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ with which you should have judged have been silenced from your mouth? The righteousness that you 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ should have spoken.
