Like (Isa. 25:11): ìAnd he shall spread out \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ÂÃÙ≈¯«˘Ã“)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  his

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ them. Another explanation is: Zion broke, an expression of breaking, like (Lam. 4:4): ìno one breaks it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for themî; (Jer. 16:7): ìand they shall not break [bread] \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ÈƒÙ¿¯¿ÒÂÃ)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  for them in mourning,î to console 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ him for his dead [kinsman]. So did Menachem classify it (Machbereth Menachem p. 146). And in the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ language of the Mishnah (Ber. 37a), the broken piece of bread \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ÙÃ¿¯ÂÃÒ»‰)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  is intact. And it means that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Zion was in pain like a person who clasps his hands and breaks them. I found an addendum. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ the Lord

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ concerning Jacob that his adversaries would surround him. Even when they were exiled to Babylon 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and to Assyria, Sennacherib exiled their enemies, Ammon and Moab, and settled them beside them, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and they taunted them, as is stated in Tractate Kiddushin (72a): Humania was in Babylon, entirely 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ occupied by Ammonites. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ an outcast\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Heb. \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Ï¿ƒ„»‰\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , for an outcast and a disgrace.
