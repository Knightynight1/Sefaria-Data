\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and Shimshai was the scribe\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  And Shimshai was the scribe: he is Shimshai the son of Haman. So it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ customary to mention the scribe and the secretary together because they need each other; one 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ composes and dictates, and the scribe writes, as it says (I Kings 4:3): ìEliphoreph and Ahiah, the sons 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of Shisha, scribes, Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahlud, the secretary,î and in another place it says (Isa. 36: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 22): ìAnd Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah etc. and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is similar to the expression of the Gemara: ìas we wish to say further.î
