\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the passive voice and the active voice. Had the prophet written \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ğÀùÇãÉğåÌ\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , in the passive voice, the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ expression would refer to the robbed and not to the robbers. Had he written \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ùÇãåÌğåÌ\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , in the active voice, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the expression would refer to the robbers and not to the robbed. This way, it refers to both: we were 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ given into the hand of those who robbed us. In Old French, there is the expression \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ somes degatert nous\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ we were ravaged. Another explanation: \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ğÀùÑÇãÌËğåÌ\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  means we brought upon ourselves that they robbed us.
