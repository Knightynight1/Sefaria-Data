\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ stench.” When the Shechinah was still at Sinai, I sinned with the Calf; Scripture describes it with an 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ expression of love, “gave forth its fragrance,” and did not write, “stank,” or “became putrid,” because 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Scripture speaks euphemistically. [Rashi from Shab. 88b] (According to the Tosafists, it does not 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ say, “stank,” because of euphemism, and it does not say, “abandoned its fragrance,” because of love.)
