\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 1): “These are the words that Moses spoke”... (ibid. 32:15): “And Jeshurun became fat.” (Amos 1: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 1): “The words of Amos”... (ibid. 4:1): “Hearken to this word, O cows of Bashan.” (Jer. 1:1): “The 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ words of Jeremiah”... (ibid. 30:6): “Ask now and see whether a male gives birth, etc.” (II Sam. 23: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 1): “And these are the words of David”... (verse 6): “But the wicked are all as thorns thrust 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ away.” “The words of Koheleth...The sun rises...All the rivers run into the sea.” He refers to the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wicked as the sun, the moon, and the sea, which have no reward. So it was taught in Sifrei (Deut. 1:1). 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ I learned from there that the section deals with the wicked and compares them to the rising of the sun, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which ultimately sets. Addendum: Another explanation: All the rivers run into the sea. What is the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ meaning of this? This is stated concerning idolaters, the fools who prostrate themselves to the water 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and think that it has substance since they see the Great Sea, into which all the rivers run, and it is not 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ full, but they do not know that to the place where the rivers flow, they repeatedly go, for the water of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the rivers that flow into the sea is the very same water that already flowed. They flow from under the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ deep and go above the ground until the sea and repeatedly flow. Therefore, the rivers do not stop, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the sea does not become full, and not because they have substance. End of addendum. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ Koheleth

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ soil is esteemed over everything, for even the king must be subservient to the field; if the earth 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ produced fruits, he will eat, but if not, he dies from hunger. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ [9] Whoever loves silver will not be

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that he does not gather for himself produce—this too is vanity. Another explanation: \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ [8] And the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ loftiness of the land is in everything\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  The reward of Israel is in all words of Torah, both in Scripture, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ in Mishnah, and in Gemara. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ the king is subservient to the field\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  If he is [well-versed] in Scripture and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ in Mishnah, he must still be subservient to the one well-versed in Gemara, because he arranges before 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ him the practical decisions of prohibition and permissibility, uncleanness and cleanness, and laws of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ jurisprudence. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ [9] Whoever loves silver\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Whoever loves Torah, will not be sated with it. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and he who

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ rejoiced to do good in his lifetime, and I saw in the Midrash (Ecc. Rabbah): This refers to Elkanah, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ who led Israel up to Shiloh on the festivals, and on the way that he brought them up on one year he did 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ not bring them up the foll owing year, in order to publicize the matter and to accustom them [to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ perform the pilgrimage]. Therefore, Scripture praises him (I Sam. 1:3): “And that man was wont to go 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ up from his city, etc.” I believe [lit., I say] that this Midrash is [based on] the end of the verse: “for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ God is testimony of the joy of his heart.” This is Elkanah, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ established in the Scriptures, and testified about him: “And that man was wont to go up from his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ city.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ testimony\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Heb. \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ îÇòÂðÆä\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ .

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ as a noun, like (Job 32:5): “for there was no answer \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (îÇòÂðÆä)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  in the mouth of the three men.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ of the joy

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ upon the beard.” A good name, however, goes up, as it is said: (Gen. 12:2): “and I will make your 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ name great.” Good oil is temporary, but a good name is eternal, as it is said: (Ps. 72:17): “May his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ name be forever.” Good oil flows from the flask to the palace, and no more, but a good name goes to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the end of the world. Said Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon: We find that those who had good oil

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ answer you about this matter.” If he was king, why did they call him Nehuchadnezzar, and if 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Nebuchadnezzar, why did they call him king? However, this is what they said to him: To you we say

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 10): “like the garden of the Lord, so the land of Egypt”; (Isa. 24:2): “as with the maidservant, so with 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ her mistress; as with the buyer so with the seller.” Sometimes Scripture compares the former to the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ latter, and sometimes it compares the latter to the former. Here too, it teaches the knowledge of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wind from the knowledge of the womb, i.e., you should not await the wind by looking at the clouds.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ poverty and riches are hidden from you, and you should not refrain from doing kindness because you 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ are concerned, perhaps I will lack some of my possessions and become impoverished. I will not engage

\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ are seized by cramps\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  These are the priests, who are mighty in strength. Said Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Aaron lifted twenty-two thousand Levites in one day. Said Rabbi Hanina: The bird’s crop is a light 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ thing, yet the priest would throw it more than thirty cubits. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and the grinders cease\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  These are the great 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ collections of Mishnah: the Mishnah of Rabbi Akiva, the Mishnah of Rabbi Hiyya, and the Mishnah of

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ engage in the words of Torah. Said Rabbi Samuel: Israel is compared to the grinding of the millstones; 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ just as the millstones are idle neither by day nor by night, here too, (Josh. 1:8): “you shall meditate

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Rabbi Levi said: For eighteen years a heavenly voice went forth and in Nebuchadnezzar’s palace and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ proclaimed: “Wicked slave, go and destroy your Master’s House because His children disobey 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Him.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and all the songstresses are brought low\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  (Isa. 24:9): “In song, they shall not drink wine.” [5]

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ heart was concerned lest He do to him as He did to his predecessors. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and terrors on the road 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Because of this, he will seek omens and portents [to see if] he will succeed on the way that he will go, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ as it is stated (Ezek. 21:26): “For the king of Babylon stood at the crossroads, to divine; he furbished 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the arrows, he inquired of the teraphim.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and the almond tree will blossom\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Jeremiah’s prophecy will 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ grow, as it is said (Jer. 1:11): “I see the rod of an almond tree.” Said Rabbi Eliezer: This almond tree, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from the time it blossoms until its fruits are ripe, are twenty-one days. Likewise, from the seventeenth 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of Tammuz until the ninth of Av are twenty-one days. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and the grasshopper will drag itself along 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ This is Nebuchadnezzar’s image (Dan. 3:1): “its height sixty cubits, its width six cubits.” Now, if its 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ thickness is not six, it cannot stand, and you say that, “he set it up in the plain of Dura”? Said Rav 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Beivai: They set it up and it fell; they set it up and it fell, until they brought all the gold in Jerusalem 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and poured it out as a base on its feet, to fulfill what is stated (Ezek. 7:19): “and their gold will be

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ exile of Zedekiah by eleven years. When Nebuchadnezzar exiled the exile of Zedekiah in neck irons, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the exile of Jeconiah came out toward Nebuchadnezzar against their will, with the rest of the city 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ dwellers, to praise him, that he was a hero and a victor, and they would see the captives and ask them, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ each one about his kinsman, what happened to him, and they would answer them, (Jer. 15:2): “Such as 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ are for death to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sword.” And they would praise with one hand, and with their other hand, they would clap their hands 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and beat their sides in mourning for their brothers and for their children. [6] \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ before the silver cord

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to Egypt, for Johanan the son of Kareah exiled them, and when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Egypt, he
