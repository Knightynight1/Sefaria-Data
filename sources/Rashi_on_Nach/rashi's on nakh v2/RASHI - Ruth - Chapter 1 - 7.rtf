It is already stated, “and she returned from 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the fields of Moab,” and from where would she return if not from the place where she was? But 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Scripture wishes to tell [us] that the departure of a righteous person from a place is conspicuous, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ makes an impression. Its splendor has turned away; its majesty has turned away; the praise of a city 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ has turned away, and likewise (Gen. 28:10): “And Jacob went forth from Beersheba.”
