<b> Joel</b>  <b> Chapter 1</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> to Joel son of Pethuel</b>  -The son of Samuel the prophet who persuaded God with his prayer  (פתה  לאל) . Some say that this prophecy was said in those seven years in which Elisha said: For the Lord  has decreed a famine etc. and they took place during the days of Jehoram son of Ahab.  <b> 2</b>  <b> Did this come about</b>  -I.e., what is mentioned below.  <b> 4</b>  <b> What the shearing locust left over</b>  - Gazam, arbeh, yelek, hasil are species of locusts and he  prophesied concerning them that they would come in those days and destroy all the fruit of the trees  and the herbs of the field.  <b> 5</b>  <b> the strong wine</b>  -Heb.  עסיס , good wine.  <b> 6</b>  <b> For a nation has ascended upon my land</b>  -He named these locusts as a host of nations. <b> molars are like those of a young lion</b>  -These are the thick teeth with which he chews.  <b> 7</b>   into a disappointment -Heb.  לקצפה , into a disappointment. <b> he has peeled it and cast it off</b>  -  He has peeled off the bark of the tree and cast it off until the branches of the vine have become white.  <b> 8</b>  <b> Lament</b>  Heb.  אלי . Lamentations  (קינה)  is translated into Aramic as  א יליא .  <b> 9</b>  <b> have been cut off</b>  Heb.  הכרת , like  נכרת . The hey vowelized with a short kamatz takes the place of  a nun. Comp. (Job 5:23), And the beast of the field made peace  (השלמה)  with you.  <b> 11</b>  <b> Be ashamed</b>  Heb.  הבישו  <b> plowmen</b>  Heb.  אכרים . Those who guide the plowshare. <b> for barley</b>  -This refers back to the plowmen, and concerning the vine dressers, he says...  <b> 12</b>  <b> The vines have dried up, and the fig trees have been cut off</b>  Heb.  הובישה , it was cut off, its  produce terminated. <b> has dried up</b>  Heb.  הביש , like  יבש   <b> 14</b>  <b> Proclaim a fast</b>  Heb.  קדשו , designate a fast <b> an assembly</b>  Heb.  עצרה , a gathering.  <b> 15</b>  <b> Woe</b>  Heb.  אהה . An expression of sighing and wailing. <b> and like plunder</b>  Heb.  וכשד . Like the  plunder of brigands. <b> it will come</b>  -from the Omnipresent.  <b> 16</b>  <b> from before our eyes</b>  -I.e., we see it.  <b> 17</b>  <b> have gathered mold</b>  Heb.  עבשו , have gathered rust and mold. in French moisir, to become moldy. <b> casks of wine</b>  Heb.  פרדדות . Jonathan  renders: casks of wine. <b> under their bungs</b>  Heb.  מגרפתיהם . Jonathan  renders:  מגופתיהון , the cover of the cask. <b> the storehouses are laid desolate</b>  -I.e. the  storehouses of wine and oil. <b> garners are demolished</b>  -Granaries of wheat.  <b> 18</b>  <b> herds of cattle are perplexed</b>  -They are confounded.

Since it is in the construct state, it is vowelized with a hataf segol.  <b> 6</b>  <b> gather blackness</b>  Heb.  ק בצו פארור . Blackness like a pot, Cf. (Num. 11:8) And they cooked in a  pot  (בפרור) . The aleph is superfluous, and it is not read.  <b> 7</b>  <b> and they do not make... crooked</b>  Heb.  ועבטון . This has no comparison, but its interpretation  according to its context is: they do not make crooked.  <b> 8</b>  <b> and upon the swords</b>  Heb.  ובעד השלח , (verse 9) through the windows  (בעד הח לונים) . Upon the  weapons they fall and camp. <b> they do not receive monetary gain</b>  Heb.  לא יבצעו . They do not  receive monetary gain. And Jonathan  interpreted it  (השלח)  as an expression of an errand. Because of the  errand of the Holy One, blessed be He, they cast themselves down, and they do not receive monetary  gain.  <b> 9</b>  <b> In the city they clatter</b>  Heb.  ישקו . This is an expression of making a din. Cf. (Isa. 33:4) like the  roaring  (כמשק)  of the cisterns; (Prov. 28: 15) A growling  (שוקק)  bear; (Zeph. 2:9) the clattering of  (ממשק)  the thorns. Jonathan , however, renders it as an expression of arms  (נשק) . They are armed.  <b> 10</b>  <b> the heavens tremble</b>  -Because of the retribution coming upon Israel, they quake and tremble. <b> withdraw their shining</b>  -Take in their light.  <b> 11</b>  <b> And the Lord gave forth (upon them) His voice</b>  -by the statement of His prophets prior to His  sending this host of His. <b> for His camp is great</b>  -I.e, the camp He will send against you if you do not  improve.  <b> 13</b>  <b> and not your garments</b>  -for I do not pay heed to the rending of your garments. Another  explanation: Rend your hearts and you will not need to rend your garments because of mourning. <b> He repents of the evil</b>  -I.e., He turns to another thought.  <b> 14</b>  <b> Whoever knows</b>  -that he is guilty of iniquity. <b> shall return and repent, and it shall leave</b>  -I.e., the  hasil and the gazam will leave a blessing after it; through the repentance, a blessing will come in the  produce.  <b> 16</b>  <b> assemble the elders</b>  Heb.  קבצו . This is of the form of (I Kings 18:19) Send and gather  (קבץ)  for  me, an expression which is weak and light.  <b> 17</b>  <b> a derision</b>  Heb.  לחרפה  <b> for nations to make them an example</b>  Heb.  למשל , an expression of, (Deut.  28:37) for an example  (משל)  and for a conversation piece.  <b> 18</b>  <b> And the Lord was zealous for His land</b>  Heb.  ויקנא , an expression similar to (Num. 11:29) Are  you zealous  (המקנא)  for me? Their distress entered His heart, and He fought their battle and engaged  in their necessities. Our Sages explain it as an expression of warning. He warned the locusts  concerning His land. [from Sotah  3a]  <b> 19</b>  <b> derision</b>  Heb.  חרפה , a derision, that they will call you ill-provided.  <b> 20</b>  <b> And the northerner</b>  Heb.  הצפוני . This can be interpreted as referring to the host of locusts, upon  which the expression, and I will drive him to a land barren and desolate, fits aptly. Another  explanation: The people that come from the north, viz., the kings of Assyria. And our Sages (Sukkah  52a) state: This is the temptation, which is hidden  (צפון)  in a persons heart. <b> the western sea</b>  the  eastern sea. And our Sages, who interpreted it [i.e.,  הצפוני ] as a reference to temptation, interpreted  these two seas as the First Temple and the Second Temple. I.e, they explain  הקדמוני  as first and  האחרון  as last. And so they explained it: Because he directed his face toward the First Temple and the Second  Temple and destroyed them. [God says: I will drive him out to a land barren and desolate, where he  will find no one to incite. That will be because he set his sights for the First Temple and for the Second  Temple and, because he incited the people to sin, they were destroyed. The two Temples, where  everyone would gather during the three Pilgrimage Festivals, are symbolized by the sea, where water  of the streams gather.] And, according to the Targum , who explains it as a reference to the king of  Assyria, we must explain his face to the eastern sea, and his end to the western sea to mean that part  of his army I will send to the east and part of it to the west. <b> its ill savor</b>  Heb.  צחנתו . The word  באשו , its  stench, indicates concerning that it is an expression of filth. <b> for it did great things</b>  -I.e, it did a great  evil, for it stretched forth its hands upon the great.  <b> 21</b>  <b> Have no fear, O land</b>  -I.e, the land of Israel, when you repent.  <b> 23</b>  <b> the teacher for justification</b>  Heb.  מורה . Your prophets who teach you to return to Me, in order to  justify you. <b> the early rain and the late rain.</b>  Heb.  מורה , like (Deut. 11:14) the early rain  (יורה)  and  the late rain  (ומלקוש) . <b> in the first month</b>  -In Nissan. Although the early rain is the first rain, which  falls on the seeds, and that is in Marcheshvan, that year they sowed in Nissan, as is explained in  Tractate Taanith  (5a) that the grain grew in eleven days.  <b> 24</b>  <b> shall roar</b>  Heb.  והשיקו , an expression of making noise when the stream runs down from the  winepress into the vat  (היקב) , which is the pit before the winepress   <b> Chapter 3</b>  <b> 1</b>  <b> And it shall come to pass afterwards</b>  -in the future. <b> upon all flesh</b>  -I.e, upon anyone whose heart  becomes soft as flesh. Comp. (Ezekiel 36:26) And I will give you a heart of flesh.  <b> 3</b>  <b> and pillars of smoke</b>  Heb.  ותימרות . Perpendicular pillars of smoke, as tall as a palm tree.  <b> 4</b>  <b> shall turn to darkness</b>  -to embarrass those who prostrate themselves to the sun.  <b> 5</b>   And it shall come to pass that whoever shall call etc. as... said  -And where did He say  it? (Deut. 28:10), And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the Name of the Lord  is called on you. [from Mechilta , Ex. 12:25] <b> and among the survivors</b>  -And in the remnant that  will remain. <b> whom the Lord invites</b>  Heb.  קרא , an expression of those invited to a banquet or to the  service of the king, an expression of invitation.   <b> Chapter 4</b>  <b> 2</b>  <b> to the Valley of Jehoshaphat</b>  -I will descend with them to the depth of justice. <b> Jehoshaphat</b>  -The  judgments of the Lord.  <b> 3</b>  <b> they cast lots</b>  Heb.  ידו . Like (Lam. 3:53) And they cast  (ו ידו)  a stone upon me.  <b> 4</b>  <b> Are you paying Me recompense</b>  -Is this the recompense for what Solomon gave Hiram, the king of  Tyre, twenty cities (I Kings 9:11)? <b> swiftly</b>  Heb.  קל מה רה , an expression of eagerness.  <b> 8</b>  <b> to the Shebaites</b>  -To the children of Sheba. <b> for the Lord has spoken</b>  -Now where did He speak?  (Gen. 9:25) A slave of slaves shall he be to his brothers. So it is explained in Mechilta  (Ex. 12:25).  <b> 9</b>  <b> prepare war</b>  -if you can wage war against Me.  <b> 10</b>  <b> your plowshares</b>  Heb.  אתיכם , koltres  in O.F:, colters. <b> and your pruning hooks</b>  Heb.  ומזמ רותיכם ,  serpes in French.  <b> 11</b>  <b> Gather</b>  Heb.  עושו . Like  חושו , hasten, so did Menahem associate it. Jonathan , however, renders:  they shall gather, and I say that it is an expression of a block of iron  (עשת) , which is gathered together,  masse in French, and the tav is not a radical. <b> there the Lord shall break your mighty men</b>  Heb.  הנחת . There in the gathering of the Valley of Jehoshaphat, He will break your might. So did Jonathan  render it, but I do not know whether it is an Aramaic expression of lowering  (נחת)  or an expression of  breaking  (חתת) , and the nun is defective. Cf. (Dan. 2:25) brought Daniel in  (הנעל)  before the  king, which has no radical but  על .  <b> 13</b>  <b> Stretch out a sickle etc.</b>  -Draw the swords, you who go on My mission to destroy the nations. <b> the harvest is ripe</b>  -I.e, for their time has arrived, and he compared the matter to harvest, which is  harvested with sickles when it becomes completely ripe. <b> come press for the winepress is full</b>  -of  grapes. Come and tread them; i.e., the measure of their iniquity is full. <b> press</b>  Heb.  רדו , an expression  of pressing [or ruling]. Cf. (Gen. 1:28) And rule  (ורדו)  over the fish of the sea. <b> roar</b>  -The sound of the stream of the wine going down in the vats before the winepresses is heard.  <b> 14</b>  <b> in the valley of decision</b>  -For there it is decided that the judgment is true. And so did Jonathan  render: the valley of judgment.  <b> 15</b>  <b> have withdrawn their shining</b>  -Have taken in their shining.  <b> 16</b>  <b> shall roar from Zion</b>  -Because of what they did to Zion. <b> and the heavens and earth shall quake </b> -He will deal retribution upon the heavenly princes and then upon the nations. <b> a shelter</b>  Heb.  מחסה , an  expression of a cover, abrier  in O.F., abri in modern French, a shelter.  <b> 18</b>  <b> springs</b>  Heb.  אפיקי , a place of the source of water. <b> and water the valley of Shittim</b>  -According  to its apparent meaning, and it will water the valley of Shittim (Targum ), and, according to its Midrashic  meaning, He will atone for the iniquity of Peor.  <b> 19</b>  <b> Egypt etc. and Edom</b>  -He juxtaposed them as regards their retribution. You find that, were it not  for Egypt, Edom would not exist, as it is stated: (I Kings 11:16 21) For Joab and all Israel remained  [stationed] there for six months etc. every male in Edom. And it is stated there: (verse 17) Adad  fled, he and some Edomite men etc. And Hadad pleased Pharaoh very much etc. And Hadad etc. that  David slept with his fathers etc. And, at the end, (verse 25) And he was an adversary to Solomon  (sic). Said the Holy One, blessed be He: I will destroy both of them. <b> the children of Judah</b>  -Because of the violence they did to the children of Judah, viz., that they shed  their blood.  <b> 21</b>  <b> Now should I cleanse, their blood I will not cleanse</b>  -Even if I cleanse them of other sins in their  hands, and of the evils they have done to Me, I will not cleanse them of the blood of the children of  Judah. When will this come to pass? At the time the Holy One, blessed be He, dwells in Zion.
