I cannot 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ explain this to mean a nose, either in reference to its simple meaning or in reference to its allegorical 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ meaning, for what praise of beauty is there in a nose that is large and erect as a tower? I say, therefore,

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of the forehead, which is the main recognizable feature of the face, as it is said (Isa. 3:9): ìThe 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ recognition of their faces testified against them.î And you should know, for he progressively praises

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Whoever stood on it could look and count how many houses there were in Damascus. Another

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Jerusalem until Damascus, for it is destined to expand as far as Damascus.
