Haninah b. Papa said: “The Holy One blessed is He said

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ said: “This man that I am sending you to is wont to make vows just as it is stated... ‘how he swore unto 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the Lord and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob, if I will enter the tent which is my 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ house...’ (Psalms 122:2). Perhaps he will say I will not eat nor will I drink until I do that (build the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Temple) and I will find Myself incurring him loss.”
