\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ slew all three shepherds in one month. Jehu slew the entire house of Ahab, and the house of Ahaziah 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the king of Judah, and his brothers, and all the seed of the kingdom of David; and Athaliah slew the

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Sages depicted the development of a woman with a metaphor: \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ÙÃ«‚Ã»‰\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , unripe figs; \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ·Ã…Á«Ï\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , larger figs, and

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ larger figs in the days of her youth, when she is already bigger. They brought this verse as proof of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ their words.
