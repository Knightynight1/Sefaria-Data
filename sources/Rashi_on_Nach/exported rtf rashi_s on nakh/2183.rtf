\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wicked, whose wickedness brought about that he was delivered into your hands, as the matter is stated 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ in II Chron. 28:18: “And the Philistines raided the cities of the lowlands...” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ that the rod that smote 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ you has been broken\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  that the kingdom of the House of David, which was wont to smite you, has been 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ weakened and humbled, as we find concerning David, and so, concerning Uzziah, king of Judah, who 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ smote you, as the matter is stated (II Chron. 26:6): “And he went out and fought against the Philistines 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and breached the wall of Gath.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ for, from the root of a snake\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  From the root of that snake, shall 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ emanate a venomous serpent, which is more formidable than a snake. Now who was this? This was 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Hezekiah, concerning whom it is stated (II Kings 18:8): “He slew the Philistines up to Gaza and its 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ boundaries, from watchtower to fortified city.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and his offspring is a fiery flying serpent\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Jonathan 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ renders: And his deeds against you will be like flying snakes.
