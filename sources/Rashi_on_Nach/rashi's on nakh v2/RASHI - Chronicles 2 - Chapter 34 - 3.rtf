\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ started to seek after the God of David his father. This is similar to (Gen. 37:2): “and as a youth, with

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ thirty years old, he would not have done it. It is, however, surprising, that he (Josiah) was a youth, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ nevertheless, he started to seek, etc. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ he started to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places,

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ rebuilt the high places that Hezekiah his father had demolished, etc.”
