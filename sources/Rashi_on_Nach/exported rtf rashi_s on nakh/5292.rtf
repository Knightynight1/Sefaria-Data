\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ find in \lang1033\ltrch\f3\fs30\b0\i\ul0\cf3\cb11\ Midrash Leviticus Rabbah\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  (13:4) that he was Esther’s son. Now, in the days of Cyrus I, Zerubbabel 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and Joshua the Priest went up from Babylon to Jerusalem with the sanction of Cyrus, as it is said (Ezra 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 1:3): “Whoever is among you of all His people, etc.” The adversaries of Judah and Benjamin rose up 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and sent their letters to Cyrus to [have him] ordain that they [Judah and Benjamin] stop the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ construction of the Temple, which they had commenced; and he gave the order and stopped it. From 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that day they stopped, as is explained in Ezra (4:24): “Then the work of the house of God was 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ stopped, etc.” It was stopped for the three years that Cyrus reigned, the fourteen years of Ahasuerus, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and the first year of Darius his son. In the second year [of Darius] this prophecy was proclaimed to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Haggai: to urge them [i.e., Judah and Benjamin] to resume the building, and that they should not fear, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for the heathens would not stop them for the Holy One, blessed be He, would grant them success.
