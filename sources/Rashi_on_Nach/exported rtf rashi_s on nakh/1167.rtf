It is like the sheath at the end of the handle of the spear 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which is called arestojjl in French, and is made like the hat. Its parallel is [found in T.B.]

Now I heard that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ on that day he was initiated into the wearing of armor. Since it is common for the [newly] initiated to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ perform [an act of] victory and heroism on the day of their initiation in order to acquire a reputation, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he therefore thought to smite David.
