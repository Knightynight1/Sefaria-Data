<b>the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz</b> Said Rabbi Levi: We have a tradition from our ancestors that Amoz and Amaziah, king of Judah, were brothers.
<b>which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem</b> Now, did he not prophesy concerning many nations, viz. the prophecy of Babylonia (ch. 13), the prophecy of Moab (ch. 15)? Thus you learn that this is not the beginning of the Book, and that the Book is not given its name for this prophecy. So we learned in the Baraitha of the Mechilta (Exod. 15: 9,10): “In the year of King Uzziah’s death” (6:1) is the beginning of the Book, but there is no early and late in the order [i.e., the order of the chapters is no indication of the chronological order. (Others read: There is no early and late in the Book—Parshandatha.] The context proves this point, for, on the day of the earthquake (see Zech. 14:5), the day Uzziah became a metzora (see 2 Chron. 26:19), it was said: “Whom shall I send and who will go for us?” And I said, “Here I am; send me” (6:8). We learn that this was the beginning of his mission, and this prophecy was said afterwards. And concerning this alone, it is stated: which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, just as Scripture says concerning each nation, “the prophecy of such and such a nation.” Here too, Scripture writes: “which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.” Since they are harsh reproofs, he calls them “chazon,” which is the harshest of the ten expressions by which prophecy is called, as is stated in Gen. Rabbah (44:7), and proof of this is the verse (infra 21:2), “A harsh prophecy (חָזוּת) was told to me.”
<b>in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</b> These four kings he buried, [i.e. he outlived,] in his lifetime. On the day Uzziah became a metzora, the Shechinah rested upon him, and he prophesied all the days of these kings, until Manasseh arose and killed him. (And this prophecy was said in the days of Hezekiah after the ten tribes were exiled.)

<b>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth</b> And Moses said, “Give ear, O heavens,...and may the earth hear” (Deut. 32:1). Why did Isaiah change the wording? Our masters taught concerning this matter, [and] many midrashim [are] in the section entitled “Ha’azinu” in Sifrei, but the Sages disagreed with them and said: A matter is not so unless witnesses come and testify. If their words coincide, their testimony is fulfilled; if not, their testimony is not fulfilled. Had Isaiah not addressed the heavens with giving ear and the earth with hearing, the heavens would testify and say, ‘When we were called to this testimony in Moses’ time, when he said, (Deut. 30:19) “I call heaven and earth to witness against you,” we heard with an expression of giving ear,’ and the earth would testify, ‘I was called with an expression of hearing,’ hence their testimony would not coincide. [Therefore,] Isaiah came and reversed the matter. Consequently, both are found to testify with an expression of giving ear and with an expression of hearing.
<b>for the Lord has spoken</b> That you should be witnesses in this matter, when I warned them in Moses’ time. Therefore, come and hear what I reason with them, for they transgressed the warning, I did not sin against them, but I raised them and exalted them, yet they rebelled against me. [Another version reads:] That you should be witnesses in this matter. Now, where did He speak? “Give ear, O heavens and I will speak” (ibid. 32:1). [So this was taught] in Mechilta (Bo 12).
@3
<b>his owner</b> Heb. קֹנֵהוּ [is] like מְתַקְּנוֹ, the one who affixes him to the plowshare for plowing by day, and since he has accustomed him to this, he knows him. The dull donkey, however, does not recognize his master until he feeds him. Israel was not intelligent like the ox, to know, when I called him and said, “Israel will be your name” (Gen. 35:10), and I informed them of several of My statutes, yet they deserted Me, as is related in Ezekiel (20:39): “Let each one go and worship his idols.” Even after I took them out of Egypt and fed them the manna and called them, “My people, the children of Israel,” they did not consider even as a donkey. Another explanation is:
<b>An ox knows its owner</b> An ox recognizes his owner so that his fear is upon him. He did not deviate from what I decreed upon him, by saying, I will not plow today. Neither did a donkey say to his owner, I will not bear burdens today. Now, these [creatures,] who were created to serve you, and are not destined to receive reward if they merit, or to be punished if they sin, did not change their manner, which I decreed upon them. Israel, however, who, if they merit receive reward, and if they sin are punished.
<b>does not know</b> i.e., did not want to know; they knew but trod with their heels, and my people did not take heart to consider.
@4
<b>Woe</b> Every instance of הוֹי in Scripture is an expression of complaining and lamenting, like a person who sighs from his heart and cries, “Alas!” There are, however, several, which are an expression of a cry, the vocative voice, e.g., “Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north” (Zech. 2:10), which the Targum renders, אַכְלוּ, an expression of announcing.
<b>Woe</b> There is a reason to cry about a holy nation that turned into a sinful nation, and a people referred to by the expression, “for you are a holy people” (Deut. 7:6), turned into a people with iniquity.
<b>a people heavy with iniquity</b> The heaviness of iniquity. The word denotes a person who is heavy, pesant in French, ponderous. The word כֶבֶד is a substantive of heaviness, pesantoma in French, and is in the construct state, and is connected with the word עָוֹן, iniquity.
<b>evildoing seed</b> And they were seed whom the Lord blessed (Isa. 61:9). Similarly, they were children of the Holy One, blessed be He, and they became corrupt.
<b>they provoked</b> Heb. נִאֲצוּ, they angered.
<b>they drew backwards</b> [The root נְזִירָה,] wherever it appears, is only an expression of separation. Similarly, Scripture states: “And they shall separate (וְיִנָּזְרוּ) from the holy things of the children of Israel” (Lev. 22:2), “the one separated (נְזִיר) from his brothers” (Gen. 49:26). Here too, they drew away from being near the Omnipresent.
@5
<b>Why are you beaten...</b> A person who was punished (lit. beaten) and repeats his sinhis friend admonishes him and says to him, For this you have been punished, yet you do not take heart to say, ‘For this I have been punished. I will not repeat it again.’ Here too, why are you beaten since you continue disobedience, to turn away from following the Omnipresent? Is not every head afflicted with illness and every heart with malaise? Why then do you not understand?
@6
<b>soundness</b> An expression of perfection, sound without pain.
<b>wounds</b> Heb. פֶּצַע, i.e., a wound of a sword.
<b>contusions</b> Heb. חַבּוּרָה, an expression of a bruise. [Some editions read:] Other bruises.
<b>and lacerated sores</b> Jonathan renders: מְרַסְסָא, lacerated and crushed.
<b>and lacerated sores</b> demarcejjre, in O.F., and in the language of the Talmud, we find, “he bumped (טַרְיֵה) his head” (Chullin 45b). Menahem explained it as an expression of moisture, i.e., moist and wet, always oozing [muyte in O.F.].
<b>they have not been sprinkled</b> These lesions were not sprinkled with medicinal powders by physicians. This is an expression of: (Job 18:15) “Sulphur shall be sprinkled (יְזֹרֶה) on his dwelling.” Menahem explained it as an expression of healing, as in (Jeremiah 30:13): “No one pronounced your judgment for healing (לְמָזוֹר).”
<b>neither was it softened with oil</b> Their wound was not softened with oil, as is customary with other wounds. It would be inappropriate to say here, “They were not softened with oil,” for they soften only the place of the sore, not the wound and the contusion but the sprinkling and the bandaging applies to all three, [i.e., the wound, the contusion, and the lacerated sore.] Therefore, the plural number applies to them; the lesions were not sprinkled and not bandaged. Jonathan interprets the entire verse figuratively, referring to the fact that they were soiled and afflicted with iniquity. Accordingly, he rendered, “From the sole of the foot until the head,” from the smallest to the greatest, there is no soundness. There is none good among them, wounds and contusions, rebellious deeds, iniquities, and inadvertent sins.
<b>they have not been sprinkled...</b> i.e., they have not been healed by repenting wholeheartedly, nor has it been softened with oil, not even a trace of repentant thought has entered their heart.
@7
<b>in your presence, strangers devour it</b> Before your eyes, your enemies will devour it.
<b>and desolate</b> of you as a heritage turned over to strangers, which is desolate of its owners. Jonathan renders in this manner.
@8
<b>And the daughter of Zion shall be left</b> devoid of its inhabitants, for they will be exiled from its midst, as a hut in a vineyard, made by a watchman, and when the produce of the vineyard is gathered, he leaves his hut and goes away, after they gather it.
<b>like a lodge in a cucumber field</b> As the lodge, which the watchman made at the end of a cucumber field, to watch its cucumber, is left, for after it is gathered, he leaves it and goes away; the one in the vineyard is called a hut since he lives in it day and night; by day, he guards it from the birds and by night from the thieves, b ut cucumbers are hard, and there is no fear of the birds, and one need not watch them by day. It is, therefore, called a lodge since it is a place of lodging at night. Jonathan renders: Like a bed in a lodge (again repeated in Hebrew), [in] a cucumber field, in a cucumber field after it has been picked (בָּתַר דְאַבְעָיוּהִי), after it has been picked. [This is the expression of the Mishnah] (Peah 4:5): “There are three gatherings (אַבְעָיוֹת) a day.”
<b>like a besieged city</b> Like a city which was besieged, and they make huts around it to hide the troops, and when they give up the siege [lit., when they go away from it], they leave them and go away. All this is Jonathan’s translation.
@9
<b>Had not the Lord of Hosts left us a remnant</b> by His own volition and with His mercy, not because of our merits.
<b>we would soon be like Sodom</b> All of us would be destroyed.
@10
<b>rulers of Sodom</b> Princes whose deeds are like those of Sodom. From here, [the Rabbis] deduced that a person should not open his mouth to Satan.
@11
<b>I am sated with the burnt-offerings of rams</b> This is similar to: “Lest he have too much of you and hate you,” (Proverbs 25:18).
<b>fattened cattle</b> Fattened cattle and sheep.
<b>I do not want</b> Since you transgress My Torah, the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination [from Prov. 21:27].
@12
<b>who requested this of you, to trample My courts</b> to trample [the preposition is absent in the Hebrew] My courts, since your heart is not whole with Me.
@13
<b>You shall bring no more vain meal-offerings</b> I warn you, you shall not bring Me your vain meal- offering, for the smoke that rises from it is smoke of abomination to Me, and not for My satisfaction.
<b>New moons and Sabbaths, calling, convocations, I cannot...</b> and [sic, does not appear in Parshandatha] to call convocations, i.e., New Moons and Sabbaths when you gather to call a convocation and an assembly on them, I cannot bear the iniquity in your hearts that is inclined to paganism, and the convocation with it, for these two things are incompatible: to call a convocation to gather before Me, and the iniquity that is in your hearts for paganism, and you do not take it out of your hearts.
@15
<b>And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you</b> because your hands are full of blood.
<b>blood</b> Murder.
@16
<b>Wash, cleanse yourselves</b> Voweled with a ‘patach,’ the imperative form, since it is derived from רְחַץ, but רָחֲצוּ, [in the past tense, is voweled with a ‘kamatz’ because it is derived from רָחַץ].
<b>Wash, cleanse yourselves, remove, learn, seek, strengthen, perform justice, plead, go</b> Ten exhortations of the expression of repentance are [listed] here, corresponding to the Ten Days of Penitence and to the ten verses of Kingship, Remembrances, and Shofaroth [in the musaf service of Rosh Hashanah].
<b>cease to do evil</b> Desist from your evil deeds.
<b>to do evil</b> Heb. הרע, like לְהָרֵעַ, to do evil. [Rashi explains this because the preposition is absent in Hebrew.] Scripture does not have to write מֵהָרֵעַ, desist from doing evil, for so does the Biblical language treat the expression of חֲדָלָה, stopping, [e.g.,] “and he failed to make (לַעֲשׂוֹת) the Pesach” (Num. 9:13); “until he stopped counting (לִסְפֹּר)” (Gen. 41:49). That is to say, the counting stopped, the making failed, here too, stop the evildoing.
@17
<b>Learn</b> It is punctuated ‘raphe,’ weak, without a dagesh. This is from the form לָמֹד, learn to do good. One who teaches himself is of the ‘kal’ form. Therefore, its imperative plural is voweled with a ‘chirik’ like אִמְרוּ, שִׁמְעוּ, but one who teaches others is of the form of the ‘heavy conjugation’ (pi’el) with a ‘dagesh,’ and if one comes to command a number of people, the word is voweled לַמְּדוּ. And so, דִּרְשׁוּ, from the form דְרשׁ, but אַשְּׁרוּ in which the ‘shin’ has a ‘dagesh,’ is from the ‘heavy conjugation,’ and from the form אַשֵּׁר ; therefore, the imperative plural is voweled with a ‘patach’ like בַּשְּׂרוּ, סַפְּרוּ, דַּבְּרוּ.
<b>strengthen the robbed</b> Heb. אַשְּׁרוּ חָמוֹץ. This is a Mishnaic term, אֲשַׁרְנוּהִי, “we have verified it” (Ketuboth 21a); “if I had strength (אֲיַשֵּׁר)” (Gittin 30b); “May your strength be strengthened (יִישַׁר)” (Shabbath 87a). Another explanation is: Lead him in the path of truth to acquire what rightfully belongs to him. An expression of: (Job 23:11) “My foot held its path (בֲּאֲשׁוּרוֹ)”; (Prov. 23:19) “And go (וְאַשֵׁר) in the way of your heart.” (
<b>perform justice</b> So-and-so is innocent and so-and- so is guilty.
<b>plead the case of the widow</b> Endeavor in their quarrel to plead for her, for she cannot go out to pursue her opponents.)
<b>the robbed</b> Heb. חָמוֹץ, similar to (Ps. 71:4) “from the hand of the unrighteous and the robber (וּמְחַמֵּץ).”
@18
<b>Come now, let us debate</b> together, I and you, and we will know who offended whom, and if you offended Me, I still give you hope to repent.
<b>If your sins prove to be like crimson</b> Stained before Me like crimson red, I will make them as white as snow.
<b>says the Lord</b> [The verb is in the future form to denote that] He always says this to you, like: (Num. 9:20) “By the word of the Lord they would camp (יַחֲנוּ),” also a future form. Another explanation is: Come now, let us debate. What is written above this? “Cease to do evil; learn to do good.” And after you return to Me, come now, and let us debate together, to notify Me, “We have done what is incumbent upon us; You do what is incumbent upon You;” and I say, “If your sins prove to be like crimson, they will become white as snow...”
<b>as crimson dye</b> Heb. תּוֹלָע, lit. a worm. Dye with which they dye fabrics red. They are kernels, each one of which has a worm inside it. Hence the name תּוֹלָע.
@20
<b>for the mouth of the Lord spoke</b> Where did He speak? (Lev. 26:25) “And I will bring upon you a sword.”
@21
<b>a harlot</b> Astray from her God.
<b>city</b> which was faithful and full of justice, and righteousness would lodge therein, but now murderers.
<b>full of justice</b> Heb. מְלֵאֲתִי מִשְׁפָּט [equivalent to מְלֵאַתמִשְׁפָּט, the ‘yud’ being superfluous,] as in (Lamentations 1:1) רַבָּתִי עָם, “great in population” [equivalent to רַבַּתעָם].
<b>in which righteousness would lodge</b> The daily dawn sacrifice would atone for the sins [committed] at night, and the daily afternoon [sacrifice] would atone for those of the day. Another explanation is that they would allow capital cases to rest overnight when they could find no merit for him, [i.e., for the defendant;] they would not conclude his verdict until the morrow, perhaps they would find a merit for him, and now they have become murderers. [We find in] Pesikta [d’Rav Kahana p. 121a]: Rabbi Menahem bar Oshia [according to Parshandatha,] Rabbi Phinehas in the name of Rabbi Oshia said: Four hundred eighty-one synagogues were in Jerusalem, corresponding to the numerical value of מְלֵאֲתִי.
<b>and now murderers</b> They killed Uriah; they killed Zechariah.
@22
<b>Your silver has become dross</b> They would make copper coins and plate them with silver, in order to cheat with them.
<b>your wine is diluted with water</b> Your drinks are mixed with water, as is stated in Pesikta (122b). [The word] means ‘mixed,’ although there is no similar word in Scripture to prove it, but the Midrash Aggadah explains (Ecc. 2:2): “Of laughter I said, it makes one mad (מְהוֹלָל)” to mean that it is confused, or mixed up.
@23
<b>rebellious</b> Deviating from the straight path.
<b>and runs after payments</b> This word is similar to the Talmudic תַּשְׁלוּמִין. Jonathan paraphrases: One man says to another, Do me a favor in my case, and I will repay you in your case. This refers to a judge who was a robber, and the robbery victim complains about him before another judge. This one says to him, Declare me innocent today, and I will repay you when they complain about you before me. This is the meaning of running after payments.
<b>and the quarrel of the widow does not come to them</b> The widow comes to complain, and the orphan is coming out, when this one meets him and asks him, What did you accomplish in your case? He replies, All day long I toiled at work, but I did not accomplish anything. And this one turns around and says, If this one, who is a man, did not accomplish anything, surely I will not. This is the meaning of, “the orphan they do not judge, and the quarrel of the widow does not come to them” at all.
@24
<b>says the Master</b> Who possesses everything, and in Whose power it is to uproot you from your land and to settle others in it.
<b>the Mighty One of Israel</b> the strength of Israel.
<b>Oh</b> Heb. הוי. An expression of preparation and announcement, and similar to this is (Zech. 2:10): “Ho, ho, (הוי הוי) flee from the land of the north.” And let all know that I will console Myself of My adversaries, who angered Me with their deeds.
@25
<b>And I will return My hand upon you</b> One blow after another, until the transgressors have been completely destroyed.
<b>as with lye</b> This is an expression meaning soap [sbon in O.F., savon (in modern French)]. Its deviation is an expression of cleanliness, similar to (Ps. 24:4): “and pure (בַּר) of heart,” since it cleanses the garment of its stains.
<b>your dross</b> mentioned above, as: “Your silver has become dross”; a mixture of silver with copper is called dross. Here too, a mixture of the wicked with the righteous. I will destroy the transgressors, who are all dross.
<b>all your tin</b> The tin mixed with silver, that is to say, the wicked among you. בְדִיל is called estejjn [etain] in O.F. [tin].
@26
<b>as at first</b> I will appoint for you pious judges.
<b>City of Righteousness</b> As in the beginning, righteousness will lodge therein.
@27

<b>and her penitent</b> those penitent among them. (
<b>through righteousness</b> through those who make themselves righteousthrough justice and through righteousness—that are in her midst [or,] among them.)
@28
<b>And destruction shall come upon rebels...</b> For with all these expressions he reproved them above: and they rebelled against Me (verse 2), sinful nation; they forsook the Lord (verse 4).
<b>rebels</b> Rebels and sectarians and those who worship idols.
<b>and sinners</b> Apostates guilty of other sins.
@29
<b>of the elms</b> Heb. מֵאֵלִים, an expression derived from אֵלָה, a species of tree called olme in O.F. [orme in modern French, an elm].
<b>that you desired</b> to worship idols under them, similar to what is stated (Hosea 4:13): “Under the oak and the aspen, and the elm, for its shade is good.”
<b>because of the gardens</b> There they would worship idols, as it is stated (infra 66:17): “Those who prepare themselves and purify themselves for the gardens.”
@30
<b>whose leaves wilt</b> Its leaf ([Other editions read:] whose leaf) wilts, becomes wilted [flatisant in O. F.]. When heat or cold comes upon it, it wilts and its moisture is lost and destroyed. [The word] נבל is not an expression of decay like בלה, for no ‘nun’ is found in that expression, but נבל [is an expression of something that becomes fatigued and its strength is curtailed, from the root of] נָבֹל תִּבֹּל (Exod. 18: 18), which Onkelos renders: You will surely be exhausted.
<b>that has no water</b> to water its seeds; to the thing with which they sin, he compares their punishment.
@31
<b>the[ir] strength</b> with which they take from the poor by force and rob them and strengthen themselves with the money. That money will become as tow, which is shaken out of the flax, which is light and easily ignited.
<b>and its perpetrator</b> The one who amasses this power will become as a spark of fire, and they will burn, one with the other.
<b>as a spark</b> Heb. וּפֹעֲלוֹ לְנִיצוֹץ, estencele in O.F. [etincelle in modern French], a spark. Jonathan renders וְעוֹבַד יְדֵיהוֹן, and the work of their hands. This does not follow the Hebrew, however, for, were it so, it would have to be voweled וּפָעֳלוּ with a ‘kamatz- chatuf,’ a hurried ‘kamatz,’ and it would be explained as an expression of work. Now, that it is voweled with a ‘cholam,’ it is an expression of a worker, or perpetrator.
<b>with no one to extinguish</b> Jonathan renders: And no one will pity them.

<b>O house of Jacob...</b> The nations will say this to them, and this verse refers back to the verse [commencing with], “And many peoples shall go...”
<b>come and let us go in the light of the Lord</b> They will say this to them. Jonathan, however, renders: And those of the house of Jacob will say, [“Come and let us go in the teaching of the Law of the Lord”].
@6
<b>For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob</b> The prophet addresses the Shechinah and says, “For until now You have forsaken Your People because of their iniquity.” [Other editions read:] “...that which You have forsaken Your people was because of their iniquity, for they are full of [witchcraft] from the East,” and the entire section, and all the chapters follow one another, until (ch. 5) “I will sing now...” Therefore, in the end of days, when the sinners perish, it will be good for them(Parshandatha). (Another explanation is: The prophet admonishes them and says this to them, “For you have forsaken your people, O house of Jacob...” You have forgotten [the deed of your people—Parshandatha] the good deed through which you became a people, you house of Jacob.)
<b>for they are full...from the east</b> Their hosts have become full of the deeds of the Arameans who dwell in the East, who were sorcerers and used the name of pagan deities. [Other editions read:]...and used the name of defilement [sorcery and demonism—Rashi ad loc.], as we say in Ch. Chelek (Sanh. 91a): “Abraham gave gifts” (Gen. 25:6)He gave them the name of defilement and sent them away to the land of the East [as quoted by Parshandatha].
<b>and with children of gentiles they please themselves</b> They cohabit with the daughters of the heathens and mingle with them, and they would bear children to them, with whom they are always pleased, and they occupy themselves [with them] and long for them and bother with them. This is an expression similar to [that of] (Job 36:18) “lest he incite you because of abundance (בְּשֶׂפֶק)” [debatement in O.F].

@16
<b>And over all the ships</b> Jonathan renders: And over all those who inhabit the islands of the sea, who go and come by ship.
<b>Tarshish</b> The name of a sea called Tarshish.
<b>and over all coveted floors</b> Heb. שְׂכִיוֹת, palaces paved with coverings of marble floors, similar to: (Lev. 26:1) and a covering stone (וְְאֶבֶן מַשְׂכִּית), since they cover the ground with it.
@17

@20
<b>to prostrate himself to moles</b> Heb. לַחְפֹּר פֵּרוֹת, idols in the likeness of moles, a species of rodents who dig in the earth, called talpes in O.F. [taupes in modern French].
<b>and to bats</b> kalbe soric [chauvesouris in modern French]. Alternatively, this may be interpreted to mean that man will cast his idols that he made for himself, before which to prostrate himself, into pits and ditches that he finds before him when he goes to escape and hide.
@22
<b>Withdraw yourselves from man</b> not to heed those who cause you to stray from following Me and to prostrate yourselves to the work of his hands.
<b>whose breath is in his nostrils</b> Whose entire life and strength are dependent upon the breath of his nostrils, which is a fleeting spirit, in him today and leaving him tomorrow. Surely the image of the moles and the bats has no substance. Another explanation is: Withdraw yourselves from all the evil ways and learn from the man who has a soul in his nostrils. Have you seen to what he is esteemed? Surely the image of his handiwork is of no esteem.

<b>And I will appoint youths as their princes</b> These are people devoid of any observance of the commandments.

But I say that according to the simple meaning, תַּעֲלוּלִים means scornful people, people who mock them, as (Job 16:15): “I soiled (וְעוֹלַלְתִּי) my radiance in the dust,” and (Exod. 10: 2): “how I mocked (הִתְעַלַּלְתִּי) the Egyptians.”

<b>And the people shall be oppressed</b> They shall be pressed and oppressing each other with competition and strife.
<b>they shall behave haughtily, the youth against the elder</b> The youth will raise himself over the elder.
<b>and the base against the honorable</b> [This is to be interpreted] according to its simple meaning. The exegetical meaning is as follows: Let one to whom grave interdicts seem light come and raise himself over one to whom light interdicts seem grave.

<b>When a man shall seize his brother</b> When a man shall seize his brother in his father’s house, saying, “You are wealthy in Torah, and it is as white to you as a garment.”
<b>be an officer to us</b> and teach us.
<b>and this obstacle</b> upon which we are stumbling, in prohibition or permissibility, in defilement or in purity, shall be under your hand, for you know how to instruct us. Another explanation is: You have a garment to clothe the naked.
<b>and this obstacle</b> fajjlejjnca in O.F. [faibless in modern French]. My want, that I lack bread, is under your hand to supply me. Therefore, you shall be to us as an officer. He replies, In my house there is neither bread nor clothing. What then are my qualifications as an officer?
@7
<b>He shall swear on that day</b> [lit. he will raise. The word יִשָּׂא] is only an expression of swearing; he will swear to them, I will not be a ‘Chovesh.’ I will not be one of those confined to the study hall, since, in my house there is neither bread nor clothing; I have understanding neither of the Mishnah nor of the Aggadah. Another explanation according to the simple meaning is: I will not be a confiner; I will not be a judge, who confines the convicts to prison.
@8
<b>For Jerusalem stumbled</b> They are all faulty and falling, and no one assists the next one. Why? Because they refused to obey, and now, they all provoke.
<b>for their tongue and their deeds are against the Lord</b> [lit. to the Lord;] against Him to provoke Him.
<b>to provoke the eyes of His glory</b> to provoke before His glory. Another explanation is: to provoke the matters of His glory.
@9
<b>The recognition of their faces</b> The sin that they recognize faces [i.e., show favoritism] in judgment testified against them before Me. Another version is: The recognition of their faces—They are recognizable by the boldness of their faces.
<b>like Sodom they told, they did not deny</b> They committed [sins] publicly.
@10
<b>Praise the righteous man for he is good</b> Say to the righteous man that he did good.
@11
<b>Woe to the wicked [who does] evil</b> For he is bad to himself and to others; he brings about harm to himself and to others. [This is found] in Tanchuma (Emor 5). This verse refers back to: Say to the righteous that he is good and woe is to the wicked [who does evil].
@12
<b>their rulers are mockers</b> Heb. נֹגְשָׂיו מְעוֹלֵל, they are mockers.
<b>and women govern them</b> Heb. נָשִׁים. Adulterous women govern them, as he states below (verse 16): “Since the daughters of Zion were haughty,” and they turned their hearts to evil; therefore, all weaklings governed them. Jonathan renders it as an expression of creditors (נוֹשִׁים) [rendering: and as creditors they govern them].
<b>Your leaders</b> Heb. מְאַשְּׁרֶיךָ. Your leaders, who should have led you on the good way, lead you astray.
<b>they have destroyed</b> Spoiled.
@13
<b>stands to plead</b> [i.e., to judge the case] of Israel standing, so to speak, so as not to be strict in their judgment.
<b>and stands to judge the nations</b> Heb. ועמד. He delays and dwells on their judgment. This expression of standing means delay.
@14
<b>The Lord will enter into judgment with the elders of His people</b> For they should have protested (Shabbath 55a), and to the nations He says, And you have ravaged My vineyard. I became slightly incensed [against them,] and you helped to do harm.
<b>the spoils of the poor</b> [Of] a poor generation, for they were poor in good deeds. All this is in the Midrash Aggadah, but according to its simple meaning, the entire section deals with Israel, and “stands to judge the peoples,” refers to the tribes.
<b>and you have ravaged the vineyard</b> The elders and the officers ‘ate up’ the rest of the people.
@15
<b>What to you mean</b> Heb. מַלָּכֶם, like מַה לָכֶם, what do you mean? [lit. What is to you?]
<b>you grind</b> Crush and degrade to disgrace them in their lawsuit.
@16
<b>And the Lord said</b> Concerning the women who governed My people, “Since the daughters of Zion are so haughty...”
<b>and winking eyes</b> Heb. וּמְשַׂקְּרוֹת, an expression of looking. Another explanation is: They paint their eyes with vermilion or with blue eye shade.
<b>walking and raising themselves they walk</b> Heb. ותפוף. This is an expression of something floating on another, as (Deut. 11:4): “over whom He caused...to flow (הֵצִיף),” which the Targum renders as אַטֵיף. Thus, a tall one would walk between two short ones, in order to appear to be floating over them (Shabbath 62b). Jonathan, however, renders: and with wigs they surround themselves. They would tie wigs, braids of cut-off hair. They would twist together with their braids so that they would appear thick and broad.
<b>and with their feet they spout venom</b> When they would pass in the street near Jewish youths, they would stamp their feet and hint to them of the affection of the adulteresses, in order to arouse their temptation, like the venom of a serpent. עֶכֶס is the venom of a serpent.
@17
<b>And the Lord shall smite with zaaraath</b> Heb. וְשִׂפַּח. This is an expression of zaraath [believed to be a form of leprosy, see Commentary Digest II Kings 5:1], as (in Leviticus 13:6): “It is a mispachath (מִסְפַּחַת).” But since it is written with a ‘sin,’ our Sages expounded about it that they would become enslaved maidservants (שְׁפָחוֹת), and some expounded it to mean that He smote them with many families (מִשְׁפָּחוֹת) of lice.
<b>shall pour out their “vessels”</b> Heb. פָּתְהֵן יְעָרֶה. Their vessels He shall pour out. This is the Aramaic language, like “a black vessel” פַּתְיָא אוּכְמָא [in] (Pesachim 88a). They would say, Let Him hurry and hasten His deed, to bring on the invaders. An officer will see me and take me. When the retribution came, Nebuchadnezzar’s officers took them for wives because of their beauty. Thereupon, the Holy One, blessed be He, signaled to their ‘fountains,’ and blood of an issue flowed from them profusely, as a person pours from one vessel to another. They became loathsome to them, and they cast them to the ground from upon their chariots (Lamentations Rabbah 4:15). Jonathan, however, rendered: He will remove their glory. פתהן means wideness or greatness.
@18
<b>On that day</b> In the future, when the Holy One, blessed be He, will come to restore Israel to Him, the Lord shall remove from them the glory of the shoes, that they will not depend for their glory on the beauty of women’s jewelry and objects of vanity.
<b>the shoes</b> The shoes that were on their feet with which they spouted venom.
<b>and the embroidered headdresses</b> Heb. והשביסים. Types of headdresses for the ornaments of the head. Many [instances of this word] are found in the language of the Mishnah: the embroidered headdress (שביס) of the hair net (Kelim 28:10).
<b>and the hair nets</b> Heb. וְהַשַׂהַרֹנִים. Jonathan renders: the hair nets.
@19
<b>The necklaces</b> [Jonathan renders:] עַנְקַיָא, necklaces, an expression similar to (Proverbs 1:9): “And necklaces (עֲנָקִים) for your throat.” They are called נְטָפוֹת, meaning “to drip,” because they hang on the neck and drip onto the breast, and they are a sort of pierced pearls, strung on a string, mostnecs in O.F.
<b>and the bracelets</b> Heb. וְהַשֵּׁרוֹת, bracelets for the arm, translated וְשִׁירַיָא.
<b>and the veils</b> Heb. וְהָרְעָלוֹת. A veil with which they envelop their entire countenance except the eyeball, so that a man will desire to satisfy himself by gazing at the cheeks. Another explanation is that they are types of pretty shawls, with which to enwrap themselves, and in the language of the Mishnah, there is an instance: “Shawled (רְעוּלוֹת) Arabian women,” in Tractate Shabbath (65a).
@20
<b>The tiaras</b> Heb. פְּאֵרִים. The Targum renders: tiaras. This resembles (Exodus 39:28): “the beautiful hats (פַּאֲרֵי הַמִּגְבָּעוֹת).”
<b>and the foot chains</b> Heb. וְהַצְּעָדוֹת, circlets for the legs.
<b>and the hair ribbons</b> [Lit. ties,] as the name implies, short ties with which they tie their hair, and some make them gilded, fres in O.F.
<b>and the clasps</b> Heb. וּבָתֵּי הַנֶּפֶשׁ, [the houses of the soul] opposite the heart, nosche in O.F.
<b>and the earrings</b> Heb. לְחָשִׁים, rings for the ear, the place into which people whisper (לוֹחֲשִׁים).
@22
<b>The tunics</b> Heb. הַמַּחֲלָצוֹת. [Jonathan renders:] כִּתּוּנַיָּא as in Samuel (2 2:21): and take to yourself his clothing (חֲלִיצָתוֹ), for the body is clothed with them, and when they are removed, they are removed from the body (חוֹלְצִין).
<b>and the bedspreads</b> Heb. וְהַמַּעֲטָפוֹת, bedspreads, according to the Targum, who renders שׁוֹשִׁיפַיָא.
<b>and the tablecloths</b> Heb. וְהַמִּטְפָחוֹת, tablecloths. and the purses Heb. וְהַחֲרִיטִים. [Jonathan] translates it as מַחְכַּיָּא, [an ornament] bearing the shape of the woman’s private parts, as we translate כּוּמָז (Ex. 35:22) as מָחוֹךְ.
@23
<b>The mirrors</b> Heb. גִּלְיוֹנִים. These are mirrors, as the Targum renders: מַחְזְיָתָא, miradojjr in O.F., and because they reveal (מְגַלּוֹת) the form of the face, they are called גִּלְיוֹנִים, or perhaps their mirrors were rolled (נִגְלָלוֹת).
<b>and the sheets</b> of linen with which they would enwrap themselves.
<b>and the turbans</b> Heb. וְהַצְּנִיפוֹת, molekin in O.F.
<b>and the clasps</b> Heb. וְהַרְדִידִים, Fermalc in O.F., and they are of gold with which the shawl is closed when the woman enwraps herself therein.
@24
<b>And it shall come to pass, that, instead of perfume, there will be decay</b> The place where they would perfume themselves will be decayed.
<b>and in the place of a girdle, laceration</b> Heb. נקפה. The place where she girded herself, there will be lacerated, cut with wounds and signs of blows, as (Job: 19:26): “And after my skin is cut to pieces (נִקְּפוּ)”; (infra 10:34) “and the thickets of forest shall be cut down (וְנִקַּף).”
<b>and in the place of the deed, a wound</b> Heb. (מַעֲשֶׂה מִקְשֶׁה). [The place where they would do the deed mentioned above: “walking and raising themselves they walk,” and that is at the height of the head, there will be] מִקְשֶׁה קָרְחָה, a wound that makes the head bald. מִקְשֶׁה is an expression similar to (Daniel 5:6): “knocked one against the other (נַקְשָׁן).” I would explain it as follows: The place where they would put the plates of gold made by hammering batdec in O.F.but it is vowelized in the Masorah among the ten words vowelized with a ‘pattach’ [i.e., a ‘segol,’ and none of them is connected to the following word, and every [instance of the word] that is in the construct state is vowelized with a ‘kamatz’ [i.e., a ‘tzeireh’].
<b>and in the place of the organ of levity</b> Heb. וְתַחַתפְּתִיגִיל. This is like two words: פְּתִי גִיל, a vessel [or organ] that brings levity; the secret parts about which is mentioned above: shall pour out their ‘vessels.’ Instead of that levity, a girdle of sackcloth will be on all loins.
<b>for this is instead of beauty</b> For this is fitting for them to have instead of the beauty with which they acted haughtily.

<b>her gates</b> The gates of the towns and houses. In all their gates will be lamentation.
<b>and she shall be emptied out</b> Heb. ונקתה, lit., and she shall be cleansed, meaning: and she shall be emptied of everything, like (Amos 4:6): “And behold, I have given you cleanness of teeth (נִקְיוֹן שִׁנַּיִם),” [meaning hunger,] and in the language of the Mishnah; “So-and-so was cleaned out (נקי) of his belongings” (Baba Kamma 41a).
<b>she shall sit on the ground</b> [This denotes figuratively that they will be reduced] from a high station to a low one. (Lam. 2: 10) “...shall sit on the ground and remain silent,” on the Ninth of Av.

@1
<b>Now seven women shall take hold of one man</b> because of the many widows.
<b>take away</b> Heb. אסף [lit., gather in,] hide our reproach, similar to (Deut. 22:2): “And you shall gather it (ואספתו) into your house.” For the woman, when she is married, will not be dealt with licentiously. According to Midrash Aggadah, (Lamentations Rabbah 5:11) Nebuchadnezzar commanded (or decreed upon) [his armies] not to have relations with married women, lest they be punished. They, therefore, begged to be nominally married.
@2
<b>On that day</b> After the beauty of the ornaments of the adulteresses and the wanton women is curtailed, the glory of My people and the beauty of their honor will no longer depend upon these things.
<b>the sprout of the Lord shall be</b> to you for beauty.
<b>for beauty and for honor</b> They are the righteous who remain among them, and the sages, the students of the Torah; upon them will they depend the beauty of their honor.
<b>and the fruit of the land</b> They are the children of the righteous, the fruit of the Tree of Life. They shall be for greatness and glory, for the survivors of Israel will boast and praise themselves with them. צְבִי means ‘beauty,’ an object of desire, for there is desire in it.
@3
<b>And it shall come to pass, that every survivor</b> among them will settle in Zion.
<b>and whoever is left</b> anywhere, shall dwell in Jerusalem.
<b>“holy” shall be said of him</b> All of them will be righteous. Now lest you say that the righteous who died prior to this day have lost their honor, the Scripture states: “anyone inscribed for life,” in the Hereafter, will be in Jerusalem.In this manner, Jonathan translates it.
@4
<b>When the Lord shall have washed away</b> Heb. אִם [usually “if.”] When the Lord shall have washed away. There are instances of אִם being used in this manner in the usage of כִּי ; and so (Job 8:18): “But when (אִם) men destroy him from his place,” is [equivalent to] כִּי יְבַלְּעֶנּוּ. Also (Gen. 24:9): “Until when (אִם) they will have finished drinking.”
<b>filth</b> Defilement, as its Aramaic translation; i.e. to say, when He will remove their iniquity through chastening and purging from the world.
<b>He shall rinse</b> Heb. יָדִיחַ, an expression of ‘washing’ in the language of the Mishnah, and in Scripture (Ezek. 40:38): “There they will rinse (יָדִיחוּ) the burnt offering.”
<b>with a spirit of judgment</b> through chastening. ‘spirit’ [is equivalent] to talant in O.F. When He so desires to judge them.
<b>and with a spirit of purging</b> to purge them from the world, בָּעֵר is like לְבָעֵר, to purge, descombrement in O.F., an expression of doing, going.
@5
<b>וְעַל מִקְרָאֶהָ</b> and over those summoned therein.
<b>a cloud by day and smoke</b> to protect them from the nations.
<b>for, in addition to every honor</b> stated to them, shall be a shelter, for I will cause My Shechinah to cover them. Seven chupoth [shelters or canopies] are [mentioned here]: cloud, smoke, splendor, fire, flame, shelter, Shechinah.
@6
<b>And a tabernacle shall be for shade...from heat</b> to protect from the burning of the future sun, as it is said in regard to the wicked (Malachi 3:19): “And the coming sun shall set them ablaze,” for the Holy One, blessed be He, will take the sun out of its case, and cause it to burn them.
<b>and for a shelter</b> Heb. וּלְמַחְסֶה. [This is] an expression of covering.
<b>and for a covert</b> in which to hide.
<b>from stream</b> of fire gushing forth from the river of fire on the wicked in Gehinnom, as it is said (Jeremiah 23:19): “On the heads of the wicked it shall rest.” [This is found] in Tractate Chagigah 13b.
<b>and from rain</b> the rain that falls on the wicked, as in the manner stated in Psalms 11:6: “He rains on the wicked burning coals.”

@1
<b>I will now sing for my beloved</b> The prophet says: “I will now sing for my beloved and in his place and as his messenger. [The word לִידִידִי would usually mean, ‘to my beloved.’] Similar to (Exodus 14: 4): “The Lord will wage war for you (לָכֶם), for you [not ‘to you’].”
<b>the song of my beloved about his vineyard</b> This is the song of my beloved that he sang for his vineyard, about his vineyard, as (Genesis 26:7): “And the people of the place asked about his wife (לְאִשְׁתּוֹ), about his wife [not ‘to his wife’].”
<b>a vineyard in a fertile corner</b> in a corner that produces fat fruit, like good oil.
<b>fertile</b> Heb. בן-שמן [lit. the son of oil, i.e.,] a corner fit for oil, for olives to produce oil, [like] (I Samuel 20:31) בֶּן-מָוֶת, [lit. a son of death,] fit to die. This is a parable, and at the end of the section, he will explain it.
@2
<b>And he fenced it in</b> Heb. וַיְעַזְּקֵהוּ. He fenced it and walled it around, surrounded like a sort of ring, translated into Aramaic as עִיזְקָא.
<b>and he cleared it of stones</b> Heb. וַיְסַקְלֵהוּ. He cleared it of the stones that are detrimental to the vines, comp. (infra 62:10) “Clear of stones (סַקְּלוֹ מֵאֶבֶן).”
<b>and he planted it with the choicest vines</b> They are the best of all branches for planting.
<b>and he built a tower in its midst</b> A press in which to press the grapes.
<b>and also a vat he hewed therein</b> Heb. יֶקֶב, the pit that is before the press, to receive the wine. Likewise, every יֶקֶב in Scripture is an expression denoting a pit. Likewise (Zechariah 14:4), עַד יִקְבֵי הַמֶלֶךְ, which Jonathan renders, “Until the King’s pits.” This is the depth of the ocean. Therefore, the expression of hewing applies, just like (Deut. 6:11): “and hewn pits.”
<b>and he hoped to produce grapes</b> And my beloved hoped that this vineyard would produce grapes for him.
<b>and it produced wild berries</b> Heb. בְּאֻשִׁים. Similar to grapes, and they are called lanbrojjses in O.F.
@5
<b>I will remove its hedge</b> I will remove the fence that covers and protects it. מְשׂוּכָה is a fence of thorns; גָדֵר is a fence of stones.
<b>and it shall be</b> [i.e.,] the vineyard.
<b>eaten up</b> For cattle and wild beasts will graze there.
@6
<b>And I will make it a desolation</b> Heb. בָתָה, an expression of desolation and emptiness. Compare (infra 7:19): “in the desolate valleys (הַבַּתּוֹת).”
<b>nor hoed</b> Heb. יֵעָדֵר ; this is an expression of digging in a vineyard.
<b>the shamir and desolation will come up</b> Heb. שָׁמִיר וָשָׁיִת. Menahem ben Seruk interprets them as kinds of thorns (Machbereth Menahem p. 176), but I say that “shamir” is a word denoting a strong worm that splits stones, with which Solomon built the Temple, like the matter that is written (Ezekiel 3:19), “Like a shamir, stronger than rock.”
<b>desolation</b> Heb. שַׁיִת, an expression similar to (Lamentations 3:47), “desolation (הַשְׁאֵת) and breach,” an expression similar to (infra 6:11), “shall be made desolate (תִּשָּׁאֶה) [as a wilderness”; i.e., it will be] empty with no one seeking it to enter it, and thereby worms will overrun it.
@7
<b>For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel</b> To this vineyard are you compared, O House of Israel, for all that He did for this vineyard, He did for Israel. The vineyard represents Adam, for we find in Midrash Aggadah, in many places in Tanhuma, and in Genesis Rabbah [that] these passages are expounded concerning him, e.g., Adam was not expelled from Paradise until he reviled and blasphemed, as it is said: And He hoped to produce grapes,... (Gen. Rabbah 19:12). And in another place we find: He appointed guards over him that he should not eat from the Tree of Life, as it is said (verse 6): “And I will command the clouds...” (ibid. 21:8). And in this manner, [the following verses] can be expounded concerning him:
<b>(1) My beloved had a vineyard. A vineyard</b> This [alludes to] Adam.
<b>My beloved</b> This is the Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>In a fertile corner</b> in the Garden of Eden.
<b>(2) And he fenced it in</b> with the ten canopies mentioned in Ezekiel (28), in the section dealing with Hiram, king of Tyre.
<b>And He cleared it of stones</b> Of temptation, until he ate from the tree, and temptation gained entry into him.
<b>And He planted it with the choicest vines</b> The beginning of his formation was from the place of the altar.
<b>And He built a tower in its midst</b> And He breathed into his nostrils the spirit of life, from the heavenly beings.
<b>And also a vat He hewed therein</b> A spring flowing, the fountain of wisdom.
<b>And He hoped to produce grapes</b> that he would thank Him and praise Him.
<b>And it produced wild berries</b> putrid things; he reviled and blasphemed.
<b>(3) Judge now</b> Since the end of the parable comes to say that they too did like him, he asks them the judgment.
<b>(5) I will inform you</b> what I decided to do to him and I did.
<b>I removed its hedge</b> I expelled him from amidst his canopies.
<b>And it shall be eaten up</b> His end will be to die and to be ruled over by wild beasts.
<b>Breach its wall</b> I expelled from the enclosure of Paradise.
<b>(6) And I made it a desolation</b> I made him dwell in desolation, for I did not give the Torah in his days.
<b>It shall neither be pruned nor hoed</b> They will learn from him neither merit nor good deeds.
<b>The shamir and desolation will come up</b> Temptation ruled over him and his posterity, to perform corrupt deeds.
<b>And I commanded the clouds</b> I appointed guards over him to guard the way of the Tree of Life.
<b>(7) For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel</b> For the House of Israel is to Me like that vineyard; The ten tribes were to Me like a vineyard producing wine, like an olive orchard, in a fat corner, in a fat land, [producing anointing] oil for the priesthood, [anointing] oil for the kingdom, oil for the Menorah, oil for the meal offerings. I fenced them in first with the encirclement of the clouds of glory in the desert and I cleared them of stones, i.e., I cleansed them of the transgressors of the generation. I planted them with the choicest vines (שׂוֹרֵק) six hundred and six commandments, like the numerical value of שׂוֹרֵק, I added for them to the seven commandments that the children of Noah were commanded. I built a tower in their midst, My Tabernacle and My Temple, and also a vat, the altar and the pits [the pits by the side of the altar into which the remainder of the libations was poured.]
<b>(2) And it produced wild berries</b> They corrupted their deeds.
<b>(3) And now, dwellers of Jerusalem and men of Judah</b> who have not yet been exiled, please judge between me and between them concerning the evil that I brought on them; who sinned against whom?
<b>What more could I have done</b> beneficial deeds
<b>for My vineyard, and I have not done</b> for it?
<b>(5) Now I will inform you</b> Even you who anger Mewhat is fitting in My eyes to do to My vineyard, according to all that I did to Adam, viz.
<b>to remove its hedge</b> I will remove My Shechinah from them, the Shechinah that covers them, as it is said (infra 22:8), “And He bared the covert of Judah.”
<b>Breach its wall</b> I will demolish its walls.
<b>(6) And I will make it a desolation</b> And I will make them forsaken [from Targum Jonathan].
<b>It will neither be pruned nor hoed</b> They will not be visited nor will they be supported. [from Targum Jonathan].
<b>And the shamir and desolation will come up</b> And they will be wandering and forsaken, represented by the שָׁמִיר וָשָׁיִת [desolation] of the vineyard, and regarding the vineyard itself in another place, it is rendered הֲבָאִי וּבוּר, desolate and fallow.
<b>And I will command the clouds</b> And I will command the prophets not to prophesy on your behalf [Jonathan]. Prophecy is analogous to rain, which the clouds receive from heaven; so do the prophets receive the divine prophecy.
<b>The plant of His joy</b> Comp. נָטָע (Job 14:9), but since it is in the construct state, it is vowelized with a patach, like (Num. 7:88) בְּקַר זֶבַח הַשְּׁלָמִים, “the cattle of the peace offerings.”
<b>and He hoped</b> that they would perform justice, and behold, there was מִשְׂפָּח, an accumulation of sin upon sin, like (I Sam. 26:19), “From cleaving (מֵהִסְתַּפֵּחַ),” also (ibid. 2:36), “Take me now into (סְפָחֵנִי).” Another explanation is that it is an expression of a lesion, and since it is a similar expression, for, in pronunciation, מִשְׂפָּח resembles מִשְׁפָּט, and so, זְעָקָה resembles צְדָקָה, it fell through divine inspiration into the prophet’s mouth.
@8
<b>Woe to those who join a house to a house</b> Twenty-two instances of אַשְׁרֵי, fortunate, were said in the Book of Psalms concerning those who fulfill [the tenets of] the Torah, and Isaiah said twenty-two times, “הוֹי,” woe, concerning the wicked.
<b>Woe</b> An expression of a cry of a sigh concerning the impending retribution.
<b>those who join a house to a house</b> They draw their houses one to the other, thereby taking the land of the weak poor man between the two houses, and so
<b>a field to a field they draw near until there is no place</b> No place for the poor man to live.
<b>and you will be settled alone in the midst of the land</b> You think that neither the Holy One, blessed be He, nor the poor, have a share in the land. His share of the tithes you are stealing, and the poor, [you are robbing] of their land, so that you alone will occupy it.

<b>In my ears [spoke] the Lord of Hosts</b> Said the prophet, Both my ears heard when the decree was decreed upon them by the Lord, and with an oath, “Truly, because of this thing, great houses will become desolate, yea, large ones and good ones, without inhabitants.”
@10
<b>For ten acres of vineyard</b> And, because of the famine, the inhabitants of the house will be exiled, leaving no one dwelling in them. This, too, will be for your payment in kind for bringing one field near to the other field, for you have stolen the share of the Omnipresent in the tithe of the land.
<b>ten acres of vineyard</b> arpent in French, and I say that the amount of land requiring the work of one day with a yoke of oxen is called צֶמֶד, a yoke.

<b>harp and lute</b> A lute has more strings than a harp. [Perhaps Rashi explains נֵבֶל as a lyre, which may have more strings than a harp.] Now why is it called נֵבֶל? Because it disgraces (מְנַבֵּל) all kinds of musical instruments. In Midrash Tehillim (81:3).
<b>tamborine</b> That was made of skin.
<b>a flute</b> A flute of reed, chalemel in O.F.
<b>and the work of the Lord they do not regard</b> And in the Torah of the Lord they did not look [from Jonathan].
<b>and the deed of His hands they have not seen</b> They pretended that they did not see His mighty deeds. Another explanation is: They did not praise Him in the morning by reciting, “He Who forms light,” nor in the evening, by reciting, “He Who brings on the evenings.”

They caused Him to appear as a man who is stunned. [The expression originates in Jeremiah 14:9]. And so Scripture states (Deut. 32:18): “The Rock that begot you, you have weakened (תֶּשִׁי),” [interpreting the word as originating from תָּשׁ, weak,] and Scripture states [further] (Ecclesiastes 10:18): “Through slothfulness, the One Who frames His upper chambers will become impoverished.”

[Variant reading: According to their habit, with equity and of their own, for there will no longer be wicked people in the world, who will rob them.] Our Rabbis expounded כְּדָבְרָם to mean: According to all that was spoken regarding them, [i.e.,] the consolations spoken for them.

<b>And He shall raise</b> i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>an ensign to the nations</b> and signal to them to gather and to come upon them. Raising an ensign (נֵס) is like a long pole (כְּלוּנָס), at the end of which they attach a cloth, [i.e., a flag,] and they climb to the top of a lofty mountain and see it from afar; and that is the sign for people to gather. Comp. (infra 49:22) “And to peoples I will raise My ensign (נִסִּי)”; comp. also (Numbers 21:8), “And set it upon a pole (נֵס),” meaning a pole (כְּלוּנָס), perche in French, but since it is for a sign, it is called נֵס.

<b>and behold darkness</b> for they will have no support. וְנִבַּט is in the passive voice (נִפְעַל) like וְלֹא נִפְתַּח, will not open up, וְלֹא נִתַּק, will not be torn, and the ‘vav’ causes the tense to be reversed to the future. Ediert esvuardeyd in O.F.
<b>the distressed one and the light shall darken</b> Comp. (infra 31:3) “And the helper shall stumble and the one who is helped shall fall.” He who is distressed, upon whom the trouble has come, as well as he who comes to bring light to him, both of them will darken. Some interpret צַר as the moon, whose light was diminished, צַר [meaning narrow,] and אוֹר as the sun, [meaning light].
<b>in its eclipse</b> Heb. בַּעֲרִיפֶיהָ. When its darkening comes. An expression similar to (Deut. 32:2): “Shall drip (יַעֲרֹף) like rain,” for so is the nature that when rain falls, the light darkens.

I saw Him sitting on His throne in heaven with His feet in the Temple, His footstool in the Sanctuary, to pass judgment on Uzziah, who came to usurp the crown of the priesthood.
@2

<b>with two he would cover his face</b> so as not to look toward the Shechinah.
<b>and with two he would cover his feet</b> for modesty, so as not to bare his entire body before his Creator. And in Tanhuma (Emor 8), I saw that the feet were covered because they are like the sole of the foot of a calf, in order not to remind Israel of the sin of the golden calf.

@3
<b>And one called to the other</b> They would take permission from one another so that one would not commence before [his fellows] and be guilty of [a sin punishable by] burning, unless they all commenced simultaneously. This is what was established in [the blessing commencing:] “...Who formed light,” “the declaration of holiness, they all respond as one...” This is a Midrash Aggadah of the account of the Merkavah. And so did Jonathan render this.

<b>And the doorposts quaked</b> [Jonathan renders:] אֵילְוַתסִפֵּי, they are the doorposts of the entrance, which are measured with the measurements of cubits in the height and in the width, and they are the doorposts of the Temple.
<b>from the voice of him who called</b> [i.e.,] from the voice of the angels calling. This took place on the day of the earthquake, about which it is stated (Zechariah 14:5): “And you shall flee as you fled on the day of the earthquake in the days of Uzziah.” On the day that Uzziah stood, ready to burn incense in the Temple, the heavens quaked, [attempting] to burn him, as if to say that his punishment should be by burning, as it is said (Num. 16:35): “And it consumed the two hundred and fifty men.” For this reason, Scripture calls them seraphim, for they attempted to burn him. The earth quaked, attempting to swallow him up, thinking that his punishment should be that he be swallowed up like Korah, who contested the priesthood. Thereupon, a heavenly voice emanated and said (ibid. 17: 5), “And there shall not be” another man contesting the priesthood “like Korah” to be swallowed up, “and like his assembly” to be burnt, but, “as the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses,” in the thornbush (Exodus 4:6), “Now bring your hand into your bosom,” and he took it out, stricken with zaraath like snow, here too, the zaraath shone on his forehead.”

@5
<b>for I am lost</b> I will die, for I was not worthy of seeing the Countenance of the Shechinah. We find a similar statement made by Manoah (Judges 13:22): “We shall surely die, for we have seen God.”
<b>I am lost</b> Heb. נִדְמֵיתִי, comp. (Zephaniah 1:11): “The entire people of Canaan is broken (נִדְמֶה).”
<b>people of unclean lips</b> that are defiled with sins [from Jonathan].
@6
<b>a glowing coal</b> Heb. רִצְפָּה, a coal, and similarly, (I Kings 19:6) “a cake baked on hot coals (עֻגַּתרְצָפִים),” like עֻגַּתרְשָׁפִים. In regards to Isaiah and Elijah, however, it is written with a ‘zadi,’ רִצְפָּה, because they spoke ill of Israel. This one [Isaiah] called them a people of unclean lips, and this one [Elijah] said, (ibid. 10) “For...have forsaken Your covenant.” Said the Holy One, blessed be He, to the angel, “Break the mouth (רְצוֹץפֶּה) that spoke ill of My children.”
<b>with tongs</b> Heb. (בְּמֶלְקֳחַיִם) with tongs.
<b>he had taken it from upon the altar</b> that was in the forecourt.
@7
<b>And he caused it to touch my mouth... “...and your iniquity shall be removed”</b> This is to cause pain, to atone for your iniquity that you degraded Israel. And his strength was great, for the angel was afraid to take it without tongs, yet he caused it to touch the prophet’s lip, and he [the prophet] was not injured. [This is found] in Tanhuma (ibid.) This is [the meaning] of what Scripture states (Joel 2: 11): “For His camp is very great,”these are the angels; “and stronger” than they “are those who fulfill His word”these are the prophets (Tanhuma ibid.). Jonathan renders: “And in his hand was a glowing coal,” to mean, “And in his mouth was speech.” The expression רִצְפָּה: [means a thing refined in the mouth and with the tongue] (רָצוּף בְּפֶּה). “From upon the altar,” he received the speech from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be he, from His throne in Heaven, which was directed opposite the altar that was in the Temple.
@8
<b>Whom shall I send</b> to admonish Israel? I sent Amos, and they called him, ‘Pesilus,’ because he was tongue tied, [’Pesilus’ being the Greek word for tongue-tied.] He prophesied two years before the earthquake, and the Israelites would say, The Holy One, blessed be He, left over the whole world and caused His Shechinah to rest on this tongue-tied one, as is stated in Pesikta.

@10
<b>This people’s heart is becoming fat</b> [This structure] הַשְׁמֵן resembles (Exodus 8:11), “And making his heart heavy (הַכְבֵּד),” an expression of a continuous action. Their heart continuously becomes fatter, angrajjsant in O.F., and his ears are becoming heavier and heavier, [i.e., harder and harder] of hearing.
<b>and his eyes are becoming sealed</b> Plastered, comp. (infra 44:18) “For their eyes are plastered from seeing.” הִטּוֹחַ (Leviticus 14:43) is translated into Aramaic as דְאִתְשַׁע. We, thereby, equate the two words הָשַׁע and טָח.
<b>lest he see with his eyes</b> They intended not to hearken to the words of the prophets, for they fear lest His words please them, and they will understand with their heart, and return to Me, and this will be their cure.
@11
<b>Until when</b> will they make their heart heavy and not listen?
<b>And He said</b> I know that they will not repent until retribution comes upon them and they go into exile, and the cities will be desolate without inhabitants.
<b>lies waste and desolate</b> an expression of solitude, without an inhabitant.
@12
<b>and the deserted places be many</b> For the land will be abandoned by them, and this is the explanation of the language: Deserted places will increase in the midst of the land.
@13
<b>And when there is yet a tenth</b> And when they are diminished to one out of ten (Rashi ms.)] even upon this remnant will I return My hand as a purge after a purge, and it will be purged until only completely righteous men will remain, who will repent wholeheartedly.
<b>like the terebinth and like the oak</b> which, at the time of their casting, when they cast off their leaves during the fall, one casting after another casting, until nothing is left in it except the trunk, they too, the holy seed found in its midst, adhering to their holiness, they will be to Me as the trunk; another explanation of מַצַּבְתָּהּ is: its planting. Therefore, I will not destroy them, for I planted them as holy seed. Some explain that there was a Shallecheth Gate in Jerusalem, as it is stated in Ezra (I Chron. 26:16, written by Ezra), and there, terebinths and oaks were planted.

@1
<b>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz</b> What did Scripture see to trace his lineage? But, since the end of the verse states: “And he could not wage war against it,” it teaches you that the merit of his forebears stood him in good stead. The ministering angels said before the Holy One, blessed be He, Woe! Who is this wicked man who has become king? He replied to them, He is the son of Jotham; he is the son of Uzziah. His forebears were righteous. I, therefore, do not wish to harm him. This is the meaning of the words, “and he could not wage war against it,” because of the merit of his forefathers. [This is found in Gen. Rabbah 63:1.]
@2
<b>And it was told to the House of David</b> Since he was wicked, Scripture did not mention his name.
<b>Aram has allied itself with Ephraim</b> lit. has rested upon Ephraim. The king of Aram has joined the king of Israel to attack you. נָחָה is the feminine gender, since the kingdom (מַלְכוּת) joined. Posad in O. F., lay, comp. (Exodus 10:14) “And it rested (וַיַָּנַח) in all the boundary of Egypt.”
<b>and his heart... trembled</b> Since each one individually had already waged war with him and defeated him, as it is said (II Chron. 28:5): “And the Lord his God delivered into the hand of the king of Aram...,” and it states further (v. 6): “And Pekah son of Remaliah slew 120,000 men.” Both verses are in Chronicles.

<b>the upper pool</b> A type of gathering of water that is made for fish.
<b>upper</b> On the incline of the mountain, and there is one below it at its base.
<b>the washer’s field</b> A field in which the washers spread out laundry to dry. So did Jonathan render this. Our Rabbis expounded that Ahaz humbled himself before Isaiah and placed on his head a washer’s utensil, i.e., he inverted a vessel on his head [i.e., a perforated vessel used by the washers, with which they sprinkle water on the clothing].

<b>and provoke it</b> Let us provoke them to war.
<b>and annex it to us</b> Heb. וְנַבְקִיעֶנָּה. Let us even it out with us like a valley (בִּקְעָה) that is even. And so does Jonathan render: And let us even them with us, that they should be even with the ten tribes under one king.
<b>one who is good for us</b> Heb. בֶּן טָבְאַל [a combination of the words: טוֹב אֶל,] good for us; so did Jonathan render it. It is also possible to interpret it as: טוֹב אַל, not good in the eyes of the Omnipresent, and according to the calculation of the letters of ‘al-bam,’ Tov’al is Ramla. ‘Teth’ equals ‘resh’; ‘beth’ equals ‘mem’; ‘aleph’ equals ‘lammed.’ Hence, “ben tov’al” equals ‘ben Ramla.’
@7

@8
<b>For the head of Aram</b> that is Damascus, and Jerusalem has nothing with them.
<b>and the head of Damascus is Rezin</b> In Damascus he shall be head, but not in Jerusalem, and alsoas regards Pekah and the ten tribesin another sixty-five years from the day it was decreed in the days of Amos (7:11): “And Israel shall surely be exiled from upon its land.”
<b>Ephraim shall be broken, no longer to be a people</b> Ephraim shall be shattered, no longer to be a people, for Sennacherib will exile them with their king, Hoshea son of Elah. Go out and calculate from Amos’ prophecy until the ten tribes were exiled, and you will find them to be sixty-five years. Amos’ prophecy was two years before Uzziah was stricken, as it is stated (Amos 1:1): “Two years before the earthquake.” And Uzziah was stricken for twenty-five years, plus these two years, giving us a total of twenty-seven years. Add the sixteen years of Jotham and the sixteen years of Ahaz and six years of Hezekiah, as it is stated (II Kings 18:10, 11): “And they captured it [at the end of three years]; in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which is the ninth year of Hoshea, king of Israel...And the king of Assyria exiled Israel to Assyria.” Here are sixty-five years. Now how do we know that the duration of Uzziah’s state as a confirmed metzora was twenty-five years? For it is stated (ibid. 15:1): “In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam the king of Israel, Azariah the son of Amaziah the king of Judah, became king.” Is it possible to say this? Did not Uzziah and Jeroboam reign simultaneously, according to the calculation you will find in the Book of Kings (See Rashi II Kings 14:22)? Rather he reigned a plagued kingship. In the twenty-seventh year he was stricken, and he reigned for fifty-two years. It is impossible, however, to count “and in another sixty-five years” from the day that Isaiah said this prophecy, for he said it in the days of Ahaz, and they were exiled in the sixth year of Hezekiah. In this manner it is explained in Seder Olam (ch. 28), that Scripture counted from the prophecy of Amos.

<b>Immanuel</b> [lit. God is with us. That is] to say that our Rock shall be with us, and this is the sign, for she is a young girl, and she never prophesied, yet in this instance, Divine inspiration shall rest upon her. This is what is stated below (8:3): “And I was intimate with the prophetess, etc.,” and we do not find a prophet’s wife called a prophetess unless she prophesied. Some interpret this as being said about Hezekiah, but it is impossible, because, when you count his years, you find that Hezekiah was born nine years before his father’s reign. And some interpret that this is the sign, that she was a young girl and incapable of giving birth.

<b>For, when the lad does not yet know to reject bad and choose good</b> the land shall be abandoned by its inhabitants, [i.e.,] the land of Rezin and the land of Pekah.

<b>And I will call to testify for Myself</b> also in those days, in the days of Jehoiakim, concerning that calamity, destined to befall them, two trustworthy witnesses, one to foretell for them the evil that was destined to come upon them, viz. Uriah the priest, whom Jehoiakim dispatched, as it is said (Jer. 26: 20): “And also a man was prophesying in the name of the Lord, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim, and he prophesied concerning this city and concerning this land, according to all the words of Jeremiah.”
<b>and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah</b> who prophesied in the second year of Darius (Zech. 8:4): “Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem.” Uriah is a sign for Zechariah. If you see that Uriah’s prophecy is fulfilled, you can expect that Zechariah’s will likewise be fulfilled, just as I have called to testify concerning Sennacherib, Amos and Isaiah; Amos for the calamity of the ten tribes (Amos 7:11): “And Israel shall surely be exiled,” and Isaiah for his promise to Hezekiah (Isaiah 32,33) [when he would reign].
@3
<b>and she bore a son</b> He is the very son whom the prophetess called Immanuel, since the Holy One, blessed be He, would be at the aid of Hezekiah when he would reign. [It is impossible to say that it was another son, for we learned [in Seder Olam ch. 22] that in the fourth year of Ahaz, this prophecy was said, and in the fourth year of Ahaz, Pekah was assassinated, and it is impossible for two children to be born in one year, one after the other.] And Isaiah his father called him Maher-shalal-hash-baz, because of the calamity destined to befall Rezin and the son of Remaliah, who were coming to wrest the kingdom from the House of David and to curtail the kingdom of Hezekiah.

<b>the wealth of Damascus...shall be carried off</b> And [the] king of Assyria went up to Damascus and seized it (II Kings 16:9).
<b>and the plunder of Samaria</b> After Pekah was assassinated, and Hoshea reigned, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, went up against him, and Hoshea became his vassal, and gave him tribute and a bribe (ibid. 17:3). That is the plunder of Samaria. All this took place in the fourth year of Ahaz.

<b>the waters of the Shiloah that flow gently</b> [i.e., they rejected] the kingdom of the House of David, which leads them gently, like the waters of the Shiloah that flow gently [Jonathan]. Shiloah is a spring, known as Gihon and Shiloah. Here he prophesied concerning Shebna and his company who wanted to rebel against Hezekiah, for they rejected him since they saw that he did not choose a regal table, but would eat a litre of vegetables and engage in the Torah. Concerning him, it is stated (Prov. 13:25): “A righteous man eats to satiate his body.” They saw Pekah son of Remaliah eat forty seahs of pigeons for dessert. They would ridicule Hezekiah and say, Is this one fit to be a king? There is no king but Rezin and the son of Remaliah. They were fit to rule in their lifetimes. And this is the meaning of: “And rejoice in Rezin and the son of Remaliah.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, Do you desire eaters? I will bring many eaters upon you. “Behold the Lord brings upon them the mighty...waters of the river” instead of the weak and gentle waters of the Shiloah.

@11
<b>with the overwhelming power of prophecy</b> [Lit., with strength of the hand.] When the prophecy became more intensive over me, when He continued to speak concerning this matter, as it is written above (v. 5): “And the Lord continued to speak to me.” And in this language, Ezekiel said, (3: 14): “And the hand of the Lord became strong over me.” This is an expression of prophecy.
<b>and admonished me from going...</b> He warned me not to participate in the counsel of Shebna the scribe and his company, who conspired to rebel against Hezekiah, as is related in Sanhedrin (26a), to which there is an allusion in this Book (below 22:15): “Go, come to this voluptuary, to Shebna who is appointed over the Temple.”
<b>and He admonished me</b> like “and to admonish me.”
@12
<b>‘You shall not call a band</b> You of Hezekiah’s company, even though they (sic) are fewer than Shebna’s company, you shall not say: We decide according to the majority (Exodus 23:2. See Rashi ad loc.), to all that this people that is with Shebna, says, for this is a band of the wicked and is not counted, and so it is as regards the ten tribes, who formed an alliance with the kings of Egypt.
<b>and you shall not fear what it fears</b> [i.e.,] what this people fears, for they say to you to fear Sennacherib and to make peace with him.
<b>you shall not fear...nor attribute strength</b> You shall not say that he is strong. So did Jonathan translate: You shall not say strong.
@13
<b>He gives you strength</b> Heb. (מַעֲרִיצְכֶם).
@14
<b>And it shall be for a portent</b> That plan that Shebna plotted and that Pekah plotted to overthrow the kingdom of the House of David, shall be an omen [a preparationmss.] of the disaster destined to befall them.
<b>for a portent</b> Heb. לְמִקְדָשׁ, comp. (Num. 12:18) “Prepare yourself (הִתְקַדְּשׁוּ) for the morrow.”
<b>and for a stone upon which to dash oneself</b> upon which the feet are dashed. This is an expression of stumbling, as (in Jeremiah 13:16): “[Before] your feet are dashed (יִתְנַגְּפוּ),” (Psalms 91: 12), “Lest you dash (תִּגֹּף) your foot on a stone.”
<b>and for a rock upon which to stumble</b> This is synonymous with “a stone upon which to dash oneself,” for a rock is a stone.
<b>for the two houses of Israel</b> who came to be for a snare and a trap for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Now who are the two houses? Pekah son of Remaliah and his company and Shebna and his company.
@15
<b>And many shall stumble upon them</b> Upon those stones, these two and their companies shall fall into the hands of their enemies; Pekah was assassinated, for Hoshea assassinated him, and the ten tribes fell into the hands of Sennacherib; and Shebna went out of Jerusalem when Sennacherib abandoned it to march on Tirhakah, king of Cush. He took along Shebna and his company and went away.
@16
<b>Bind this warning</b> All this is part of the prophecy stated above (v. 11): “For so has the Lord said to me,” and He said further to me, “Bind this warning (תְּעוּדָה),” an expression similar to (Deut. 8: 19): “I warn (הַעִדֹּתִי) you today,” an expression of warning. Bind My warning and seal the Torah on the heart of My disciples. Your disciples who fear My Name are called “disciples of the Lord.” And if you say that the expression of binding does not apply to the study of the Torah, it does indeed apply, as it is said (Prov. 6:21): “Bind them upon your heart always.”
@17
<b>And I will wait for the Lord</b> Said Isaiah: I wait for the Lord, Who hides His countenance from the ten tribes. I hope for Him to fulfill these my words, and to save the House of David.
@18
<b>Behold, I and the children...for signs</b> For two signs: the disaster in store for Pekah, as the child was called Maher-shalal-hash-baz, and the salvation of the House of David, as the child was called Immanuel. This is the solution of the matter according to its simple meaning. According to Midrash Aggadah in Genesis Rabbah (4:2), however, [it deals with Ahaz, who locked (lit. held, אָחַז in Heb.)] the synagogues and the study-halls, lest the children of the schools study Torah. He said, “If there are kids, there are no bucks. If there are no bucks, there are no flocks. If there are no flocks, there is no Shepherd. I will cause Him to remove His presence.” The prophet said to him: “No matter how much you bind the testimony and seal the Torah to close it up, so that it shall not be found in Israel, it shall not avail you.” [17]
<b>And I will wait for the Lord, Who hides His countenance...</b> There is no harsher prophecy than that time when Moses said (Deut. 31:18): “And I will surely hide My countenance on that day.” And even on that very day, He promised them, “And this song shall testify before him as a witness, for it shall not be forgotten from the mouth of his seed” (ibid.). [18]
<b>Behold, I and the children etc.</b> They are the disciples, who are as dear to me as children; they shall be for signs and wonders that the Torah will survive [in Israel through them].
@19
<b>And when they say to you</b> Said Rabbi Simon: Beeri, the father of Hosea son of Beeri, prophesied these two verses, but, since they were not enough for a Book, they were attached to “Isaiah.” And he prophesied them concerning the exile of the ten tribes, when Sennacherib exiled the Reubenites and the Gadites, and he exiled him with them, as it is said (I Chron. 5:6): “Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser exiled; he was the prince of the Reubenites.”
<b>And when they say to you</b> [i.e., when] the nations [say to you].
<b>Inquire of the necromancers...who chirp and who moan</b> This is a derogatory expression, for they have not even any speech, but like these birds who chirp with their voice. The expression of chirping and moaning applies to birds, as below (48:14): “Like a swift or a crane I chirp, I moan like a dove.” Similarly, we find the expression of chirping in regards to a low voice, as it is said (infra 29:4): “And your voice shall be like a necromancer from the earth, and from the dust shall your speech chirp.”
<b>Does not this people inquire of its God?</b> This shall be your reply: Does not a people like us, who has a God like our God, inquire of its God? Would you tell us to be like you, to inquire of the needs of the living from the dead?
@20
<b>For the Torah and the warning</b> This is related to the above: Shall we inquire of the dead for the Torah and for the warning for the living, to instruct us what to do? All this is according to the Midrash. According to the simple meaning, however, we can interpret: And when they say to you...This is the end of his prophecy, for he said (v. 11), “and admonished me from going in the way of this people,” and the Holy One, blessed be He, admonished the prophet and Hezekiah’s company, that when Shebna and his company, who will see Hezekiah condemning idolatry, say to you, Inquire of the necromancers and those who divine by the Jidoa bone, and select idolatry as the early forefathers did, and switch the kingdom over to Sennacherib. Does not every people inquire of its god, they worship idols and inquire for the living of the dead? You too should do this.
<b>for the Torah and for the warning</b> This shall be your reply, that you shall observe the Torah, as it is said above, “Bind the warning, seal the Torah, and do not believe their words.”
<b>if they will not say the likes of this that it has no light</b> Heb. אֵין לוֹ שַׁחַר. Since you will reply to him [to themms.] this answer, you will see and hear whether the honest people among them will not concur with your statement, and say, The likes of this thing is true, that the god, the necromancer, and the diviner by the Jidoa bone, have no request”; i. e., it is not proper to request of him, [explaining שַׁחַר as “request.”] In this manner, Jonathan rendered it. The Midrash Aggadah (Lev. Rabbah 6:6) explains: For himself, he cannot make the dawn shine, for he has no eyes and cannot see. How can he make it shine upon others? Another explanation is:
<b>If they do not say to you the likes of this thing</b> Now you will see whether they will not say the likes of this thing, namely, “Inquire of the necromancers and of those who divine by the Jidoa bone.” Even though there is no “light” and no substance in this thing, they will not be ashamed.
@21
<b>And the one who passes therein shall suffer hardships and hunger</b> This refers to the above. What is mentioned at the beginning of the section? “And He admonished me from going in the way of this people.” And he explained what that way is, viz. “You shall not call a band...” the union of the ten tribes, who will unite with the kings of Egypt, and he delineated their punishment: “And it shall be for a portent, and they shall stumble on them,” and the entire section.
<b>and shall pass therein</b> [i.e.,] the one who passes on that way in abandoning the Holy One, blessed be He and relying upon the kings of Egypt.
<b>shall suffer hardships</b> Difficult circumstances.
<b>He shall be wearied by hardships and hunger</b> For the harshness of the siege and the oppression shall come upon them during the siege, the three years that Sennacherib besieged Samaria.
<b>and it shall come to pass, when he is hungry and wroth, he shall curse</b> the calves and the baalim that they worshipped.
<b>and he will turn to Heaven</b> to beseech the Holy One, blessed be He, and He will not listen, for the verdict will have been sealed. Jonathan, too, rendered it in this manner.
@22
<b>And he shall look to the land</b> perhaps he will find aid. [This refers to the incident] that Hoshea son of Elah sent messengers to So the king of Egypt (II Kings 17:4).
<b>and behold distress</b> For they will not aid him, and also Shebna defected to Sennacherib, to his detriment.
<b>weariness of oppression</b> Heb. מְעוּף צוּקָה, weariness of oppression.
<b>and to the darkness he is lost</b> And through the darkness he is lost, for the expression of נִדּוּחַ [applies to darkness], as (Jer. 23:12): “Therefore, their way shall be to them like slippery land in the darkness; they shall be lost and fall upon it.” And to the darkness they shall be lost.
@23
<b>For there is no weariness for the one who oppresses her</b> For the king of Assyria, who was given the mission to oppress and to besiege her and their land [(var.) your land], is neither weary nor slothful to come upon them as many as three times: one in the days of Pekah, when he took Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah,... and Kedesh,...and Galilee, the entire land of Naphtali (II Kings 15:29). And that exile took place in the fourth year of Ahaz, and in the twelfth year, “the Lord incited Pul, the king of Assyria... and exiled the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.” This verse is in Chronicles (I 5:26). This exile took place in the twelfth year of Ahaz, at the beginning of Hoshea’s revolt, as is stated (II Kings 17:4): “And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea,” after he had subordinated himself to him for eight years. Although the calculation is not explicit in the Bible, it is, nevertheless, possible to deduce it from the Baraitha of Seder Olam (Ch. 22). The third exile took place in the sixth year of Hezekiah, the ninth year of Hoshea’s revolt, when Samaria that is the capitalwas captured, and everyone was exiled. That is what is stated here, for there is no weariness for the adversary, who will oppress her, [i.e.,] the land of Israel mentioned in the passage, “And he shall look to the land.”
<b>like the first time, he dealt mildly, [exiling only] the land of Zebulun</b> This middle exile will be like the one of the first time, when he dealt mildly to exile the land of Zebulun and Naphtali, for also in the second one, he exiled but the two and a half tribes who were on the other side of the Jordan, but the last one was the third removal.
<b>he dealt harshly</b> Heb. הכביד. He swept (מכבד) everything away, like one who sweeps (מְכַבֵּד) a house. This can also be interpreted as an expression of harshness according to the context of the verse, which commences first with an expression of “dealt mildly, [exiling only] the land of Zebulun,” he said, “He dealt harshly.” When Isaiah said this prophecy, the first ones had already been exiled.
<b>the way of the sea</b> [Those dwelling by the Sea of Tiberias] (Kinnereth): that is the land of Naphtali, concerning whom it was said (Deut. 33:23): “The sea and the southland you shall inherit.”
<b>the other side of the Jordan</b> That is the second exile, that of Reuben and Gad.
<b>the attraction of the nations</b> Heb. (גְּלִיל הַגּוֹיִם). That is the entire land of Israel, which would roll (גּוֹלֶלֶת) to it all the nations, for all longed for it and came to it for commerce, like the matter that is stated (Jer. 3:19): “A heritage desired by hosts of nations.” Jonathan, however, rendered this differently.

<b>You have aggrandized this nation</b> They have become aggrandized to all who hear of them, when the nations heard the miracles that were performed for them.
<b>You have magnified the joy for them</b> Heb. לוֹ, [lit. for him.] And not for his enemies. It is written לֹא, [spelled ‘lammed aleph,’ meaning ‘not,’] since Hezekiah’s joy was incomplete, because, at that time it was said to him (infra 39:6), everything in your palace...will be carried off to Babylonia.”
<b>like the joy of harvest</b> Jonathan renders: like the joy of the victors of a battle, which is similar to the harvest; those who slay men cut throats. Scripture deviated from being explicit [lit. changed its language] to expound that the miracle took place on the night of the harvest of the omer.
<b>as they rejoice when they divide spoils</b> of Egypt in Moses’ time, for here, too, they divided the spoils of Cush and Egypt and the coveted treasures of all the nations, for, when he returned from Tirhakah, king of Cush, he came to Jerusalem with all the treasures of Cush and Egypt, as it is stated (infra 45:14): “The toil of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush and the Sebaites...” And all this Hezekiah and his people plundered.

@4
<b>For, every victory shout sounds with clamor</b> Heb. כִּי כָל-סְאוֹן סֹאֵן בְרַעַשׁ. Some (Machbereth Menachem, p. 125, who claims that the root is סא interpret this as an expression of a ‘seah’ and a measure, as our Rabbis expounded it (Sotah 8b, Tosefta 3:1, Mid. Psalms 91:2, [where the Rabbis interpret this passage to mean that a person is rewarded with the same measure he metes out to others]), but, according to the simple interpretation of the language of the Scriptures, it is impossible to explain it as an expression [of a ‘seah,’] since the ‘vav’ and the ‘nun’ are not radicals but like שָׁאוֹן from שׁוֹאֶה, and הָמוֹן from הוֹמֶה, and חָרוֹן from חָרָה, this root will not assume a verb form with a ‘nun’ to say סוֹאֵן, but סוֹאֶה, just as from הָמוֹן, we say הוֹמֶה, and from שָׁאוֹן, שׁוֹאֶה, but one does not say: שׁוֹאֵן, הוֹמֵן, חוֹרֵן. I [therefore,] say that its interpretation is according to the context, and that it is hapax legomenon in Scripture. Its interpretation is an expression of a shout of victory in battle. [We, therefore, explain the words: כִּי כָל-סְאוֹן סֹאֵן בְרַעַשׁ as follows:] The sound of [var. every] victory of any victor in war, is with clamor; it is the galloping of horses and the striking of shields against each other. And the garments of those killed in battle wallowing in blood. But in this victory there is no clamor, and there is no blood.

<b>For a child has been born to us</b> Although Ahaz is wicked, his son who was born to him many years ago [nine years prior to his assuming the throne] to be our king in his stead, shall be a righteous man, and the authority of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His yoke shall be on his shoulder, for he shall engage in the Torah and observe the commandments, and he shall bend his shoulder to bear the burden of the Holy One, blessed be He.

@6
<b>To him who increased the authority</b> To whom will He call this name? To the king who increases the authority of the Holy One, blessed be He, upon himself, to fear Him.
<b>authority</b> an expression of government. [This is to refute those who disagree with us [the Christians]. But it is possible to say that “Prince of Peace,” too, is one of the names of the Holy One, blessed be He, and this calling of a name is not actually a name but an expression of (var. for the purpose of) greatness and authority. Comp. (Ruth 4:11) “And be famous (וּקְרָא שֵׁם) in Bethlehem. Also (II Sam. 7:9, I Chron. 17:8): “And I shall make for you a name.” Here too, Scripture means, “And He gave him a name and authority.”]
<b>and for peace</b> which is given to him, there will be no end, for he had peace on all his sides, and this “end” is not an expression of an end to eternity, but there will be no boundaries. On the throne of the kingdom of David shall this peace be justice and righteousness that Hezekiah performed.
<b>and for peace</b> Heb. וּלְשָׁלוֹם. This ‘vav’ is to rectify the word, thus: He [Hezekiah] increased the authority upon his shoulder, and what reward will He [God] pay him? Behold, his peace shall have no end or any limit.
<b>from now and to eternity</b> The eternity of Hezekiah, viz. all his days. And so we find that Hannah said concerning Samuel (I Sam. 1:22): “and abide there forever.” And, in order to refute those who disagree [i.e., the Christians, who claim that this (Prince of Peace) is their deity], we can refute them [by asking], What is the meaning of: “from now”? Is it not so that the “deity” did not come until after five hundred years and more?
<b>the zeal of the Lord of Hosts</b> Who was zealous for Zion concerning what Aram and Pekah planned about it.

Said the ministering angels before the Holy One, blessed be He, Should the one who stripped the doors of the Temple and sent them to the king of Assyria, be made Messiah?

It may alternatively be explained: With a rod does he smite you[i.e.,] who has smitten you until now with a rod and has become accustomed to bearing his staff and his fright over you as the Egyptians did. Rabbi Joseph told me this in the name of Rabbi Menahem.

Our Rabbis, however, explained [that Sennacherib’s yoke would be destroyed] because of Hezekiah’s oil which burnt in the synagogues and in the study-halls, for he persuaded them to engage in Torah, after the matter that is written (Proverbs 25: 1): “Which the men of Hezekiah strengthened.”

<b>with a saw</b> Heb. בְּמַעֲרָצָה, with a saw that cuts the boughs. This [word פֻּארָה] is not an expression denoting a winepress, for it is not spelled with a ‘vav,’ like (infra 63: 3) “A winepress (פּוּרָה) I trod,” and like (Haggai 2:16) “To draw off fifty measures from the winepress (פּוּרָה),” but with an ‘aleph,’ like (Ezekiel 31:5) “And its boughs became long (פֹּארֹתָיו).” מְסָעֵף is an expression of cutting off branches [esbranchier in O.F.], like (infra 27:10) “And he will destroy its branches (סְעִיפֶיהָ), and (infra 17:6) “On its branches (בִּסְעִיפֶיהָ) the fruitful one.”

@34

From then on, it cannot be charmed; as it is said (Psalms 58:6): “Who will not hearken to the voice of charmers.”
<b>and over the eyeball of a venomous snake</b> Jonathan renders: the eyeballs of venomous snakes [מְאוּרַת from אוֹר, light]. Menahem (Machbereth Menachem p. 32) interpreted it as an expression of a hole, namely holes in the ground. Comp. (Gen. 11:28) “The valley of the Chaldees (אוּר)”; (infra 24:15) “In the valleys (בָּאוּרִים) honor the Lord.”
<b>a weaned child</b> a child weaned from his mother’s breasts.

(Ezekiel 7:7) “The joyful call (הֵד) of the mountains, also (infra 16: 9) “The cry (הֵידָד),” which is an expression of raising the voice. This, too, is an expression of raising, and the final [letter] ‘heh’ appears in it as a radical which sometimes falls out, like עָשָׂה (made), בָּנָה (built), קָנָה (acquired).

Israel will fly and run of one accord against the Philistines who are in the west of Eretz Israel and conquer their land. [כָּתֵף, lit. a shoulder, is used in this case to denote unity. The word שֶׁכֶם, also lit. a shoulder, is used in a similar sense.] Comp. (Hoshea 6:9) “They murder on the way in unison (שֶׁכְמָה)”; (Zeph. 3:9) “One accord (שְׁכֶם אֶחָד).” And so did Jonathan render it: And they shall join in one accord to smite the Philistines who are in the west.

May Your wrath turn away and may You comfort me. Jonathan renders: I will confess before You, O Lord, that I sinned before You, and, therefore, You were wroth with me, and were it not for Your mercy, I would not be worthy to have Your wrath turn away and comfort me, and behold, Your wrath has turned away from me.

<b>for the strength and the praise of the Eternal the Lord</b> The strength and the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, that was my salvation. We cannot, however, explain עָזִּי, like עֻזִּי, my strength, for we do not find in Scripture עָזִּי vowelized with a short ‘kamatz,’ but with a ‘shuruk,’ reading עֻזִּי, with the exception of three places where it is accompanied by וְזִמְרָת. Also, וְזִמְרָת cannot be explained like וְזִמְרָתִי, my praise, but we are forced to say that וְזִמְרָת is connected to the word following it. Therefore, I say that the ‘yud’ of עָזִּי is merely like the ‘yud’ of (Deut. 33:16) שׁוֹכְנִי סְנֶה, “He Who dwells in the thornbush.”
<b>the Eternal the Lord</b> Until now His Name was divided, and with the downfall of Amalek, it became whole, and so Scripture states (Exodus 17:16): “For the hand is on the throne of the Eternal (כֵּס יָהּ),” implying that the throne is incomplete and the Name is incomplete until the Lord wages war against Amalek.
<b>was my salvation.</b> Heb. וַיְהִי לִי לִישׁוּעָה, like הָיָה לִי לִישׁוּעָה, was to me for a salvation, and it is customary for Scripture to speak in this manner. Comp. (Exodus 9:21) “And he who did not heed the word of the Lord, left (וַיַּעֲזֹב) his slaves and his cattle”; also, in II Chronicles (10:17): “And the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned (וַיִּמְלֹךְ) over them.” It should say, מָלַךְ עֲלֵיהֶם.

It is also possible to interpret, הֶמְיַתנְבָלֶיךָ as, the stirring of the wanton ones, who commit wanton acts, of your armies, and it seems to me that in the great Masorah, this was combined with (Amos 5:21) “The song of your psalteries,” in the aleph-beth of two meanings.

When he died, they took Evil-Merodach out of prison to crown him king, but he did not accept it upon himself. He said, If he returns to his kingdom, he will kill me. They said to him, He is dead and buried. But he did not believe them until they took him out of his grave and dragged him.

In contrast with what he said before (verse 17): “Who made the land like a desert and demolished his cities,” he says further: His seed shall perish, and the inhabitants of the cities shall return to their place, and the surface of the earth shall be filled with cities.

<b>that the rod that smote you has been broken</b> that the kingdom of the House of David, which was wont to smite you, has been weakened and humbled, as we find concerning David, and so, concerning Uzziah, king of Judah, who smote you, as the matter is stated (II Chron. 26:6): “And he went out and fought against the Philistines and breached the wall of Gath.”
<b>for, from the root of a snake</b> From the root of that snake, shall emanate a venomous serpent, which is more formidable than a snake. Now who was this? This was Hezekiah, concerning whom it is stated (II Kings 18:8): “He slew the Philistines up to Gaza and its boundaries, from watchtower to fortified city.”

@30
<b>And the first born of the poor shall graze</b> In his days, the princes of Israel, who are now poor because of you, shall graze. “Firstborn,” is an expression of princes. Comp. (Ps. 89:28) “Also, I will appoint him My firstborn.”
@31
<b>for from the North smoke has come</b> Retribution harsh as smoke shall come upon them from the north. Gaza and its boundaries, which Hezekiah smote, were in the south of Eretz Israel in the southwestern corner. Eretz Israel is found to be north of it. And so we find in Sifrei in Ha’azinu 322: They attempted to flee through the south, and they turned them over, as it is stated (Amos 1:6): “For three transgressions of Gaza... [because of their exiling a complete exile to deliver to Edom.]” Hence, we learn that Gaza is on the south.
<b>and there is no straggler in his ranks</b> Jonathan renders: And there is no straggler among his appointed ones, i.e., in his ranks whom he appointed to come upon them, and no one delays his steps to be secluded and to come in seclusion alone, but all of them shall come as one, with strength.
@32
<b>And what shall the messengers of a nation announce</b> What shall the messengers of Israel, who go to bring news, announce in the days of Hezekiah? This is what they shall announce: The Lord has founded in Zion; He has set up therein a fitting and powerful king; the Lord is with him.

For the entire strength of Moab shall my heart cry, as far as Zoar, which is a third born heifer; it is their main strength, like a heifer born third to its mother. Alternatively, שְׁלִשִׁיָּה means a strong heifer. Jonathan, however, renders בְּרִיחֶיהָ like בּוֹרְחֶיהָ, those of her who flee. Those who flee shall flee from them to escape to Zoar, as Lot, their forebear, fled to Zoar.
<b>the ascent of Haluhith</b> A place on the ascents of the mountain, named “the ascent of Haluhith,” and similarly (Jer. 48:5), “The descent of Horonaim.” Those who flee through them shall weep. All these locations are from Moab.
<b>they shall raise</b> Heb. יְעֹעֵרוּ, they shall cry, and this is an Aramaic expression, for Jonathan renders (infra 16:10): “The treader shall not tread; I have abolished the cry,” as: “They shall not cry (יְעוֹעֲרוּן) with their voice.”
@6

<b>for the grass has dried up</b> meaning their heroes and their kings and their rulers, and since the land of Moab is noted for its good pastureland, as we learned (Menachoth 87a): “Rams from Moab,” he therefore compared its retribution to the destruction of its pastureland.
@7
<b>Because of the many things they did</b> Because they did many things, this retribution shall come upon them, for they were unappreciative, for in many places Abraham stood up for Lot: when he left Haran, and when he went to Egypt, and in his merit he was sent out of the overturning of Sodom, and he fought for him with Amraphel and his allies. For this, they should have repaid his descendants with favors. Yet they taunted them when Sennacherib exiled the Reubenites and the Gadites, and the Israelites were weeping and lamenting, and they would say to them, ‘Why are you lamenting? Aren’t you going to your father’s house? Didn’t your father Abraham come from the other side of the river?’ And this is what is stated (Zephaniah 2:8): “I heard the insults of Moab and the jeers of the children of Ammon.” Moreover, they aided Sennacherib for three years when he besieged Samaria. This is what is stated (infra 16:14): “In three years, like the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be debased.”
<b>and their appointed territory</b> Heb. וּפְקֻדָּתָם. Jonathan renders: and their boundaries that are on the western sea, shall be taken. This is an expression of appointment. Comp. (Num. 4:16) “And the appointment of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest.” The land over which they were appointed, shall be taken from them.
<b>by the western sea, they shall take them</b> The enemies shall take them, namely the boundaries. Alternatively, it may be interpreted as: and their visitation; i.e., their visitation that I will bring upon them will be, that to the valley of the willows they shall carry them off. The enemies shall exile them to the land of Babylon, which is the valley of the willows, as it is said (Ps. 137:2): “On willows in its midst we hung our harps.”

Jonathan renders, however: כְּנִישַׁתמַשַׁירְיָן, the gathering of the camps, the camps joined together. This is an expression of (infra 21:1) “Join (סְפוּ) year to year”; (Deut. 29:18) “to add (סְפוֹת) the inadvertent sins.”

Now if you ask, All these are cities of the east side of the Jordan, and Israel took them from the hands of Sihon. Now when did they return to the hands of Moab? When Sennacherib exiled the Reubenites and the Gadites, the neighboring Moabites came and settled in them.

<b>I will be sated over you with my tears</b> Heb. אַרְיָוֶךְ, I will be sated over you. There are some words that serve as two words. Comp.

<b>In three years like the years of a hireling</b> Because of three years that they aided Sennacherib when he besieged Samaria, and they aided him without compensation, as though they were his hirelings, the glory of Moab shall, therefore, be debased among the rest of Sennacherib’s multitudes, for he swept them away into captivity from the midst of that army and went away. And so it is related in Seder Olam (ch. 23): He swept away the Ammonites and the Moabites who aided him when he besieged Samaria three years, to fulfill what is said: “Three years like the years of a hireling, etc.” It can further be explained as follows: “Three years like the years of a hireling.” Three years were decreed upon you as a reprieve, but they will be exact, and the retribution will not be delayed further, as a hireling is exact with the years of his hire, to limit them.

<b>The cities of Aroer are abandoned</b> Jonathan renders this as an expression of destruction. Comp. (Jer. 51:58) “shall be destroyed (עַרְעֵר תִּתְעַרְעַר), and he explained it in reference to the cities of Aram, i. e., Jonathan renders it: Their cities are abandoned, they are destroyed. The Midrash Aggadah (introduction to Lam. Rabbah 10 [with variations], Yalkut Machin) asks in amazement, since Aroer was [part] of Eretz Israel, as it is said (Num. 32:34): “and Aroer.” He is dealing with Damascus and he announces matters concerning Aroer? But, since in Damascus there were streets as numerous as the days of the solar year, and in each one was a pagan deity, which they would worship one day in the year, and the Israelites made them all into one group and worshipped all of them every day, he, therefore, mentioned the downfall of Aroer juxtaposed to Damascus. I explain it, however, according to the simple meaning of the verse, as follows: Since Rezin and Pekah son of Remaliah joined together, and the prophet prophesying about the downfall of Damascus, and saying, “Behold, Damascus shall be removed from [being] a city,” and the cities of Aroer which belonged to Pekah were already abandoned, for the Reubenites and the Gadites had already been exiled, and they were always given to the flocks of sheep, and the sheep of Moab would lie there undisturbed, he continues to say that the kingdom of Pekah shall continue to be gradually terminated, and that Samaria, too, shall be captured in the days of Hoshea, and then (v. 3) And a fortress shall cease from Ephraim and a kingdom from Damascusfor Rezin shall be killed.

That is to say that even those who flee will not escape his hand, and they will gather them [var. and he will gather them] [like one who gathers ears].

That is what Ezekiel said to them (20:5): “On the day I chose Israel, and I lifted My hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and I became known to them in the land of Egypt.” And it says further (verse 8): “And they rebelled against Me and they refused to obey...” Here, too, תְּשַׂגְשֵׂנִי, you became mingled with the abominations of Egypt.
<b>and in the morning you cause your seed to blossom</b> And on the morrow, when I took you out of there, and I brought you into the land, there, too, your evil seed you caused to blossom.
<b>a heap of harvest on a day of sickness</b> a heap of bad harvest that lies by day and by night, that harvest is stricken ill, it has reached a day of distress. [Rashi in printed editions.] [Since it is difficult to make sense of this comment of Rashi, Parshandatha prefers the reading of most mss.:]
<b>a heap of harvest on a day of sickness</b> a heap of bad harvest, as “on a day of sickness” proves, that harvest reached a day of distress.
<b>a heap</b> Heb. נֵד. This is an expression of a tall heap. Comp. (Exodus 15:8) “Running water stood erect like a heap (נֵד).” Also (Ps. 33:3), “He gathers like a heap (כַּנֵּד).” [The words:] נֵד and נוֹד are not the same [i.e., נֵד is a heap or a stack, and נוֹד is a flask.]
<b>and mortal pain</b> that you were paid your reward.
<b>mortal</b> Heb. אָנוּשׁ, distressed by severe illness. Comp. (II Sam. 12: 15) “And he became mortally ill (וַיֵּאָנַשׁ),” also (Micah 1:9), “For her wounds are mortal (אֲנוּשָׁה) .” Alternatively
<b>and in the morning you cause your seed to blossom</b> Before the heat comes, you have blossomed, and it is customary for the vineyard to blossom when the heat comes, and the one that blossoms in the morning does not thrive. This is in the Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (Sh’lach 12).

<b>Woe to a multitude of many peoples</b> This is a principle followed throughout all generations; the scourge by which Israel is punished, shall eventually suffer.

<b>and like the thistle blossoms</b> Heb. וּכְגַלְגַל. That is from the blossom of the thistles called kardouns in O.F. [chardons in modern French] similar to those with which they pull woolen garments, and they are not hard. When the end of the summer arrives, they burst open by themselves and the wind scatters them. Now that bursting is made like a round wheel (גַלְגַּל) [var. like a wagon wheel], like a sort of eye in the center with five spokes around it.

I say, however, that because they live in the east, and the land is hot, birds assemble there, and it is shaded by the birds’ wings.

<b>and the idols of Egypt shall quake from before Him</b> They will have no power to save their people from the messengers of the king of Assyria. The prophet presented the retribution of Egypt in this manner, unlike the way he presented it to other nations, because they are accustomed to being punished in this manner. (Exodus 12:12) “And I will pass through the land of Egypt...and upon all the gods of Egypt [will I execute punishment],” and it is customary to frighten a person with a misfortune from which he has already suffered.

<b>into the hands of a harsh master</b> Heb. אֲדֹנִים קָשֶׁה. Any expression of lordship is used in the plural, even for a singular. Comp. (ibid. 39:20) “Joseph’s master (אֲדֹנֵי)”; (ibid. 16) “Until his master (אֲדֹנָיו) came.”

@5
<b>And water from the sea shall dry up</b> Heb. וְנִשְּׁתוּ, an expression like (Lam. 3:47): “The desolation (הַשְׁאֵת) and the breach.” Since the entire productivity of Egypt is due to the Nile, since no rain falls there, but the Nile rises and waters it through its man made canals, he, therefore, compares its retribution to the drying up of canals. [Some manuscripts read:] Rivers and canals.
<b>And water from the sea shall dry up</b> And the sea shall not return the Nile to its source, but the Nile will descend into it and will not ascend to water Egypt.
<b>and the river</b> This is the Nile.
@6
<b>And they shall abandon</b> When the water decreases, the mud is noticeable in it, and it becomes a mire and is abandoned.
<b>the deep canals</b> Heb. יְאֹרֵי מָצוֹר. The deep canals, like the ditches of the sieges of cities. [Rashi according to Parshandatha. Printed editions read:] In the ditches of the sieges of cities.
<b>reeds and rushes</b> that grew there because of their abundant water.
<b>shall be cut off</b> When the canals dry up, the reeds stop growing, and they dry up and fall. Jonathan renders: Shall not come up. Elsewhere (infra 33:9), he renders: “The Lebanon was dried up, cut off (קָמַל),” as ‘fell.’ I say, however, that it is an expression of cutting off, that they are cut off by themselves because of their dryness, and they fall.
@7
<b>The well-rooted plants by the stream, by the brink of the stream</b> Heb. עָרוֹת, an expression denoting something rooted very well. Comp. (Psalms 37:35) “The wicked, terrible in power, striking roots (מִתְעָרֶה) like a green tree in its native soil.” Menachem, too, equated it in this manner in his lexicon. [Menachem, however, explains both terms as an expression of growing and of freshness.] Seeds, well-rooted by the Nile, and even on its brink, and all those planted thereby, everything shall dry up and be driven away.
@8
<b>And...shall lament</b> Heb. וְאָנוּ, an expression of lamentation and mourning.
<b>the fishermen</b> They are the Egyptians who catch fish from the Nile, which spreads and goes up into many canals made on its banks over the surface of all the land of Egypt, unlike other rivers.
<b>fishhooks</b> ajjm in O.F.
@9
<b>Those who work at flax</b> Who sow flax by the river.
<b>to be combed</b> Flax that they comb and from which they weave fish nets, which are made with many holes.
<b>nets</b> [lit. holes.] Since the suffix is irregular, ordinarily חוֹרִים Rashi enumerates similar instances e.g.,] (Psalms 8:5) “The beasts of the field (שָׂדָי)”; (Jer. 22:14) “And he will cut out for himself windows (חַלּוֹנָי).”
@10
<b>And its foundations shall be crushed, all who make dams</b> Eklusa in O.F., a sluice. Comp. (Gen. 8:2) “And the fountains of the deep were stopped up (וַיִּסָּכְרוּ),” for they would stop up the water that went out of the banks of the river and spread out, forming a pond of still water, standing in its place, where fish would spawn. The prophet says that the foundations of their diggings shall be crushed, and the dammed up pools that they made.
<b>still ponds</b> An expression like (Ex. 31:17): “He rested and was refreshed (וַיִּנָּפַשׁ),” for the water of the ponds rests and stands in one place. Jonathan, however, renders: Who would make the dams and gather the water, each one for himself.

[Other editions read:] In Draco. Alternatively, it can be interpreted like the Targum: a head and a lower dignitary, a prince and a governor.

<b>And the land of Judah shall be to Egypt for a dread</b> When those remaining in Egypt from the captivity of Sennacherib hear of his downfall, that he will fall in the land of Judah without any physical warfare, they will know that the Divine Presence is manifest in Israel and that their Savior is mighty, and they will fear and be frightened of the land of Judah.
<b>a dread</b> Heb. לְחָגָּא, an expression of a breach and fear and fright, similar to (Psalms 107:27): “They were frightened (יָחוֹגוּ) and wander like a drunkard,” similarly (Song 2:14), “In the cracks of (בְּחַגְוֵי) the rock.”
<b>because of the plan of the Lord of Hosts which he planned against him</b> to cause him to fall into the hands of Sennacherib, and Judah will escape from his hand.
@18
<b>On that day there shall be five cities, etc.</b> We learned in Seder Olam (ch. 23): Following Sennacherib’s defeat, Hezekiah stood up and released the armies he had brought with him from Egypt and from Cush in chains before Jerusalem, and they imposed upon themselves the kingdom of heaven, and returned to their place, and it is said: “On that day there shall be five cities, etc.” They went and built an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt and they would sacrifice on it to heaven, to fulfill what was said: On that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt. Some of our Sages expounded it in the tractate Menahoth (109b) as referring to the altar of the temple of Onias the son of Simon the Just, who fled to Egypt and built an altar there.
<b>speaking the language of Canaan</b> like the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
<b>one of which will be called “the city of Heres.”</b> Jonathan paraphrases: The city of Beth-shemesh which is destined to be destroyed will be said to be one of them. Jonathan renders “Heres” in two ways: an expression related to (Job 9:7) “Who says to the sun (לַחֶרֶס) and it will not shine,” [הֶרֶס and חֶרֶס being interchangeable since ‘heh’ and ‘heth’ are both gutterals,] and an expression of demolition and destruction. (Some editions add:) And whence did Jonathan derive this? From Jeremiah’s prophecy, which he prophesied in Tahpanhes (43:13): “He shall also break the monuments of Beth shemesh which is in the land of Egypt.” We learn from here that Beth-shemesh that was in the land of Egypt [and the monument] was destined to be destroyed, and the monuments mentioned there are identical with “the monument beside its border, to the Lord,” mentioned here, and it may be said that Beth-shemesh was situated in the border of Egypt on the boundary. Therefore it is stated: Beside its border.

@24
<b>Israel shall be a third to Egypt and to Assyria</b> for a blessing, since there was no prominent nation in the world at that time like Egypt and like Assyria, and the Jews were humble in the days of Ahaz and in the days of Hoshea the son of Elah. And the prophet states that, through the miracle that will be performed for Hezekiah, Israel’s name will be greatly magnified, and they will be as prominent as one of these kingdoms in regards to blessing and greatness.
@25

#20
@2
<b>and you shall gird sackcloth over your loins</b> (וּפִתַּחְתָּ) Jonathan renders: “And you shall gird the sackcloth over your loins.” And his interpretation is evidenced by the fact that until now, He had not commanded him to gird himself with sackcloth, that He should tell him to remove it. Moreover, when He tells him, “And you shall remove your shoes from upon your feet,” this is a sign of mourning. (It is, therefore, likely that He commanded him to gird himself with sackcloth, also a sign of mourning.) And the meaning of וּפִתַּחְתָּ is like: (Exodus 39:6) “Engraved like the engravings of a seal (מְפֻתָּחוֹת פִּתּוּחֵי חוֹתָם),” to gird himself with sackcloth tightly on his flesh, so that it appears to be engraved in his flesh.
<b>over your loins</b> above your loins. naked (עָרוֹם). Jonathan renders: פְּחֵיחַ, with torn and worn out clothing, but not actually naked.

<b>three years</b> shall he go in this manner as a sign and a symbol for Egypt and for Cush, that, at the end of three years the king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt...

<b>The harsh prophecy of the western desert</b> This prophecy refers to Babylonia, as is delineated therein. If you ask, Did he not already prophesy about it (supra 13): “On a tranquil mountain raise a banner,” and the entire chapter? sometimes the prophecy comes into his mouth today in one manner, and later in another manner.
<b>The harsh prophecy of the western desert</b> Jonathan paraphrases: A harsh prophecy concerning the armies that come from the desert, as numerous as the waters of the sea.
<b>like tempests in arid land, to pass</b> Like a tempest that whirls in an arid land, that raises much dust.
<b>to pass</b> So will many camps pass to come upon Babylon.
<b>from the desert</b> they shall come to them (lit.. to her).
<b>from an awesome land</b> Jonathan renders: From a land where mighty deeds have been performed. It is also possible to explain that it is a place of snakes and scorpions, as it is said (Deut. 8: 15): “The great and awesome desert.”
@2
<b>A harsh prophecy</b> The prophet says, “This harsh prophecy concerning Babylon was told to me.”
<b>the traitor shall be betrayed</b> Jonathan renders: The robbers are robbed and the plunderers are plundered. The Hebrew wording, according to the Targum, is to be explained thus: The traitor another will come and betray him; and the plunderer another will come and plunder him. These are Persia and Media, who rob and plunder Babylon, who, until now plundered and robbed all the countries.
<b>march, Elam</b> and come upon them (lit., her). besiege, O Media (צוּרִי). I.e., besiege Babylon with a siege. Comp. (II Sam. 22:3) “God is my rock (צוּרִי).” The accent is on the latter syllable, on the “resh,” whereas, in this case, the accent is on the first syllable, like “rise (קוּמִי),” “return (שׁוּבִי).” all sighs have I brought to an end (אַנְחָתָה). (This is) not (spelled with a) “Mappiq heh,” (which would mean “her sigh”) for this is like “all sighs in the world,” and it is an expression denoting a great sigh of many people (sospiradic in O.F.). All sighs have I brought to an end, for the world was sighing because of the yoke of the kingdom of Babylon; now I have brought it to an end.
@3
<b>my loins are filled with trembling</b> The prophet is merciful and sighs over the retribution meted out to the nations. This is the Midrash Aggadah (Tan., beginning of Balak).

And our Rabbis said: A woman has doors and hinges (צִירִים) on her womb just as the doors of a house have hinges (Bechoroth 45a).

Another explanation of “Toward the thirsty they bring water,” is as follows: I did not do so to your forefather, Ishmael; when he was thirsty, I revealed to him a well of water.

All letters whose sources are close to being from one place, (i.e., from one speech organ,) are interchangeable with one another, the ‘nun’ with the ‘lamed,’ as in the case stated (in Nehemiah 13: 7): “To make him a chamber (נִשְׁכָּה),” like לִשְׁכָּה.

(above 19:7) “The well rooted plants (עָרוֹת) by the stream,” (Psalms 37:35) “Striking roots (מִתְעָרֶה) like a green tree in its native soil.” It is also possible to explain: וְקִיר עֵרָה מָגֵן as follows: Kir is the name of the city. Comp. (II Kings 16:9) “And exiled [its inhabitants] to Kir.” The people of that province exposed their shields toward Jerusalem.

(I Kings 1:2): “And she shall be to him a warmer (סוֹכֶנֶת),” (San. 26b, where Rashi cites exegetes who claim that Shebna had homosexual tendencies.) Midrash Aggadah states: He was from Sichni, and he came to Jerusalem. This is in Lev. Rabbah (5:5).
<b>appointed over the Temple</b> (lit., the house.) He was appointed over the entire Temple. Some say he was the High Priest and some say he was a Temple trustee.
@16
<b>What have you here</b> Scripture denigrates him because he wished to surrender Hezekiah to the king of Assyria, as is stated in San. (26a): He wrote a note and shot it on an arrow, “Shebna and his company wish to make peace; Hezekiah and his company do not wish to make peace.”
<b>and whom do you have here</b> Who of your family is buried here?
<b>he hews his grave on high</b> For he hewed a grave for himself among the graves of the House of David, to be buried among the kings. Therefore, he says to him, “What right of heritage do you have in these graves?”
<b>he hews</b> (חֹצְבִי). The ‘yud’ is superfluous. Comp. (Deut. 33:16): “Who dwells (שׁוֹכְנִי) in the thornbush”; (Psalms 113:7) “He raises up (מְקִימִי) the poor man from the dust.”
@17
<b>Shall cast you about with a mighty toss</b> (גָבֶר) like a rooster that wanders from place to place (Lev. Rabbah ibid.) The Midrash explains גֶבֶר as a rooster. Our Rabbis, however, stated that the wandering of a man is more trying than that of a woman (San. 26a).
<b>and cause you to fly.</b> Heb. (וְעֹטְךָ עָטֹה). Comp. (I Sam. 25:14) “And he drove them away (וַיָּעַט),” an expression of עַיִּט, a bird. He will make you fly away like a bird, in exile. Our Rabbis, however, stated that ‘zaraath’ broke out upon him, as is stated: (Leviticus 13:45) “And on his upper lip he shall enwrap himself (יַעְטֶה).”
@18
<b>He shall wind you around</b> like a turban that surrounds the head, the enemies and oppressors shall surround you. like a surrounding wall. (כַּדּוּר). Our Rabbis, however, explained it as an expression of a ball, which they call ‘pelote’ in French, which is tossed and caught from hand to hand.

(26b). When Sennacherib went to Tirhakah, king of Cush, he swept away Shebna and his company and went away. We learned this in Seder Olam (ch. 23).

@23
<b>And I will thrust him like a peg in a sure place</b> (Jonathan renders:) And I will appoint him a faithful trustee, serving in a sure place. Jonathan renders נֶאֱמָן as sure, i.e., a place that is faithful to those who lean on it, for it shall not move. Another explanation is to reverse the word order of the verse: And I will thrust him a sure peg in a place.
@24
<b>the children and the grandchildren</b> (צֶאֱצָאִים וּצְפִיעוֹת). Jonathan renders: the children and the children’s children. Menachem (Machbereth p. 151) associates it with, (Ezekiel 4:15) “Cattle dung (צְפִיעֵי).” This teaches us that it is an expression of tiny infants that issue forth from their mother’s womb. making צְפִיעוֹת an expression of coming out, i.e., a thing that comes out.
<b>all the small vessels</b> the smallest of their families shall take pride in him and rely on him.
<b>from the vessels of basins to the vessels of the lyres</b> Jonathan paraphrases: From the priests who wear the ephod to the Levites who hold the lyres. Accordingly, it is an expression of the ministration vessels with which the priests perform the service in the Temple.
<b>the lyres</b> with which the Levites recite the song during the offering of the sacrifices.
@25
<b>shall the peg...move</b> (This alludes to) the greatness of Shebna.
<b>and the burden which is upon it shall be cut off</b> His family members and his company who depend on him and who hang upon him the vessels of their glory.

<b>from the land of Kittim</b> They are the Romans.
<b>he appeared to them</b> The marauder appeared to the people of Tyre. Another explanation is that from the land of Kittim, the plunder of Tyre was revealed to the people of Tarshish, for the people of Tyre fled to Kittim and from there the news was heard.

<b>Be silent, ye island dwellers</b> Mourn and sit silently, you dwellers of the island of the sea. Why? The seafaring merchants of Zidon were wont to replenish you with all merchandise. Now, when Tyre falls, Zidon will fall with it, for they were within a day’s journey from one another.
@3
<b>And on great waters</b> the seed would come from Egypt, that is situated on the river Shihor, to Tyre.
<b>the harvest of the Nile</b> Egypt was the revenue of Tyre.
<b>Shihor</b> This is the Nile, as it is said (Jos. 13: 3): “From the Shihor, which is before Egypt.” And they would bring the produce to Tyre in Egyptian ships.

<b>the mart of the nations</b> from the multitude of people that were therein. All the nations brought merchandise to her. ([Some editions read:] All the strangers.)
@4
<b>Be ashamed, Zidon</b> which was secondary to Tyre.
<b>for the sea said</b> For Tyre, that was situated in the stronghold of the sea, who was the main head of the kingdom, said, “I am as though I have not travailed, nor have I borne young men, for they all were slain, and I am as though I have not raised virgins.” And so did Jonathan render it. And our Sages said in the Aggadah: Be ashamed, Zidon, for the sea has spoken, “If I, who have no sons and daughters about whom to worry that they not be seized for my iniquity, do not deviate from the commandment of my Maker, by crossing the boundary of sand which He placed for me, how much more should you be ashamed, Zidon, since you have to worry about all these!”
@5
<b>Like the report concerning Egypt</b> which they heard about the Egyptians, that I had brought ten plagues upon them, and that they finally drowned in the sea.
<b>shall they quake</b> They shall be frightened.
<b>at the report</b> When the listeners hear that the report concerning Tyre has been announced, for also the plagues of Tyre shall be in the same pattern as those plagues: “Blood and fire” (Joel 3:3); (Isaiah 66:6) “A voice of tumult from the city,” like the croaking of the frogs, (Infra 34:9) “And its brooks shall be turned to pitch and its dust into sulphur,” on the pattern of the plague of lice. (Ibid. 11) “But the pelican and hedgehog shall take possession of it,” after the pattern of the plague of a mixture of noxious beasts. (Ezekiel 38:22) “And I will hold judgment over him with pestilence and with blood,” a pattern of the plague of murrain. (Zechariah 14:12) “His flesh shall consume away,” after the pattern of the plague of boils. (Supra 18:5) “And he shall cut off the tendrils,” after the pattern of the hail and locusts; (infra 34:6) “And a great massacre in the land of Edom,” corresponding to the plague of the first born. This system is true if his צוֹר is another city (Edom, Rome[Parshandatha]). If it is actually Tyre, because the sea inundated it, the prophet says about it, “Like the report concerning Egypt,” and I say that the entire section, indeed, is talking about Tyre, because Zidon is near it. ([Other editions read:] And I say that the entire section is, indeed, talking about Tyre. Because Zidon is near it, he juxtaposes Zidon to it [Parshandatha].)

@12

@13
<b>Behold the land of the Chaldees, this people has never been</b> It was not to be a people, for they are called, (Habakkuk 1:6) “bitter, impetuous nation.” They are a foolish nation, of the creatures that the Holy One, blessed be He, (so to speak,) regrets (creating) them. [Tractate Sukkah (52b)].

<b>destroyed its palaces</b> (עוֹרְרוּ). They shall destroy. (This is) an expression like (Psalms 137:7): “Raze it, raze it (עָרוּ עָרוּ),” an expression of demolition until the very foundation.
@15
<b>that Tyre shall be forgotten</b> Since the prophet refers to her with an expression of degradation, with an expression comparing her to a harlot, he says, “shall be forgotten,” like a harlot whose lovers have forgotten her. She, too, shall be forgotten for want of merchants and traffickers turning to her, because she shall be destroyed.
<b>like the days of one king</b> The days of David were seventy years, but I do not know why this sign is given here.
<b>it shall fare with Tyre</b> a slight remembrance, that she shall shake herself from her humble state and appeal to those who were wont to trade with her, to return to her so that she return to her original state.

<b>Behold the Lord empties the land and lays it waste</b> This prophecy represents retribution for Israel. Since he prophesied for them this consolation, and they are destined to see great distress before it, he, therefore, said to them, “Not to you do I say that you will inherit it, for, behold, the Holy One, blessed be He, empties you out and lays you waste, but those of you who survive until the day of redemption, they shall raise their voice and sing;” this is the end of the passage (v. 14), and for them have I prophesied the favorable prophecy.
<b>empties</b> (בּוֹקֵק) empties.
<b>and lays it waste</b> (וּבוֹלְקָה) and lays is waste.
<b>and He shall turn over its face</b> And He shall confuse its esteemed men. עִוָּה is an expression related to (supra 21:3): “I have become confused (נַעֲוֵיתִי) from hearing.”

<b>(Addendum) And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest</b> Not like other travelers, that the master is led by his slave, and the mistress is led by her maidservant; the master is esteemed and the slave is held in low esteem, the mistress is esteemed and the maidservant is held in low esteem, but when the captor leads the captives, all are equal before him. [Addendum to Rashi]
<b>as with the buyer, so with the seller</b> When the people lives in its land securely, the buyer is happy and the seller is unhappy, since he will not return to the land he sold, but when the captor leads them, the buyer will not rejoice and the seller will not mourn, and so, as with the lender, so with the borrower, both are equal, for the borrower has nothing to pay, and the lender, had he not lent to this one, the captor would have taken it. Likewise, as with the creditor, so with the one who owes him. The word לֹֹוֶה applies to money and נֹשֶה applies to other commodities, such as wine, oil, grain, and honey, as it is written (Deut. 24:10): “When you lend your brother anything as a loan.” [Addendum to Rashi]

<b>Therefore, for the lights</b> (בָּאֻרִים). Jonathan paraphrases: When lights come to the righteous, concerning the two good tidings, both that of the redemption from Babylon and that of Edom. ([Most manuscripts read:] Jonathan paraphrases: When lights come to the righteous, concerning the two lights, etc.) And Menachem stated (Machbereth, p. 32) that אֻרִים is an expression of holes and crevices where they were fleeing, and so (Gen. 11:28): “אוּר, the valley of the Chaldees,” and so (supra 11: 8): “And on the hole (מְאוּרַת) of an adder,” the hole of its dwelling.
@16
<b>From the end of the earth</b> Jonathan paraphrases: From the Temple, which is at the edge of the land of Israel in the east, as we learned: (Maaser Sheni 5:2) [According to Lev. 19:23 25, the produce of the vineyards produced during the first three years of its growth may neither be eaten nor may any benefit be derived therefrom. The produce of the fourth year must be taken to Jerusalem and eaten there. If this is inconvenient, the owner may redeem the produce and take the redemption money to Jerusalem, where he must buy food to eat with the sanctity of כֶּרֶם רְבָעִי, the fourth year vineyard. The Rabbis decreed, however, that within a day’s journey from Jerusalem, all produce must be brought to Jerusalem, and the owner has no option to redeem it. The following Mishnah delineates the boundaries of this area.] Lod from the west, and the Jordan from the east. It is found that from Jerusalem to the Jordan is a day’s journey. But I say according to the simple meaning, that we heard from behind the heavenly Curtain that they are destined to raise their voices in song from the edge of the earth. Now what are the songs? “The righteous shall be upraised.” There shall be a position and an upraising for the righteous.
<b>And I said, I have my secret; I have my secret; woe is to me!</b> Woe is to me that these two secrets have been revealed to me, the secret of retribution and the secret of salvation, for the salvation will be far off until enemies come, plunderers after plunderers, and marauders after marauders (San. 94a). Five instances of treachery are stated here, corresponding to Babylon, Media, Persia, Greece, and Edom, who will enslave Israel before their redemption, and after these plunderings.

The righteous man is Jacob and his descendants. We must render in this manner: the straight way for the righteous man. ([Printed editions read:] The way for the righteous man to receive the reward for the upright deeds he performed.)
<b>O Upright One</b> You, the Holy One, blessed be He, the path of the feet of the righteous man, You shall weigh that way for him. This weighing is an expression of kontrepajjs in O.F., You counterbalance, equalize. Like a king who sits and thinks and weighs in his mind, which way is better, this one or that one.

@11
<b>O Lord, Your hand has been taken away</b> I have seen many Aggadic Midrashim on the verses of the above section and the following, but they are not appropriate, either because of the grammatical forms of the language or because of the context of the verses. I had to explain it according to its order. There is an Aggadic Midrash that states that the prophet begs that the nations not see the bounty of the Holy One, blessed be He, when He lavishes good upon Israel. The Holy One, blessed be He, replied, “It is better that they see and be ashamed,” (Eliyahu Zuta ch. 21). (The Midrash explains the verse as follows: O Lord, take away Your hand, so that they see not. I.e., the prophet begs that God conceal His might from the nations that they see it not. Thereupon, God replies, “Let them see and be ashamed...”) This does not fit with the language, however, since it does not say, “Raise Your hand.” Moreover, this word differs from all similar words. Every יָד רָמָה is accented on the final syllable, whereas this one is accented on the first syllable. Comp. (Gen. 37:7) “Behold, my sheaf rose (קָמָה).” Comp. also (Ruth 1:9) “Behold your sister in law has returned (שָׁבָה).” All of these are in the past tense. This too is to be explained: The hand of Your might has been taken away from upon Your enemies so that they see not Your might for they have seen that their way has prospered. I beg of You, let them see and be ashamed.
<b>the envy of a people</b> Let them see the bounty that You shall lavish upon Your people, Even they themselves shall see the judgment of Your vengeance, that the fire (of envy) shall consume them.
@12
<b>You shall prepare</b> (תִּשְׁפֹּת) you shall prepare. Comp. (II Kings 4:38) “Prepare (שְׁפוֹת) the... pot.” Also (Ps. 22:16), “And for the dust of death You have prepared me (תִּשְׁפְּתֵנִי).” (All) these can (likewise) be interpreted as an expression of placing, (or establishing). You shall establish peace for us.

@15
<b>You have added to the nation</b> to Israel (Tan. Pinchas 16) You added to them Torah and greatness and honor, and the more that You added to them, the more You were honored, for they thank You and praise You for all the bounty, unlike the custom of the heathens (var. of Esau). Therefore, You rejected from before You all other ends of the earth, i.e., all distant nations. Behold, in their bounty, in this manner the Israelites bestow praise and honor upon You, and in their straits.
@16

<b>neither do the inhabitants of the world fall</b> The nations (var. the children of Esau), who are the inhabitants of the world, since they conquered and filled the earth, do not fall. And Jonathan rendered יִפְּלוּ as an expression related to (Ex. 33:16): “And wonders shall be wrought (וְנִפְלִינוּ) for me and Your people.” The inhabitants of the world cannot perform a wonder.

I beseech You that those who were slain for Your sake come to life. May a royal edict emanate from You saying, “My corpses shall rise.” The corpses of My people who made themselves corpses for My sake, they shall be raised up. This is the opposite of what is written above (v. 14): “Slackers shall not rise.” These, however, shall rise.

<b>and [to the] earth You shall cast the slackers</b> And to the earth and to the dust You shall cast the land of (sic) the slackers who slackened their hands from Your Torah.
<b>You shall cast the slackers</b> Since he stated (v. 18) “Neither do the inhabitants of the world fall,” he repeats, “You cast them down, for our merits do not suffice to cast them down.”

@1
<b>on leviathan the barlike serpent</b> Jonathan renders: On the king who aggrandized himself like Pharaoh the first king, and upon a king who was as haughty as Sennacherib the second king. בָּרִיחַ is an expression of ‘straight’ like a bar, since he is the first. (The matter of simplicity is related to oneness. Since Pharaoh was the first great king, he is referred to as ‘the barlike serpent,’ a straight, penetrating serpent, that does not coil.)
<b>crooked</b> An expression of ‘double,’ since he is the second one. (I.e. the bend in the serpent indicates duality, thus the number two.) And I say that these are three important nations: Egypt, Assyria, and Edom. He, therefore, stated concerning these as he said at the end of the section (v. 13), “And those lost in the land of Assyria shall come, as well as those lost in the land of Egypt,” and since the nations are likened to serpents that bite.
<b>leviathan the barlike serpent</b> That is Egypt.
<b>leviathan the crooked serpent</b> That is Assyria.
<b>and He shall slay the dragon that is in the sea</b> That is Tzor that is the head of the children of Esau, and it is situated in the heart of the seas, and so Kittim are called the islands of the sea, and they are the Romans [according to certain manuscripts].

<b>every moment I water it</b> Little by little I water it with the cup of retribution that comes upon it, lest I visit upon it at once and I destroy it. Therefore, night and day I ponder about it. Jonathan renders: Were it not that I visit upon them the iniquities that they are accustomed to commit before Me, I would guard it day and night.
@4
<b>I have no wrath</b> I have no mouth (var. excuse) to arouse My wrath on the nations, for Israel sins as well, and the standard of justice accuses.
<b>would that I were thorns and briers against [the objects of My] war</b> Against those with whom I wage war, namely Ishmael (ms. Esau). Would that I could visit upon them and the standard of justice would not be able to protest, i.e., that Israel would repent, and that would give Me thorns and briers against the enemies! I would tread upon the standard of justice and I would visit upon them even more and additional punishment over their iniquity, and I would ignite them together. Jonathan rendered it in this manner, as referring to the nations. Our Sages of blessed memory explained it concerning Israel, and it refers back to the vineyard, as follows:
<b>I have no wrath</b> Despite all the angers with which this vineyard has provoked Me, I cannot pour out My wrath to destroy it because of the oath I swore to their forefathers. If only it were like days long past! Were it not for the oath, I would be thorns and briers and I would tread upon the vineyard, and I would ignite it together.
@5
<b>If they would grasp My fortress</b> (אוֹ), lit., or they would grasp My fortress,) an expression of ‘if.’ Comp. “(Ex. 21:36) If (אוֹ) it was known that he was a goring ox.” If My people grasp My fortress, i.e., My Torah, that they seek no other fortress but My fortress, then they shall grant Me peace, to calm My thoughts and My ire which trouble Me because I do not avenge Myself upon My adversaries, and I will, indeed, take revenge from them.

They drowned them in the water, and I drowned them in the water. There are some other rhetorical questions that warrant an affirmative answer, e.g. (I Sam. 2:27), “Did I appear to the house of your father?” Also (Ezek. 8:6), “Do you see what they are doing?”

<b>and this is all the fruit</b> that is best for Me to remove his sin, if he makes all the altar stones of his high places, like crushed chalk-stones. מְנֻפָּצוֹת means crushed. Comp. (Ps. 137:9) “And crushes (וְנִפֵּץ) your babies.” Comp. (Jer. 13:14) “And I will crush them (וְנִפַּצְתִּים) one against the other.” גִּיר is a kind of dye.

<b>there a calf shall graze</b> Ephraim shall inherit it, for he is called a calf, as it is said (Jer. 31:17): “Like an untamed calf.”
<b>and shall consume its branches</b> (סְעִיפֶיהָ) its branches.
@11
<b>When its branches dry out</b> The branches of its roots. Comp. (Ps. 80:12) “It sent forth its branches (קְצִירֶיהָ).” Also (Job 14:9): “And produce branches (קָצִיר).” I.e., when the little merit that Edom has for honoring his father, is depleted, then its branches shall be broken.
<b>women shall come and ignite it</b> A people weak as women shall ignite them. Jonathan renders in this manner. מְאִירוֹת means ‘ignite.’ Comp. (Mal. 1:10) “And you shall not light (תָּאִירוּ) My altar in vain.” Dunash too interpreted it in this manner, for since the wood will be dry, it will be easy to ignite. Menahem, however, interpreted it to mean ‘gather.’ Comp. (Song 5:1) “I gathered (אָרִיתִי) my myrrh.” Also (Ps. 80:13): “All passersby gathered from it (וְאָרוּהָ).” (Machbereth Menahem p. 32) Dunash replied, “Does it not say, ‘When its branches dry out’? And with dry grapes, no one gathers fruit.” (Teshuvoth Dunash p. 45)] Likewise, our Sages, who prohibited accepting charity from them because of this reason, for they stated in Baba Bathra ch. 1, (10b,) “Does he not believe, ‘When its branches dry out, they shall be broken?’”
@12
<b>that the Lord shall gather</b> יַחְבֹּט, lit., shall beat. Jonathan renders: shall fall dead. I.e., the nations from the banks of the Euphrates to the stream of Egypt. I say, however, that these two expressions, (viz.) beating and gathering, coincide with one another, like one who bears his olive trees and goes back and gathers them and (ms. or) others gather them from the ground, so will the Holy One, blessed be He, commence the gathering, as it is said: A great shofar shall be sounded.
<b>from the flood of the river</b> These are those lost in the land of Assyria.

<b>at the head of a valley of fatness</b> That is Kinnereth, whose fruits are sweet, and there they crush themselves with wine.
<b>crushed with wine</b> הֲלוּמֵי יַיִן. This may also be interpreted as follows: צבי תפארתו אשר על ראש וכו', (his glorious beauty, which is, etc.): His glorious beauty, which is on the head of the ten tribes, anointed with pride with the best oils, as it is said (Amos 6:6): “With the best oils they anoint themselves.” גֵּיא is an expression of pride, as (supra 16:6): “Moab, they have become very proud.” (And that blossom will be like a wilting blossom) crushed by wine. So he calls them because of their drunkenness, and it is said concerning them (Amos 6:6): “Those who drink with basins of wine.”

<b>they caused justice to stumble</b> (פָּקוּ פְּלִילֶיהָ), they caused justice to stumble. פָּקוּ is an expression similar to (Nahum 2:11), “The stumbling (פִּיק) of knees”; (I Sam. 25:31) “A stumbling block (פּוּקָה).”

@16
<b>Behold, I have laid a foundation</b> This is the past tense. Comp. (Esther 1:8) “For so had the king established (יִסַּד).” And so must it be interpreted: Behold, I am He Who has already laid [a stone in Zion. Already] a decree has been decreed before Me, and I have set up the King Messiah, who shall be in Zion as an אֶבֶן בּוֹחֵן, a fortress stone, an expression of a fortress and strength. Comp.

<b>and hail shall sweep away the shelter of lies</b> That covering that you said, “For we have made lies our shelter,” I will bring hail and it shall sweep it away. (וְיָעָה) is an expression of sweeping. Comp. (I Kings 7:40) “the shovels (הַיָּעִים)” with which they scoop up the ashes from the stoves.
<b>the hiding place</b> concerning which you said, “And in falsehood have we hidden ourselves,” the water shall flood it, i.e. I will bring a multitude of nations that will break your monuments and your graven images. The expression of מִשְׁפָּט mentioned here is jostise (justice) in O.F.
@18
<b>And your treaty with death shall be nullified</b> The treaty about which you said, “We have made a treaty with death,” shall be nullified. Every expression of כַּפָּרָה, atonement, is really an expression of wiping or removing something. Compare (Gen. 32:21): “I shall appease (אֲכַפְּרָה) his anger,” (lit., I will wipe away his anger.)

<b>to stretch</b> (מֵהִשְׂתָּרֵעַ) to lengthen one’s limbs, estandejlejjr in O.F.
<b>and the ruler it shall be narrow</b> (וְהַמַּסֵּכָה) The prince who will rule over you - your place will be cramped for him when he enters it. Our Rabbis, however, expounded it as referring to the idol that Manasseh brought into the heichal, (the Temple proper) (II Chron. 33:7). This bed is too short מֵהִשְׂתָּרֵעַ, for two friends to rule over it. I explained it according to its simple meaning, and in this manner Jonathan rendered it. The Midrashic interpretation of our Rabbis, however, can be reconciled with the context. I.e., why do I bring this retribution upon you? Because the bed is too narrow for Me alone to stretch out on it, as it is said (I Kings 8:27): “Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You.” Surely, when you bring in a molten image with Me, so to speak, the place is too narrow for us.

<b>all day</b> This is the interrogative. Therefore, it is voweled with a hataf pattah.
<b>shall...plow</b> One who plows to sow - does the one who plows to sow plow forever? If so, what does he accomplish? Similarly, the prophets admonish you to bring you back to do good deeds. Shall they admonish forever and not accomplish?
<b>Shall he open and harrow his soil?</b> Shall he never sow but always open the soil with plowshares and plowing implements? יְשַׂדֵּד is an expression of work of the field. Shall he open and harrow? First he makes wide furrows and later he makes small furrows. This we learned in the Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma.
@25
<b>Is it not</b> so that the plowman, as soon as he plows, smooths the surface of the soil and afterwards sows.
<b>he scatters the black cumin</b> If he comes to sow black cumin, he sows it by scattering it, and if he comes to sow cumin, he sows it by casting it. קצח is a kind of food.
<b>and he places the prominent wheat, and the barley for a sign, and the spelt on its borders</b> And if he comes to sow grain, this is his custom. He sows the wheat in the middle of the furrow, and the barley he sows around it for a sign, and the spelt he sows on the borders of the field [and its boundaries]. שׂוֹרָה is an expression of ruling (שְׂרָרָה). He sows it in the center, and it appears ([printed editions] is found) to rule over the barley and the spelt.
@26
<b>And He shall chasten him justly</b> Likewise, he whose God directs him, He shall not send prophets forever to admonish him. Since he does not heed admonition, He shall chasten him with judgments of chastening in order that the toil of His admonition will help, like the one who smoothes the surface of the earth to sow, in order that the toil of his plowing that he plowed shall succeed.
@27
<b>with a grooved [implement]</b> That is a wooden implement, made with grooves, and its name is מוֹרַג, a threshing-board, and one cuts the straw with it to be straw fodder.
<b>For not with a grooved [implement]</b> do they thresh the black cumin, for its seed is easily extracted from within its straw, and, likewise, on cumin they do not turn the wheel of a wagon to thresh it, because the black cumin is easily beaten with a staff and the cumin with a rod.
@28
<b>Bread grain is crushed</b> And whom (sic) do they crush with harsh implements? The bread of grain (sic), because it is not easily beaten.
<b>but it is not threshed forever</b> This כִּי is used in the sense of ‘but.’ But they do not crush it forever, [because they will not crush the seed kernels forever for them to be threshed to be crushed through the threshing-board and the wagon wheel].
<b>and the wheel of his wagon shall break and its separators</b> And when they turn the wagon wheels over to crush it and thresh it, even the wheel breaks, and the remaining implements of the wagon with it, that separate the grain from its straw, he will not crush it, and the wheat is not crushed to be ground. be threshed (אָדוֹשׁ יְדוּשֶׁנּוּ. The repetition is peculiar.) Comp. (Ezekiel 31:11) “He will deal (עָשׂה יַעֲשֶׂה),” also (supra 22:18): “He shall wind you around (צָנוֹף יִצְנָפְךָ).” And this ‘alef’ comes instead of a ‘heh’. Comp. (II Chron. 20:35) “And afterwards Jehoshaphat joined (אִתְחַבֵּר),” like הִתְחַבֵּר. Here too, אָדוֹשׁ[is like] הִדּוֹשׁ, and Menahem classified it in this manner (Machbereth p. 68).
@29
<b>This too, etc.</b> This too, like the custom of threshers of grain and those who flail black cumin and cumin, comes forth from the Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>He gave marvelous counsel</b> to show you hints in the manner of riddles and with an allegory, marvelous and obscure, for, just as with the cumin and the black cumin, with which they do not deal harshly by overthreshing them because they are easily flailed, so, if you would hasten to accept reproof, He would not bear heavily upon you with decrees, but since you are hard to accept reproof, like the grain that is hard to thresh, therefore, He will mete out heavy punishment upon you ([printed editions] - He will make it very heavy for you), but He will not strive and smite forever, ([certain editions]He will not strive and crush forever to destroy) just as one does not thresh forever, and His arrows and His blows shall terminate but you shall not terminate, in the manner that the wagon wheel breaks, but the wheat is not crushed. [If, however, you were easily destroyed, he would not test you with harsh afflictions, like the flax merchant, when he knows that his flax is of high quality, he beats it.]

<b>Woe, Ariel</b> Jonathan renders: Altar of the Lord. Ezekiel, too, called it that, as it is said (43: 16): “And the altar (וְהָאֲרִיאֵל) twelve [cubits] in length,” [because of the heavenly fire that lay like a lion atop the altar, as we learned in Tractate Yoma (21b)]. Our Sages, however, explained it in reference to the heichal (the Temple proper), which was narrow from the rear and wide in the front.
<b>the city wherein David encamped</b> The altar that was built in the city wherein David encamped [from Jonathan].
<b>add year to year</b> And always your sins are continuously increasing until your sacrifices are cut off (יִנְקֹפוּ), an expression similar to (supra 17:6): “like the cutting (כְּנֹקֶּף) of an olive tree.”

<b>They were intoxicated</b> yourselves (sic) but not from wine. Why? ([Parshandatha claims that this reading is erroneous. The correct reading, according to all manuscripts is:] their wise men, but not from wine.)
@10
<b>For the Lord has poured upon you, etc.</b> (נָסַךְ) an expression of mixing wine. Comp. (Prov. 9: 2) “She mixed (מָסְכָה) her wine.” It may also be an expression of princedom (נְסִיכוּת). He caused a spirit of deep sleep to overcome you, (lit., to rule over you). Concerning the transgressors of Israel he was prophesying, for they were stargazers and were experts in adjuring the heavenly princes, each one with the proper name for adjuring him. Therefore, they say, “Who will encamp upon us (Jer. 21:13)? If the enemy comes upon us, we can make for it a wall of fire around, ([Most manuscripts read:] If the enemy comes upon the city, we can make for it a wall of fire around,) or surround it with the Great Sea.” Said the Holy One, blessed be He, “I will change the heavenly princes; the one appointed over fire, is appointed over water. When he adjures the prince of fire to bring him fire, he will reply, “This is not mine,” And, likewise, the prince of water. And even the name by which you adjure him, he does not recognize. This is the closing of the eyes and the covering of the heads of the stargazers.
@11
<b>the vision of everything</b> All that you used to see in the constellations shall be concealed from you like the words of a letter sealed with wax, which, if they give to read one able to read a letter, he will say, “I cannot, for I see not what is inside, for it is sealed.”
@12
<b>And if the book is given</b> And when they take it from him and open its seal and give it to one who does not understand the language of the letter, and they say to him, “now read this,” he will say, “I cannot read.” Similarly, when you adjure the prince of fire, he will say, “I cannot, for the matter is sealed from me,” and when you adjure his colleague, he will say, “I do not recognize this name, by which you adjure me, for this is not my name.” This is what Jeremiah said (Jer. 21:4): “Behold I will turn around my implements of war that are in your hands.” This refers to the Explicit Name. In Midrash Tehillim (36:8).
@13
<b>Because this people has come near</b> Jonathan renders: Because this people has aggrandized itself. I.e., they have come near to raise themselves up to the heavens. They show themselves as though honoring Me with mouth and lip, but their heart they have drawn far away from Me.
<b>and their fear of Me has become</b> not wholehearted, but by the command of the people who teach them, they show themselves as humbled before Him in order to entice Him with your mouth.
@14
<b>Therefore, I will continue</b> I am He Who will continue to perform additional obscurity upon obscurity, concealment upon concealment, sealing upon sealing. And what is this obscurity upon obscurity? And the wisdom of their wise men shall be lost. The taking away of the sages of Israel is twice as hard as the destruction of the Temple and all the curses in Deuteronomy, for all of them are only one obscurity, as it is said (Deut. 28:59): “And the Lord shall make your plagues obscure (וְהִפְלָא),” whereas here are two obscurities.

<b>Shall...like the potter’s clay, etc.</b> This is an expression of a question, but there are questions to be answered in the affirmative.
<b>of him who made it</b> (לְעֹשֵׂהוּ, lit. to him who made it.) Like עַל עֹשֵׂהוּ. Comp. (Ex. 14:3) “And Pharaoh shall say of the children of Israel (וְלִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל).” (Jud. 9:54) “Lest they say of me (לִי), ‘A woman killed him.’”
<b>and the impulse say concerning the One Who formed it, “He does not understand”?</b> Did he say concerning the One Who formed it, “He does not understand what is in my impulse”? Did He not build the hidden recesses, the inner chambers, and the thoughts?

<b>the Lebanon shall be turned</b> The Lebanon, which is a forest of trees, shall be turned into a ‘karmel,’ a settlement of fields and vineyards.
<b>and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest</b> Jonathan renders: It shall be populated by large cities. And the Aggadah in Gen. Rabbah (24:1) explains it as forests of people, a settlement of cities and people, crowded and full, like this forest, which is full of trees.
@18
<b>And on that day...shall hear, etc.</b> And the curse stated above (v. 10 14): “For the Lord has poured upon you, etc....And the vision of everything has been to you, etc....And the wisdom of his wise men shall be lost,” shall be repealed.

<b>which was winnowed</b> The grain is winnowed twice, once with a shovel and once with a fan, in order to clean the grain. Therefore, the straw will be mixed with grain that was winnowed with a fan near the stubble.
<b>shovel</b> (רַחַת) paile (pelle) in O.F. (fan, [מִזְרֶה] van in O.F.) And the Midrash Aggadah states that בְּלִיל is an expression of mixing, that the food will be mixed into the straw. (I.e., the grain will be so plentiful that it will be mixed into the straw eaten by the cattle and donkeys.)

In Midrash Tehillim (1:20)].

<b>and the laying down of His arm</b> This is not an expression of resting but an expression of placing, posement in O.F. Comp.

And this is the interpretation of the verse in inverted order: And it shall be with drums and harps, every passing of the established staff upon which the Lord shall grant peace, and with wars of vain waving, lifting and lowering, did the Holy One, blessed be He, fight against them. And, according to Midrash Aggadah, the waving of the harvest of the Omer stood up for Israel in that war, for it was the night of the sixteenth of Nissan.

<b>and His words He did not retract</b> What He said, “And the Lord shall take you back to Egypt in ships” (Deut. 28:68). This is payment in kind, for I said to you, “You shall no longer see it (ibid.),” and you went there of your own free will. Eventually, you shall go there in exile against your will.

<b>shall turn His hand</b> For the Holy One, blessed be He, supports everything with His hand, and when He turns it, they will fall, like one who holds something in his hand, and when he inclines his hand, it falls.

@1
<b>Behold, for righteousness shall a king reign</b> Behold a king has no right to reign except to execute righteous judgment.
<b>and over princes who rule with justice</b> And over whom should he reign? Over princes who rule with justice. The prophet says this concerning Ahaz, who was a wicked man, but Hezekiah his son shall rule, and he is worthy. ([Manuscripts read:] And he is worthy of reigning.)
@2
<b>And the man shall be</b> The hero in the fear of the Holy One, blessed be He - that is Hezekiah - shall be for Israel.
<b>as a hiding place from the wind</b> As a shelter of a rock, where people hide because of the wind, and they hide there because of the heat ([mss. read:] because of the rain), so will those remaining from the ten tribes trust in him.

<b>as the shade of a huge rock in a weary land</b> In a sunny place, where the earth is weary and dry and yearning for shade.

<b>And the heart of the hasty shall understand to know</b> Not like now, that “this people’s heart is becoming fat” (ibid.).
<b>and the tongue of the stammerers, etc.</b> Not like now, “for with distorted speech” (supra 28:11).

@6
<b>speaks villainy</b> (יְדַבֵּר) like מְדַבֵּר, a present tense.
<b>works iniquity</b> (יַעֲשֶׂה) Gathers thoughts of iniquity. Comp. (Deut. 8:17) “Gathered (עָשָׂה) for me this wealth.”
<b>to practice flattery</b> (לֲַעֲשׂוֹת) He thinks thoughts how he can practice flattery. חֹנֵף is a noun; therefore, the accent is on the first syllable, it is vowelized with a ‘pattah’ (now called a ‘segol’).
<b>and the drink of the thirsty he causes to fail</b> According to the simple meaning, they rob the poor. The Targum, (however, paraphrases:) The words of the Torah, which are like water to the thirsty, they plan to nullify.
@7
<b>and when the needy speaks a plea</b> (מִשְׁפָּט) To destroy the needy in his plea (מִשְׁפָּטוֹ). This word מִשְׁפָּט is an expression denoting the initial presentation of the case; when the needy presents his pleas, this one plans wicked plots to trap him with his devices. The word מִשְׁפָּט has three meanings: the initial pleas (derajjsnement in O.F.), the sentence (joujjment), and the execution of the verdict, that they discipline him with chastisement (joustize in O.F.).

<b>Year after year</b> (lit., ‘days upon a year.’) Comp. (supra 29:1) “Add year to year,” and your sins are constantly becoming more serious, until eventually you shall be troubled, those who are now confident, for the vintage of the grapes shall be over for them, and the ingathering of the grain shall not come into the house.
<b>the ingathering</b> (אֹסֶף) This is a noun; therefore, its accent is on the first syllable and it is vowelized with a ‘pattah’ (now called a ‘segol’).
@11
<b>to be troubled</b> (רְגָזָה) to be troubled. (This is an infinitive despite the absence of the ‘lammed.’)
<b>to undress</b> (פְּשֹׁטָה) to undress. (This too is an infinitive with the ‘lammed’ missing.)
<b>and to bare</b> (וְעֹרָה) An expression of ‘naked’ (עֶרְיָה) (Micah 1:11).
<b>and to gird</b> (וַחֲגוֹרָה) Therefore, the accent is before the last syllable, and so did Jonathan render: Undress and bare yourselves and gird on your loins. Since they will undress and bare themselves of their garments, they will not gird on their garments but on their loins.
@12
<b>on the breasts, lamenting</b> They shall beat their heart.
<b>for the desirable fields</b> For the fields of their desire. The Midrash Aggadah (See twenty-fourth poem to Lamentations Rabbah) states: For the sages of the Sanhedrin, who are like breasts that nurture, they will lament, and for the city of their desire that will be plowed up like a field, and for the fruitful - vine that is Israel, called a vine, as it is said (Psalms 80:9): “You plucked a vine out of Egypt.”
@13
<b>Thorns and briers</b> The Targum renders: הוּבֵאִי וּבוּר various types of thorns, for all this destruction shall be on all houses of joy, and on
<b>the joyful city</b> Jerusalem, which is “the joy of all the land” (Lamentations 2:15).

<b>the multitude of the city</b> has been exiled.
<b>rampart and tower</b> My Temple, which was a fortification for them.
<b>are amidst ruins</b> (הָיָה בְּעַד מְעָרוֹת), shall be amidst ruins. מְעָרוֹת is an expression similar to (Psalms 137:7) “Raze it, raze it (עָרוּ עָרוּ).” בְּעַד is like “(Job 22:13) Can He judge through (הַבְעַד) a thick cloud?”
<b>forever</b> Until the time of the end.
<b>a joy for wild donkeys</b> For the lust of Ishmael and his hosts.
@15
<b>Until...be poured upon us</b> (יֵעָרֶה) He shall pour upon us. Comp. (Gen. 24:2) “And she emptied (וַתְּעַר) her pitcher.” An expression of pouring applies to spirit. Comp. (Zech. 12:10) “And I will pour upon the house of David...a spirit of grace.” Comp. also (Joel 3:1) “I will pour My spirit upon all flesh.”
<b>shall be regarded as a forest</b> (Jonathan renders:) Great cities, like this forest, which is full of trees.
@16
<b>And justice shall dwell in the desert</b> In Jerusalem, which is like a desert.
<b>and righteousness shall reside in the fruitful field</b> That is the land of Israel, which in those days shall be like a fruitful field.
@19
<b>And He shall hail down the hailing of the forest</b> (וּבָרַד בְּרֶדֶתהַיָּעַר) Perforce, this word וּבָרָד is not a noun, since half of it is vowelized with a ‘kamatz’ and half of it with a ‘pattah’ in an expression of פָּעַל. (Rashi distinguishes בָּרַד from בָּרָד, the noun denoting hail.) And so is its interpretation, an expression of an action, like ‘and he shall wash’ (וְרָחַץ), ‘and he shall sit’ (וְיָשַׁב), ‘and he shall stand’ (וְעָמַד). Here too, וּבָרַד ‘and He shall hail down the hailing of the forest.’ Then the ‘beth’ of בְּרֶדֶת is a radical, like עֲטֶרֶת, ‘a crown,’ עֲקֶרֶת ‘a barren woman.’ That is to say that the Holy One, blessed be He, shall rain down the rain of the coals of the wicked, those who are now built up and full of cities like a forest.
<b>and into the low state</b> Into which Israel has been humbled until now, shall the metropolis of Persia (Seir, Edom, [according to various mss.]) be humbled. In a similar manner did Jonathan render it: And hail will come down and kill the camps of the nations.
@20
<b>Fortunate are you</b> Israel, that the sowing of your righteousness has succeeded like those who sow by all waters. From now on, you shall reap and gather the grain of your good reward; you shall send forth the feet of the ox to thresh the grain, and the donkey to bring it into the house. So did Jonathan render it: You shall receive the reward of your good work.

@1
<b>Woe</b> To the enemy, that you constantly spoil, but you are not spoiled, and you constantly deal treacherously, but no man deals treacherously with you or spoils you.
<b>when you finish</b> being a spoiler, when you finish your spoiling of those upon whom it was decreed to be spoiled by you, you shall be spoiled.
<b>when you finish dealing treacherously</b> (כַּנְּלֹתְךָ) Menahem classified כַּנְלֹתְךָ with (Job 15: 29) “And their destruction (מִנְלָם) shall not fall to the earth,” in one group (Machbereth Menahem, p. 123). In the word מִנְלָם, the first ‘mem’ is a radical which sometimes is absent, like the ‘mem’ of מַאֲמָר, a statement, and of מַדָּע, knowledge, and it is possibly an expression of ending, according to the context. כַּנְּלֹתְךָ is an expression of ‘when you finish.’ “And מִנְלָם shall not fall to the earth,” the destruction decreed upon them shall not fall to the earth to become progressively void, but will become progressively stronger.
@2
<b>Be their arm</b> of the spoiled ones in the hand of the spoiler. (Note that we followed other editions of Rashi. Nach Lublin is erroneous in this passage.)

@3
<b>From the sound of roaring</b> that emanated from before You, peoples wandered until here when You performed wondrous miracles for us.
@4
<b>And your booty shall be gathered</b> This refers back to “when you finish dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with you,” and your booty, you, who spoil My people, when your reckoning comes, the remnant of My people shall plunder you and gather your booty like the gathering of locusts, each one of whom gathers grain for himself in summer; here too, each one will plunder for himself.
<b>like the roaring of the cisterns</b> Like the sound of the roar of water gathering and falling into the cisterns in the river, so will those coming to plunder and pillage, roar. מַשַּׁק is an expression of roaring. Comp. (Prov. 28:15) “A roaring lion and a growling (שׁוֹקֵק) bear.” Also (Zeph. 2:9), “The noise (מִמְשַׁק) of the thorns.” When the wind blows on the thorns, and they knock against one another, they produce a sound. Comp. also, (Joel 2:9) “In the city they roar (יָשֹׁקּוּ).”
<b>cisterns</b> (גֵּבִים) like (supra 30: 14) “or to scoop water from a cistern (מִגֶּבֶא).” Our Sages expounded it in the Aggadah of Chapter Chelek (San. 94b) as referring to the booty of Sennacherib’s soldiers.

Another explanation is:
<b>faith of your times</b> What you believed in the Holy One, blessed be He, in times that passed over you, and you hoped for salvation, shall become your strength.
<b>fear of the Lord</b> That you shall fear Him - that is a good treasure to open up for you from before Him.
@7
<b>Behold [for] their altar they have cried in the street</b> The prophet was prophesying consolations and saying that the retribution had already been completed, and from now I will rise and exalt Myself to redeem them.

<b>The King in His beauty shall your eyes behold</b> (The Holy One, blessed be He, Who is a King, Him you shall see from a distant land where you are standing. You shall see the miracles and the greatness that I will perform for you, and a people of a strange tongue, of obscure speech, shall not see the Shechinah of the King in His beauty. [This does not appear in many editions.]) The King in His beauty shall your eyes behold. To you, O righteous man, I say that you shall merit to see the splendor of the Shechinah of the Omnipresent.
<b>they shall see [from] a distant land</b> Jonathan renders: You shall look and see those who go down to the land of Gehinnom.
@18
<b>Your heart shall meditate [in] fear</b> When you see the princes and the savants of the heathens, who ruled during their lifetime, and who are now being judged in Gehinnom, your heart will meditate in terror, and you will say, “Where is the wisdom and the greatness of these men? Where is the one who, during his lifetime, would count and weigh every word of wisdom, for they would ask him every counsel of the kingdom?
<b>Where is he who counts the towers</b> This too is a matter of the kingdom. He is appointed over the houses of the kingdom, how many they are, and how many towers a certain city requires. Comp. (Ps. 48:13) “Encircle Zion and surround it, count its towers,” how many towers it requires.
@19
<b>A people of a strange tongue</b> (נוֹעָז) like לוֹעֵז. These are all the heathens, whose language is not the holy tongue. ([Other editions read:] These are Assyria and Babylon, whose language is not the holy tongue.) ([Manuscripts read:] These are all the nations whose language is not the holy tongue.)
<b>you shall not see</b> You shall not esteem in your heart, for they shall all be dark and humble.
<b>speech... obscure</b> (שָׂפָה, lit. lip.) Comp. (Gen. 11:1) “And all the land was one speech (שָׂפָה).” of stammering tongue (נִלְעָג לָשׁוֹן). Comp.

@20
<b>See Zion</b> But whom will you see in your heart to be regarded as a kingdom and a ruling power? Zion, which is the city of our meeting place.
<b>that shall not fall</b> (יִצְעָן) shall not be lowered. Comp. (Jud. 4:11) “Elon-bezaanannim (אֵלוֹן בְּצַעֲנַנִּים),” which is rendered as: the plain of pits (מִישׁוֹר אַגְנַיָּא), which are pits in the fields, called kombes in O.F. Comp. (Baba Kamma 61b) “The pits of the earth (אַגְנֵי דְאַרְעָא) they are considered,” where water gathers from the mountains and the hills. I believe that the ‘beth’ of the word בְּצַעֲנַנִּים is not radical, but is a prefix.
<b>whose pegs shall never be moved</b> (יִסַּע) The pegs with which they tie the ropes of the tent he shall not move them from the earth, from the place into which they are thrust. Comp. (I Kings 5:31) “And they quarried (וַיַּסִּעוּ) great stones.” Also (Jud. 16:3), “And he plucked them (וַיִּסּעֵם) together with the bolt,” an expression of uprooting.
@21
<b>But there</b> ‘But’ refers back to ‘whose pegs shall never be moved,’ and ‘shall not be torn.’ The evil shall not be, only the good. There the Lord shall be mighty for us, and the city shall be a place of rivers and streams, in the manner it is said in Ezekiel (47:4f.): “And He measured a thousand (cubits), and He led me...a stream that I could not cross.” And so did Joel prophesy (4:18) “And a spring shall emanate from the house of the Lord,” that it shall become progressively stronger.

<b>shall be rolled</b> (וְנָגֹלּוּ) an expression of rolling. And the heavens shall be rolled like a scroll. Jonathan renders: And they shall be erased from beneath the heavens, as it is stated about them in the Book. But I explain it according to the context, for now, the kingdoms of the Ishmaelites (the nations [ms.]) (the wicked [Warsaw ed.]) have fortune and light. When they are erased and destroyed, it will be as though the world has darkened for them, as though the sun and the light are rolled up like the rolling of a scroll.
<b>withers</b> (יִבּוֹל) withers.
<b>and as a withered [fig] from a fig tree</b> The withered fruit of a tree is called נוֹבְלוֹת. This is what our Rabbis (Ber. 40b) explained: What are ‘noveloth’? Fruit ripened in the heater, that become ripe in the heater. After they are picked, he gathers them and they become heated and ripen.
@5
<b>For My sword has become sated in the heaven</b> To slay the heavenly princes, and afterward it shall descend on the nation Ishmael ([mss. and Kli Paz:] Edom) ([Warsaw ed.:] Babylonians) below, for no nation suffers until its prince suffers in heaven. the nation with whom I contend (עַם חֶרמִי), the nation with whom I battle. This is a Mishnaic expression: (Keth. 17b) They taught this in connection with time of strife (חֵרוּם). Comp. (I Kings 20:42) “The man with whom I contend (אִישׁ חֶרְמִי),” referring to Ahab.
@6

<b>in Bozrah</b> It is from the land of Moab, but since it supplied a king for Edom, as it is stated (Gen. 36:33): “And Jobab son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead,” it will, therefore, suffer with them. This is found in Pesikta.
@7

@10
<b>from generation to generation</b> From that generation until the last generation. Another explanation is that this is Moses’ curse (Ex. 17:16): “The Lord has a war against Amalek from generation to generation.” From Moses’ generation to Saul’s generation, and from there to Mordecai’s generation, and from there to the generation of the King Messiah.

@16
<b>Seek out of the Book of the Lord</b> Read out of the Book of Genesis; when He brought the Flood, He decreed that all the creatures gather in the Ark, male and female, and none of them was missing. How much more will this be so when He decrees this upon them, to gather to drink blood and to eat flesh and fat!
<b>did not miss</b> (פָקָדוּ) Comp. (Num. 31:49) “Not a man was missing (נִפְקַד) of us.”
<b>for My mouth it has commanded</b> that they come, and the breath of My mouth it gathered them. The antecedent of ‘its breath’ is ‘My mouth.’ Comp. (Ps. 33:6) “And with the breath of His mouth all their host.” Here too, the breath of My mouth it gathered them.
@17

#35
@1
<b>shall rejoice over them</b> (יְשֻׂשׂוּם) This is usually the sign of the direct object, inappropriate here in the case of an intransitive verb. (like יָשׂוּשׂוּ מֵהֶם, shall rejoice from them). Comp. (Jer. 10:20) “My sons have gone away from me (יְצָאֻנִי).” Also, (I Kings 19:21) “He cooked the meat for them (בִּשְּׁלָם),” equivalent to בִּשֵּׁל לָהֶם, “He cooked the meat for them.”
<b>Desert and wasteland</b> Jerusalem, called ‘wasteland,’ and Zion, called ‘desert,’ they shall rejoice over the downfall of the mighty of the heathens and Persia ([Manuscripts yield:] of Edom and Bozrah). ([The Warsaw edition reads:] the mighty of Seir (and Bozrah).)

<b>Strengthen weak hands</b> (חַזְּקוּ) All the prophets who brought tidings of salvation consoled Israel and strengthened their weak hands. (The word) is in the intensive conjugation, and its meaning is (the causative, i.e.,) strengthen others. If he intended to say, “Be strong, you whose hands are weak,” it would be vowelized like (2 Chron. 32:7) “Be strong (חִזְקוּ) and be firm (וְאִמְצוּ).” Now that he says to them to strengthen others and to make others firm, it is vowelized, חַזְּקוּ, אַמְּצוּ. “Be strong (חִזְקוּ), do not fear” is vowelized חִזְקוּ, a form of the ‘kal’ conjugation, meaning ‘you be strong by yourselves,’ as one says to singular (Jos. 1:6), “Be strong and be firm (חֲזַק ֶמָץ),” and he does not say, חַזֵּק.

@7
<b>And the dry place shall become a pool</b> He who longs for salvation shall be saved. The prophet spoke figuratively.
<b>in the habitat of jackals, a resting place, etc.</b> A place that was a desert wasteland, which is the habitat, the resting place of jackals, shall become moist, a place of grass, made for reeds and rushes, and it is not customary for reeds and rushes to grow except in a watery place, as the matter is stated (Job 8:11): “Can the rush shoot upwards without mire?”
<b>a resting place</b> (רִבְצָה) This is a noun like מַרְבֵּץ, since it has no ‘mappiq hey.’

The word דֶּרֶךְ is used both as masculine and feminine gender, as it is written (Ex. 18:20): “The way (הַדֶּרֶךְ) upon which (בָּהּ) they shall walk.” (Lit., on her.) Thus it is feminine. Comp.

<b>their dung</b> The kethib reads חֹרָאֵיהֶם, the dung that is excreted through their orifice. Our Sages instituted to euphemize and read it צוֹאָתָם, i.e., their dung. Thus did our Rabbis teach: Verses written in uncomplimentary words are to be read in a complimentary manner, e.g., (Deut. 28:27) עֲפֹלִים (is read) טְחֹרִים. (Both mean hemorrhoids. The former means ‘that which is in the dark holes,’ being more explicit than the latter. (ibid. v. 30) יִשְׁגָּלֶנָּה (is to be read) יִשְׁכָּבֶנָּה. (Both denoting intimacy, the former related as well to a dog.) חֹרָאֵיהֶם (is to be read) צוֹאָתָם, שִׁינֵיהֶם (is to be read) מֵימֵי רַגְלֵיהֶם.
<b>their urine</b> The kethib is שִׁינֵיהֶם, loose excrement. The teeth of the large intestine. That is the intestine called tabahie in O.F. that stands on three teeth, (i.e. the glands of the rectum, which is held by three glands. They are called שִׁנַּיִּם because they are shaped like teeth).

<b>Have you not heard from long ago</b> More than seventy years (correct version as in Parshandatha and Warsaw edition) since Amos prophesied two years before the earthquake (Amos 7:17), “and Israel shall be exiled from upon its land.” Since then, you should have heard that I wrought and prepared this retribution.
<b>in days of yore</b> Since the six days of Creation, that decree that was decreed upon you entered My mind, as it is said (supra 30:33): “For Tophteh is set up from yesterday, that too has been prepared for the king.” Now that I have given you superiority over the nations, I have brought it, that decree, in order that it shall be to make desolate, blossoming hills [of] fortified cities, that you shall slay their inhabitants and they shall remain devoid of people and they shall be prepared for hills where vegetation grows.

This is what we learned, “and the female camel with a nose ring” in Tractate Shabbath (5:1). (This is difficult in view of the wording of the verse, which places חַח in the nose and מֶתֶג in the lips.)
@30
<b>And this shall be the sign for you</b> This statement is not addressed to Sennacherib, but the prophet said to Hezekiah, “And this salvation shall be a sign for you for another promise. Now the legions have destroyed all the vegetation and chopped off the trees, and the Holy One, blessed be He, promises you that you will have sufficient from the shoots of the plants that will grow by themselves.”
<b>this year you shall eat</b> (אָכוֹל) to eat this year.
<b>and the next year what grows from the tree stumps</b> (Heb. שָׁחִיס.) They are the shoots of the stumps. So it appears in Seder Olam (ch. 23), but Jonathan renders: כַּתְכַּתִּין, the shoots of the shoots. And this will be the sign for you; when you see that my words, that Sennacherib will return to his land and he will fall, are fulfilled, you will believe that the second promise will yet be fulfilled.

<b>a siege mound</b> (סֹלְלָה) since it is trodden (סוֹלְלִים) and pressed down with sledge hammers in order that it harden. The Targum renders: מִלֵּיתָא, since they first make for it two walls of a fence of reeds and pour the earth between them and press it down there after they have filled (מִלְאוּ) the walls. And I heard that they interpret it as the throwing of huge stones, called perere in O.F., but the expression of piling up, lit., spilling, does not apply to stones, neither is the expression of pressing down, nor the rendering of the Targum, appropriately for this interpretation.
@36
<b>And an angel of the Lord went forth, etc.</b> After he went and battled with Cush, he returned and came to Jerusalem, and at the time an angel of the Lord went forth. In the following manner, it was taught in Seder Olam (ch. 23): (supra v. 7) “Behold I will imbue him with a desire, and he will hear a rumor,” as it is said (v. 9): “And he heard about Tirhakah etc.” He swept Shebna (the scribe) ([Warsaw edition:] the treasurer) and his company and led them in chains, and went away to Cush, and took all the coveted treasures, and came to Jerusalem, to fulfill what was stated (infra 45: 14): “The toil of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush...shall pass over to you.” This refers to Jerusalem. “After you they shall go.” This refers to Hezekiah. At that time, “And...sent Tartan and Rabsaris.” They are the ones mentioned in the Book of Kings (2 18:17), and they are the emissaries concerning whom it is stated that he sent after the rumor, as it is said (v. 9), “And he sent emissaries to Hezekiah,” and they did not come with Rabshakeh on his first mission. And concerning those letters, Hezekiah replied (v. 22), “...has despised you, has mocked you.” At that time, “an angel of the Lord went out and slew, etc.” All of them were kings with crowns ti ed to their heads, and the smallest of them was an officer over two thousand men, and they and their armies fell.

(Zeph. 1:11) “For the entire people of Canaan has been silenced (נִדְמָה).” That is to say that when I became ill, I said, “I will go into the gates of the grave.” Now I will die, since, until that day, no sick person had recovered.
<b>I am deprived of the rest of my years</b> (פֻּקַּדְתִּי) Comp. “(Num. 31:49) No man was missing (נִפְקַד) of us.” I am missing the rest of my years. Jonathan, however, renders: My remembrance has entered for good; years have been added to my years. I have been visited (נִפְקַדְתִּי) for good, and my years have been increased.

<b>like a shepherd’s tent</b> Like the tent of one who tends animals, which he moves from here and sets up in another pasture when this pasture is depleted.
<b>I severed</b> (קִפַּדְתִּי) I severed my life quickly, like a weaver who hastens to weave. All this I thought. Jonathan renders: Like a stream with banks, like a stream that flows between high banks, which does not spread out, and consequently, its water flows swiftly. And I say that it is a swift stream named Oreg, and this is what Job (7:6) said, “My days are lighter than Areg,” also (ibid. 9:26), “They passed with the ships of Ebeh.”
<b>from glory He shall deprive me</b> (מִדַּלֶּה יְבַצְּעֵנִי). Jonathan renders: From the glory of my kingdom I am exiled. I thought that now He would deprive me of all my glory. The word דַלָּה is an expression of height. Comp. (Song 7:5) “And the braid (וְדַלַּת) of your head.”
<b>from day and night You shall finish me</b> (lit., from day to night.) Comp. (Num. 5:3) “Both male and female,” (lit., from male to female.) That is to say, from days and nights you shall finish me, and so did Jonathan render: My days and my nights are over.

<b>Rob me</b> (עָשְׁקָה), like עֲשֹׁק. Rob me, take me out of the hand of the angel of death, and pledge Yourself to save me. This (עָרְבֵנִי) is an expression of surety (garantieh in O.F.). Comp. (Ps. 119) “Pledge Yourself (עֲרוֹב) to Your servant for good.”

@16
<b>O Lord! Concerning them, [You said] they shall live</b> Jonathan renders: O Lord! Concerning all the dead, You said to resurrect.

<b>‘How can I serve Him and repay Him for all the years,’</b> He caused His Shechinah and His kindness to rest upon them and said to me through His prophets, that they shall live.
<b>and to all upon which the life of my soul depends</b> And to everything upon which the life of my soul depends, the Lord said concerning them and they shall live.
<b>and You shall make me well</b> From now on, I know that you shall make me well and give me life.
<b>You shall make me well</b> (תַּחְלִימֵנִי) You shall make me well and strengthen me. Comp. (Job 39:4) “Their children shall become strong (יַחְלְמוּ).”
@17
<b>Behold for peace, it is bitter for me, yea it is bitter</b> When I was notified of the tidings of peace, even that was bitter for me, for my recovery was dependent upon the merit of others (v. 5): “So has the Lord God of your father David said...”; (supra 37:35) “For My sake and for the sake of David your father.” Here You let me know that I am a sinner (See Ber. 10b). (So did the Sages explain it, but in order to reconcile the verse, it appears to mean: Behold for peace, it was bitter for me, yea it was bitter - When I was given the news by You that You would save me from the hand of Sennacherib, it was bitter for me, yea it was bitter because of my illness, that I was close to death, and I did not rejoice with the news.) But You desired my soul, that it descend not to the grave.

Since the sphere of the sun had gone backwards because of Hezekiah, he awoke from his sleep after nine hours and found that it was morning. He sought to kill all his servants. He said, “You let me sleep a day and a night until morning!” They said to him, “It was the sphere of the sun that went backwards.” He said to them, “Who brought it back?” They said to him, “The God of Hezekiah, etc.” As is stated in Tanhuma (Ki Thissa 5) and in Pesikta (d’ Rav Kahana p. 14a).

Hezekiah should have replied, “You are a prophet of the Omnipresent. Yet you ask me?” Instead, he commenced to become haughty, and said, “They have come to me from a distant country.” Therefore, he was punished, and because he rejoiced over them and fed them on his table. Similarly, Balaam, to whom He said, “Who are these men with you?” (Num 22:9) And he replied and said, “Balak the son of Zippor sent them to me.” Similarly, Cain, to whom He said, “Where is your brother Abel?” (Gen. 4:9) He should have replied, “Lord of the Universe, are not all hidden things revealed to You?” As it is stated in Tanhuma.

<b>for she has taken etc.</b> [Jonathan paraphrases:] For she has received a cup of consolation from before the Lord as though she has been punished doubly for all her sins. According to its simple meaning, it is possible to explain, ‘for she received double punishment.’ Now if you ask, how is it the standard of the Holy One, blessed be He, to pay back a person double his sin, I will tell you that we find an explicit verse (Jer. 16:18): “And I will pay first the doubling of their iniquity and their sin.”

<b>Every valley shall be raised</b> and the mountain shall be lowered, thus resulting in a smooth, even, and easily traversed road.
<b>and the close mountains</b> Heb. רְכָסִים, mountains close to each other, and because of their proximity, the descent between them is steep and it is not slanted, that it should be easy to descend and ascend. ([The word] רְכָסִים is translated by Jonathan as ‘banks,’ an expression of height like the banks of a river.)
<b>close mountains</b> Heb. רְכָסִים. Comp. (Ex. 28:28) “And they shall fasten (וְיִרְכְּסוּ) the breastplate.”

<b>A voice</b> from the Holy One, blessed be He, says to me, “Call!”
<b>and it says</b> My spirit says to Him, “What shall I call?” And the voice answers him, “Call this, all flesh is grass. All those who are haughty their greatness shall be turned over and become like grass. ([Manuscripts yield:] All the princes of the kingdom their greatness shall be turned over and shall wither away [lit. shall end] like grass.)
<b>and all its kindness is like the blossom of the field</b> For “the kindness of the nations is sin” (Prov. 14:34). [Ed. note: We have inverted the order of Rashi and followed the order of K’li Paz and Parshandatha, to connect the second part of the verse with the first. Rashi’s explanation of the second part follows his first explanation of the first part. In the Lublin edition, the second explanation of the first part of the verse interrupts the sequence.] (Another explanation is: All flesh is grass.) A person’s end is to die; therefore, if he says to do kindness, he is like the blossom of the field, that is cut off and dries, and one must not rely on him, for he has no power to fulfill his promise, perhaps he will die, for, just as the grass dries out and the blossom wilts, so is it that when a man dies, his promise is null, but the word of our God shall last for He is living and existing, and He has the power to fulfill. Therefore, “Upon a lofty mountain ascend and herald, O herald of Zion, for the promise of the tidings emanates from the mouth of Him Who lives forever.”

<b>O herald of Zion</b> Heb. מְבַשֶּׂרֶת. The prophets who herald Zion. [This is the feminine form.] Elsewhere (infra 52:7), he says, “the feet of the herald (מְבַשֵּׂר).” [This is the masculine form.] This denotes that if they are worthy, he will be as swift as a male. If they are not worthy, he will be as weak as a female and will delay his steps until the end.

(Num. 22:24) “In the path (בְּמִשְׁעוֹל) of the vineyards, a path (for walking).” Another explanation is that שַׁעַל is the name of a receptacle. Comp.

Another interpretation: בַּשָּׁלִשׁ, from the thumb to the middle finger, the third of the fingers. Menahem explains it as the name of a vessel. Comp. (Ps. 80:6) “And You gave them to drink tears with a vessel (שָׁלִישׁ) .”

The Lord, and the one with whom He takes counsel He informs him, i.e., the righteous in whom God confides, He informs of His plans for the future.] But, according to its context, וְאִישׁ עֲצָתוֹ refers back to the beginning of the verse.

<b>Behold the nations are like a drop from a bucket</b> And are not worthy to Him to appoint some of them as prophets to reveal His secret.

<b>But you, Israel My servant</b> and I am obliged to help you. The end of this sentence is (infra 10): “Do not fear.” This appears to me to be the sequence of the section according to its simple meaning. But the Midrash Aggadah in Gen. Rabbah 44:7 expounds the entire section as alluding to Malchizedek and Abraham.
<b>[5] Islands saw</b> the war and feared. Shem [Malchizedek] feared Abraham, lest he say to him, You begot these wicked men in the world. And Abraham feared Shem, since he slew his sons, the people of Elam, who was descended from Shem.

<b>[6] Each one aided his fellow</b> This one [Shem] aided this one [Abraham] with blessings, “Blessed be Abram” (Gen. 14:19), and this one [Abraham] aided this one [Shem] with gifts, “And he gave him tithe from everything” (ibid. verse 20).
<b>[7] And the craftsman strengthened</b> This is Shem, who was a blacksmith, to make nails and bars for the ark.
<b>the smith</b> This is Abraham, who purified (צוֹרֵף) the people, to bring them near to God [lit. to Heaven].
<b>the sledge hammer</b> This is Abraham, who smote (הָלַם) all these kings at one time.

This is the rule: Every word whose first radical is ‘shin,’ when it is used in the reflexive present, past, or future, the ‘tav’ separates it and enters between the first two radicals. Comp. (infra 49:16) “And He was astounded (וַיַּשְׁתּוֹמֵם)”; (Micah 6:16) “For the statutes of Omri shall be observed (וְיִשְׁתַּמֵּר)”; (I Sam. 1: 14) “will you be drunk (תִּשְׁתַּכָּרִין)?”; (Job 30:16) “My soul is poured out (תִּשְׁתַּפֵּךְ).”

<b>is parched</b> Heb. נָשָׁתָּה. An expression similar to (supra 19:5) “And water from the sea shall dry up (וְנִשְּׁתּוּ).” An expression similar to (Lam. 3:45) “The destruction (הַשֵּׁאת) and the breach.” And all of them are an expression of destruction and dryness. Therefore, a ‘dagesh’ appears in the ‘tav,’ since it comes instead of two, for there is no שֵׁאת without a ‘tav,’ and he should have said for the feminine וְנָשָׁתְתָה, since for the masculine singular he says נשתה and for the plural ונשתו.

<b>from the rising of the sun he shall call in My name</b> (Ezra 1:2) “All the kingdoms of the earth has the Lord God of the heavens given me.” And it appears that Persia is northeast of Eretz Israel. Another explanation is: I aroused Nebuchadnezzar from the north to destroy My city, and he came, and I aroused Cyrus from the east, that he call in My name to build My city, for the kingdom of Persia is east of Eretz Israel, as it is stated (Dan. 8:4): “I saw the ram butting etc.” [This verse in Daniel proves it. “I saw the ram butting to the west and to the north and to the south.” We deduce that he came from the east.] Jonathan paraphrases: I brought speedily a king, strong as the north wind, and he will come as the sun comes out with its might from the east; I will strengthen him with My name.

<b>their molten images</b> Heb. נִסְכֵּיהֶם. Comp. (supra 40:19) “The graven image the craftsman melted (נָסַךְ).” Jonathan renders this section differently:
<b>[27] The first one to Zion etc.</b> The words of consolation that the prophets prophesied concerning Zion, from before, behold they have come. And according to the Targum, the entire section speaks of the King Messiah and of the last redemption, but I see that the prophecy that Isaiah prophesied concerning Cyrus is all in the same language as this section. Comp. (infra 45:13) “I aroused him with righteousness”; (Infra 46:11) “Calling from the east a bird of prey”; (infra 45:11) “The signs ask Me;” (infra 46:10) “Who tells from the beginning the end.” All of this resembles the topic of this section.

<b>I will do them</b> Heb. עֲשִׂיתִם [lit. I did them], I will do. So is the language of prophecy, to speak of the future as if it was already done.

<b>all their youths are grieved</b> Heb. הָפֵחַ בַּחוּרִים, all their youths are grieved. (Addendum: Another explanation of הָפֵח בַּחוּרִים כֻּלָם They will put themselves into snares (פַּחֵי) of the earth and into pits. [The clause,] “And they are hidden in dungeons,” proves that this is so.)
<b>and no one says, “Return.”</b> Heb. הָשַׁב, like הָשֵׁב [the imperative]. Therefore, it is not punctuated with a dagesh, but (Gen. 43:17) “That returned (הַשָּׁב) in our sacks,” is punctuated with a ‘dagesh.’

<b>and to the south</b> which is a strong wind, “Do not refrain from blowing strongly to bring My exiles.” Similarly (Song 4: 16), “Awaken, O north wind, and come, O south wind.” Since the north wind is weak, it needs strengthening. Therefore, it is written, “Awaken,” “Give.” But concerning the south wind which does not need straightening, it is written, “Come,” as it is, and so, “Do not refrain.”

That is to say, that although they experienced exile and trouble, I prepared for them all the necessities of their redemption.

<b>Because of you, I sent [you] to Babylon</b> Jonathan paraphrases: Because of your sins I exiled you to Babylon.
<b>and I lowered them all with oars</b> Heb. וְהוֹרַדְתִּי בָרִיחִים. Jonathan renders: And I lowered with oars (בִּמְשׁוֹטִין), all of them. מְשׁוֹטִין denotes the wood that guides the ship and straightens it out.
<b>and Chaldees</b> led you in the ships of their rejoicing. This may also be explained as regards the news of the redemption, as follows:
<b>Because of you, I sent</b> I will send the kings of Media to Babylon, and I will lower the Chaldees in ships and oars into exile to the land of Media. And the Chaldees I will lower in ships which their rejoicing was [i.e., the Chaldees would be taken into captivity with the very boats in which they had previously rejoiced].

<b>Neither did you purchase cane for Me with money</b> for incense, for you failed to offer to Me what you should have, and you were attracted to idolatry.)
<b>But you have burdened Me</b> [lit. you have overworked Me.] You have caused Me to be an attendant to pagans, as Ezekiel envisioned (1:4): “And behold a tempest was coming from the north.” For the chariot of the Shechinah was returning from Babylon, where it had gone to conquer the whole world under the domination of Nebuchadnezzar, lest they say that He delivered His children into the hands of an inferior nation, as is found in Hagigah (13b).

<b>And they shall sprout among the grass</b> among Esau (mss. and K’li Paz). [The Jewish nation will grow] through the proselytes who will join them. [The expression,] “among the grass” refers to Esau, for it is stated concerning Edom (supra 34:13): “And it shall be the habitat of jackals, an abode (חָצִיר) for ostriches.” (Editions reading, “Amalek,” are erroneous cf. reference.)

@8
<b>and be not dismayed</b> Heb. תִּרְהוּ. There is no similar word, and its interpretation according to its context is like תֵּחַתּוּ, be not dismayed from making My name known among the heathens (nations [K’li Paz and mss.]).
<b>let you hear</b> from Mount Sinai, and I told you there that there is no God besides Me.
<b>and you are My witnesses</b> that I opened for you seven heavens and showed you that there is no other, and you are My witnesses to this thing that there is no God besides Me.
<b>and there is no rock I did not know</b> Jonathan renders: And there is no strong one unless he is given strength by Me.
<b>I did not know</b> Heb. יָדַעְתִּי. An expression similar to (Exodus 33:17) “And I knew you by name (וָאֵדָעֲךָ)”; (Deut. 2:7) “He knew (יָדַע) your going”; (Hosea 13:5) “I knew you (יְדַעְתִּיךָ) in the desert.”

@11

<b>he fashions it</b> Heb. יִצְּרֵהוּ, an expression of fashioning.
<b>and he made it with his strong arm; yea he is hungry etc.</b> Even he, the fashioner, lacks strength and is weak, for if he becomes hungry he has no strength, or if he does not drink water, he becomes faint immediately. Surely his product has no power to help.
@13
<b>The carpenter</b> And if he comes to make it of wood, and he is a carpenter, the following is his method.
<b>stretched out a line</b> as is the custom of the carpenters, and according to the line, יְתָאֲרֵהוּ בַשֶּׂרֶד, he straightens it with a saw, which they call doloire in French.
<b>he beautifies it</b> Heb. יְתָאֲרֵהוּ, he beautifies it.
<b>he fixes it with planes</b> Heb. מַקְצֻעוֹת. He smoothes it with a plane and a blade. Jonathan renders מַקְצֻעוֹת as אִיזְמֵלַיָּא, knives or blades.
<b>and with a compass he rounds it</b> Heb. יְתָאֳרֵהוּ, an expression similar to (Josh. 15:9): “And the border circled (וְתָאַר).” If he comes to make circular drawings, he draws around it with a compass, compas in French.
<b>like the beauty of a man</b> That is a woman, who is the beauty of her husband.

@20
<b>[To] a provider [made] of ashes, a deceived heart has perverted him</b> His heart, which was deceived, turned him aside to make for himself a provider of ashes. The image, half of which was burned and made into ashes, this fool says that it is his provider and patron. Another explanation: רוֹעֶה אֵפֶר is an expression of companionship. One who worships idols associates himself with the idol, which is ash.

@25
<b>Who stretched forth the heavens alone...Who frustrates the signs of imposters</b> Since I stretched forth the heavens, I can, therefore, frustrate their signs.
<b>imposters</b> Heb. בַּדִּים. They are stargazers, who predict the future through signs of the heavens, and since many times they lie, they are called בַּדִּים, imposters, for I change the heavenly princes, and these who ask of them err, and since the astrologers of Babylon were stargazers, as Scripture states (infra 47:13), “Let them stand now, and let the gazers into the heavens save you.” He, therefore, states that He will frustrate the signs of their imposters, for I am He Who frustrated the signs of the imposters of Egypt.

<b>to His anointed one</b> Every title of greatness is called anointing. Comp. (Num. 18:8) “To you I have given them for greatness (לְמָשְׁחָה).” Our Sages, however, said: To the King Messiah, the Holy One, blessed be He, says, “I complain to you about Cyrus,” as it is stated in Tractate Megillah 12a.
<b>to flatten nations before him</b> Heb. לְרַד, to spread out and to flatten nations before him. לְרַד is equivalent to לְרַדֵּד, to spread out.
<b>and the loins of kings I will loosen</b> This is an expression of weakness and breaking strength, for girding the loins constitutes arming with strength. Comp. (Job 38:3) “Gird up your loins like a mighty man”; (Jer. 1:17) “And you gird up your loins”; (Job 12:21) “And the belt of the mighty He loosens”; an expression of breaking strength.
<b>to open...before him</b> the portals of the gates of Babylon. Gates are the space of the opening of the gate; portals are those with which they open and lock the gate.
@2
<b>and I will straighten out crooked paths</b> Heb. וַהֲדוּרִים אֲיַשֵּׁר. Jonathan renders: I will level the walls. Comp. (Shab. 77b) “the surrounding area (הדר הדרנא),” since the wall surrounds the city. The word may also be explained as: I will straighten out crooked paths before him.

<b>Woe to him who contends with his Creator</b> Isaiah prophesied concerning Habakkuk, who was destined to stand and complain about the length of Nebuchadnezzar’s success (1:2): “How long, O Lord, have I entreated [You]?...” (v. 14) “And [why] have You made man like the fish of the sea?” And the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Isaiah, Why does this one come to contend with Me? Does he think that I do not give thought to save My people? When the time lapses, “that the land will appease its sabbaths” (Lev. 26:34).
<b>has no place</b> [lit. has no hands,] has no place.
@10
<b>Woe to him who says to a father, “What do you beget?”</b> He thinks that he has more pity on the son than his father. Another explanation is: Woe is the son who says to his father, “Why have you begotten?” He is analogous to the one who contends with his Creator.
@11
<b>Ask Me about the signs etc.</b> Heb. הָאוֹתִיוֹת. The ‘heh’ is voweled with a ‘kamatz.’ This indicates that it is not the interrogative, but this is its explanation: If you have come to ask Me, you and the prophets, ask Me about the signs of the heavens and the wonders that you see coming about on the earth; about them you may ask Me, what they are, but about My children and about the work of My hands, Israel, for whose sake I formed everything, shall you come to command Me and to complain before Me?
<b>do you command Me?</b> This is the interrogative. Must you command Me concerning My children? I have already created the salvation for them in the thought that has entered My mind [lit. has come before Me]. How so? I aroused him with righteousness. This is stated regarding Cyrus.
@12
<b>I made the earth</b> and gave it to whoever pleased Me [lit. was straight in My eyes].
@14
<b>The toil of Egypt etc.</b> I have informed how I will save My children from the hand of Babylon, for I have aroused Cyrus for that purpose with My righteousness. I further inform you of the salvation from Sennacherib that will take place in the days of Hezekiah. When he returns (supra 36:36) from marching upon Tirhaka, king of Cush, he will return to Jerusalem with all the valuable treasures of Cush, and Egypt, who will go to aid Cush, in his possession, and he will come with those spoils and fall in Jerusalem, and Hezekiah and his people will plunder everything. So is it delineated in Seder Olam (ch. 23) that it is stated concerning Sennacherib.
<b>men of stature</b> Tall people.
<b>over to you</b> Jerusalem.
<b>they shall come over in chains</b> For Sennacherib brought them there, with neck-irons fastened to them, and after his defeat, Hezekiah stood and released all those captives, who became converted to Judaism and recognized the kingdom of Heaven.
<b>Only in you is God</b> They will acknowledge that there is no God but the Lord alone. ([Mss. and K’li Paz read:] but to Israel.)
@15
<b>Indeed, You are a God Who conceals Himself</b> And so they shall say to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Indeed, You have given us to understand (we understand [Mss. and K’li Paz]) that to collect the debts of Your people, You conceal yourself from showing Your victory. So to speak, You have not the ability, and when Your mercy is aroused, You are the God of Israel, the Savior.” So it is explained in Mechilta (Ex. 14:4).

<b>I am the Lord Who speaks righteousness</b> Since I commenced to speak to them concerning My righteousness, to inform them of the giving of their reward, afterwards I told them things that are right, My statutes and My laws, for before the giving of the Torah it was said to them, “And now, if you heed, etc., you shall be for Me a treasure...a kingdom of priests, etc.” (Ex. 19:5f.).

@24
<b>But to me did He say by the Lord</b> Heb. אַךְ בַה' לִי אָמַר [lit. but by the Lord to me He said]. This verse is inverted, and thus is its interpretation: But to me did He say by the Lord righteousness and strength. Although all the nations shall prostrate themselves before Him [correct reading according to Warsaw edition, K’li Paz, and mss.], but to me alone, the congregation of Israel, has been promised by the Lord righteousness and strength, and other nations shall not be included in my glory.
<b>to Him shall come and be ashamed etc.</b> All who were incensed against the Holy One, blessed be He, shall come to Him to regret what they did in their lifetimes and be ashamed.
<b>all who are incensed</b> Heb. כֹּל הַנֶּחֱרִים בּוֹ, all who are incensed.
@25

<b>Bel squats; Nebo soils himself</b> The deities of Babylon squatted and soiled themselves. This is an expression of ridicule of the idols, like one who suffers from diarrhea and does not manage to sit down on the seat in the privy before he discharges with a splash.
<b>Bel squats; Nebo soils himself</b> Heb. כָּרַע בֵּל קֹרֵס נְבוֹ. Akropid sei Bel; konkiad sei Nebo. Bel squats; Nebo soils himself. So I heard in the name of Rabbenu Gershom, the Light of the Diaspora.
<b>their idols were</b> The images of the forms of Bel and Nebo were to the beasts and the cattle, compared to the beasts and the cattle, which soil and dirty themselves with their droppings.
<b>what you carry is made a load, a burden</b> The feces in their bowels are heavy to bear like a burden for a weary man. Therefore, they soiled themselves and squatted together, the soiling with the squatting.
@2
<b>they could not deliver the burden</b> to discharge the feces in their bowels as others discharge, in the normal manner.
<b>deliver</b> Heb. מַלֵּט, an expression of discharging from an embedded place. Comp. (supra 34:15) “There, the owl has made its nest, and she has laid eggs (וַתְּמַלֵט),” he has discharged her egg. Comp. also (infra 66:7) “And she has been delivered (וְהִמְלִיטָה) of a male child.” Jonathan, however, did not render these verses in this manner.

Since he says regarding their deity, that it is carried and also that it cannot deliver its burden, he says, “But I bear others, and I will deliver My burden.”

<b>[I] call from the east a swift bird</b> Heb. עַיִט. From the land of Aram, which is in the east, I called Abraham to Me to take counsel with Me. עַיִט Comp. (Dan. 2:14) “Answered with counsel (עֵיטָא) and discretion”; (ibid. 6:8) “All the presidents of the kingdom have taken counsel (אִתְיָעֲטוּ).” Alternatively, it can be interpreted as an expression of a bird. I called him to hasten after Me like a bird that flies and wanders from its place.
<b>from a distant land</b> I called My man of counsel, and with him I took counsel between the parts concerning the four exiles, as it is explained in Gen. Rabbah (44:17) “And behold, a fear, great darkness was falling upon him.” [“Fear” refers to Babylon... “Darkness” refers to Media, who darkened the eyes of Israel with fasting. “Great” refers to Greece... “Was falling upon him” refers to Edom..., etc.]

@13
<b>astrologers</b> Heb. הֹבְרֵי שָׁמַיִם. Jonathan renders it like ‘the gazers of the heavens,’ who gaze at the constellations of the heavens. He compares it to (Song 6:10) “Clear (בָּרָה) as the sun,” and to (Job 33: 3) “Spoke a clear (בָּרוּר) word.” And so did Menahem associate it with them (Machbereth Menahem p. 47f.); those who clarify the orbit of the constellations, and he interpreted it thus because the diviners are unable to determine the seconds of the day and the night until the heaven is perfectly clear to them. Micah, too, said in prophecy (3:6), “It has become too dark for you to divine.” This teaches us that on a dark day the stars are sealed, and they cannot divine (ibid. p. 13).
<b>the monthly prognosticators of what will come upon you</b> For when the moon is in its first phase [lit. renewed], they see at the time of its ‘birth’ part of what is destined to come, but they do not know it clearly. Therefore, it is stated, “of what.” Similarly, he says elsewhere (supra 8:19): “who chirp and mutter,” like these birds who chirp and mutter and do not know why.

<b>Hearken to this</b> The two tribes destined to go in exile to Babylon.
<b>O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel</b> That is the tribe of Benjamin, who are not called by the tribe of Judah, but by the general name of the tribes of Israel.
<b>and who emanated from the waters of Judah</b> And the tribe of Judah who emanated and ran from the waters of Judah’s pail, as Scripture states (Num. 24: 7): “Water shall run out of his pails.”
<b>neither in truth</b> As Jeremiah said, (5:2) “And if they say, ‘As the Lord lives,’ surely they swear falsely,” i.e., you were unworthy of being redeemed, but since they were called [as being] from the Holy City, and that caused them not to be exiled with the ten tribes in the time of Sennacherib, to Halah and Habor, for they have no redemption.
@2
<b>and they leaned on the God of Israel</b> in the days of Hezekiah, about whom it is written (2 Kings 18:5): “He trusted in the Lord God of Israel.” That caused them not to be exiled except in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, who exiled them to Babylon, and they had a redemption through Cyrus.
@3
<b>The first things</b> that passed, [viz.] the redemption from Egypt and Hezekiah’s salvation from the hand of Sennacherib.

<b>and they came to pass</b> as I told before through My prophets.
@4
<b>Because of My knowledge that you are obstinate.</b> Heb. מִדַּעְתִּי. Because I knew you, that you are obstinate, and if the miracle would come and I had not told of it before, you would say, “My idol performed them, and they were not from the Holy One, blessed be He.” Therefore, I told you from then; when it had not yet come to pass etc. מִדַּעְתִּי [although usually translated ‘from My knowledge,’ in this case,] ; the ‘mem’ denotes the giving of a reason, like ‘Because I knew.’ A similar form [is found in Deut. 7:8:], “For, because of the Lord’s love (מֵאַהֲבַת) for you, and because of His observing (וּמִשָּׁמְרוֹ) the oath.”

<b>and you did not hear them</b> until this day. The words, “and before the day,” refer back to “I let you hear,” as stated above.
@8
<b>Neither did you hearken</b> Jonathan renders: Neither did you hearken to the words of the prophets, neither did you accept the teaching of the Torah, nor did you bend your ear to the words of the blessings and the curses of My covenant that I established with you at Horeb.
<b>for I knew that you would deal treacherously</b> When I came down to save you from the hands of the Egyptians, it was revealed to Me that you would eventually deal treacherously. Nevertheless, I kept the oath of the Patriarchs. This is what is stated (Ex. 3:7): “I saw the affliction of My people.” [The Hebrew expression for “I saw,” is רָאֹה רָאִיתִי, a double verb form, which denotes] two seeings. I see that they will eventually deal treacherously, but, nevertheless, I saw the affliction of My people. Rabbi Tanhuma expounded it in this manner.
<b>and...transgressor from the womb</b> Since you were in Egypt, as it is related in Ezekiel (20:5): “And I made Myself known in the land of Egypt, etc. (v. 7) and I said to them, [Cast away, each man the abominations of his eyes, and do not contaminate yourselves with the idols of Egypt].”
@9
<b>I defer My anger</b> Heb. (אַאֲרִיךְ אַפִּי). Despite the future form, it is an expression of the present.
<b>and My praise is that I restrain My wrath</b> Heb. אֶחֱטָם. And this is My praise, that I restrain My wrath for you. אֶחֱטָם is an expression of חֹטֶם, a nose. I will close My nose not to allow the smoke of My nostrils to go out and not to be angry with you, for, when one is angry, smoke comes out of his nostrils, as Scripture states (Ps. 18:9): “Smoke rose in His nose.” Likewise, every expression of ‘kindling of anger’ (חֲרוֹן אַף) is an expression of the heating of the nose, (Job. 42:7) “My anger was kindled (חָרָה אַפִּי).” Comp. also (ibid. 30:30) “And my bones were burnt (חָרָה) from heat.” My nose was heated (נִחַר) from much heat.”
@10
<b>but not as silver</b> [lit. but not with silver.] Not with the fire of Gehinnom, as silver is refined through fire.

<b>I even called him</b> [i.e., I called] Cyrus. Others say: The Lord loves Israel. I even called him, [i.e.,] Abraham. This calling is an expression of exaltation, to be My called one. Comp. (Num. 1:16), “These are the called ones of the congregation.”
@16
<b>from the time it was, there was I</b> [Jonathan paraphrases:] From the time the nations ceased fearing Me, there I brought Abraham your father near to My service.
<b>and now, the Lord God has sent me, and His spirit</b> [Jonathan paraphrases:] Said the prophet, “And now, the Lord God has sent me, and His word.” This is an intermingling of words. The one who said this did not say that [i.e., the first part of the verse was said by God, and the second part by the prophet]. And the Aggadic Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (Yithro 21) explains: Hearken to this—This alludes to Moses’ Torah, referred to as “This is the Torah.” In the beginning, I did not speak in secretat Sinai. And the prophet says, “From the time that thing was that, He says, I was there.” And we learned from here that all the prophets stood at Sinai. And now He sent me to prophesy to them. Even in this version there is an intermingling of words. “In the beginning I did not speak in secret,” was said by the Shechinah. “From the time it was, there was I,” was said by the prophet. It is possible to interpret it so that there should not be intermingling of words [as follows:] Draw near to me, hearken to this what I prophesy to you regarding the downfall of Babylon and your redemption. In the beginning I did not speak that in secret. From the time it was, that the Holy One, blessed be He, decreed to bring it, there I was. This teaches that from the time of the decree, the Holy One, blessed be He, appoints the prophet who is destined to prophesy regarding the matter in the council of the heavenly household, although it has not yet been created.

He is Abraham your forefather. And who is the hole? She is Sarah who bore you. [תְּחוֹלֶלְכֶם means] ‘who bore you,’ an expression similar to (infra 66: 8) “For Zion experienced pangs (חָלָה) and also bore.”

This is an expression similar to “the sailors of (מַלָּחֵי) the sea,” who stir the water with the oars that guide the ship. Comp. also (Ex. 30:35) “Stirred (מְמֻלָּח), pure, and holy.”
<b>and the earth</b> the rulers of the earth.
<b>and its inhabitants</b> the rest of the people.
<b>and My salvation</b> for My people shall be forever. Another explanation is: [It refers] actually [to] the heavens and the earth, and this is its explanation: Raise your eyes and look at the heaven and at the earth, and see how strong and sturdy they are, yet they shall rot away, but My righteousness and My salvation shall be forever. Hence, My righteousness is sturdier and stronger than they.

<b>What must be poured out hastened to be opened</b> Heb. מִהַר צֹעֶה לְהִפָּתֵחַ. Even if his stools are hard, and he must be opened by walking in order to move the bowels in order that he not die by destruction, and once he hastens to open up, he requires much food, for, if his bread is lacking, even he will die. צֹעֶה An expression of a thing prepared to be poured, as he says concerning Moab, whom the prophet compared to wine (Jer. 48:11): “Who rests on his dregs and was not poured from vessel to vessel.” And he says there (v. 12), “And I will send pourers (צֹעִים) upon him and they shall pour him out (וְצֵעֻהוּ), and they shall empty his vessels.” [This is an illustration of the weakness of man. Consequently, there is no need to fear him.] Another explanation is: מִהַר צֹעֶה That enemy who oppresses you, who is now with girded loins, girded with strength, shall hasten to be opened up and to become weak. צֹעֶה Girded. Comp. (infra 63:1) “Girded (צֹעֶה) with the greatness of His strength.”

@17
<b>dregs</b> Heb. קֻבַּעַת. Jonathan renders: פַּיְלֵי, which is the name of a cup [phiala in Latin]. But it appears to me that קֻבַּעַת, these are the dregs fixed (קְבוּעִים) to the bottom of the vessel, and the word מָצִית, “you have drained,” indicates it, as it is said (Ps. 75:9): “...shall drain (יִמְצוּ) its dregs.”
<b>weakness</b> Heb. תַּרְעֵלָה. That is a drink that clogs and weakens the strength of a person, like one bound, tied, and enwrapped. Comp.

<b>for...goes before you</b> Two things at the end of this verse explain two things in its beginning, [viz.] For not with haste shall you go forth. What is the reason? For the Lord goes before you to lead you on the way, and one whose agent advances before him to lead him on the way his departure is not in haste. And not in the flurry of flight shall you go, for your rear guard is the God of Israel. He will follow you to guard you from any pursuer. Comp. (Num. 10:25) “And the division of the camp of Dan shall travel, the rear guard of all the camps.” Whoever goes after the camp is called מְאַסֵּף, the rear guard, because he waits for the stragglers and the stumblers. Similarly, Scripture states in Joshua (6: 13): “And the rear guard was going after the Ark.”

<b>Despised and rejected by men</b> was he. So is the custom of this prophet: he mentions all Israel as one man, e.g., (44:2), “Fear not, My servant Jacob”; (44:1) “And now, hearken, Jacob, My servant.” Here too (52:13), “Behold My servant shall prosper,” he said concerning the house of Jacob. יַשְׂכִּיל is an expression of prosperity. Comp. (I Sam. 18:14) “And David was successful (מַשְׂכִּיל) in all his ways.”
<b>and as one who hides his face from us</b> Because of their intense shame and humility, they were as one who hides his face from us, with their faces bound up in concealment, in order that we not see them, like a plagued man who hides his face and is afraid to look.
@4
<b>Indeed, he bore our illnesses</b> Heb. אָכֵן, an expression of ‘but’ in all places. But now we see that this came to him not because of his low state, but that he was chastised with pains so that all the nations be atoned for with Israel’s suffering. The illness that should rightfully have come upon us, he bore.

@9
<b>And he gave his grave to the wicked</b> He subjected himself to be buried according to anything the wicked of the heathens (nations [mss., K’li Paz]) would decree upon him, for they would penalize him with death and the burial of donkeys in the intestines of the dogs.
<b>to the wicked</b> According to the will of the wicked, he was willing to be buried, and he would not deny the living God.
<b>and to the wealthy with his kinds of death</b> and to the will of the ruler he subjected himself to all kinds of death that he decreed upon him, because he did not wish to agree to (denial) [of the Torah] to commit evil and to rob like all the heathens (nations [mss., K’li Paz]) among whom he lived.
<b>and there was no deceit in his mouth</b> to accept idolatry (to accept a pagan deity as God [Parshandatha]).
@10
<b>And the Lord wished to crush him, He made him ill</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, wished to crush him and to cause him to repent; therefore, he made him ill.
<b>If his soul makes itself restitution, etc.</b> Said the Holy One, blessed be He, “I will see, if his soul will be given and delivered with My holiness to return it to Me as restitution for all that he betrayed Me, I will pay him his recompense, and he will see children, etc.” This word אָשָׁם is an expression of ransom that one gives to the one against when he sinned, amende in O.F., to free from faults, similar to the matter mentioned in the episode of the Philistines (I Sam. 6:3), “Do not send it away empty, but you shall send back with it a guilt offering (אָשָׁם).”

And some interpret it as an expression of a sun (שֶׁמֶשׁ), windows through which the sun shines, and they make opposite it a barrier of kinds of colored glass for beauty, and Midrash Psalms interprets שִׁמְשׁוֹתַיִךְ as well as שֶׁמֶשׁ וּמָגֵן (Ps. 84:12) as “the pinnacles of the wall.”
<b>of carbuncle stones</b> Heb. אֶקְדָּח. Jonathan renders: of gomer stones. Gumrin is the Aramaic translation of גֶּחָלִים, coals. He interprets אֶקְדָּח as an expression similar to (supra 50: 11) “who kindle (קֹדְחֵי) fire,” and they are a type of stones that burn like torches and that is the carbuncle (karbokle in O.F.), an expression of a coal. Others interpret it as an expression of a drill, i.e., huge stones of which the entire opening of the doorway is drilled, and the doorposts, the threshold, and the lintel are all hewn from the stone.
<b>of precious stones</b> Desirable stones [from Jonathan].

<b>go far away from oppression</b> [Although grammatically this is the imperative, here it is the future,] like (supra 52:2) “Shake yourself from the dust.” You will be far away from those who oppress you. Printed editions of Rashi contain the following addendum: (
<b>go far away from oppression</b> You will stay far from oppressing other peoples in the manner the wicked do, that they accumulate money through robbery, but you will not need to rob, for you will not fear poverty or straits, or ruin, for it shall neither come nor shall it approach you. [Abarbanel]) (
<b>With righteousness</b> that you will perform, you will be established with an everlasting redemption, and you will be far from people’s oppression for you will not fear; you will not even have terror or fear of them, and you will be far from ruin, for it will not come near you.

<b>whoever mobilizes against you</b> Heb. גָר. Whoever mobilizes against you for war. Alternatively, מִי גָר [means:] whoever contends with you (וְנִתְגָּרֶה). And our Rabbis explained it as referring to the proselytes (גֵּרִים), [i.e.,] to say that we will not accept proselytes in Messianic times. And even according to the simple meaning of the verse it is possible to explain: whoever became sojourners with you in your poverty, shall dwell with you in your wealth. Comp.

(Lam. 2:19) “humbled (הָעֲטוּפִים) with hunger,” “when the small child and the suckling are humbled (בֵּעָטֵף).” And the souls which I made.
<b>when a spirit from before Me</b> Heb. כִּי. This instance of the word כִּי is used as an expression of “when.” Comp. (infra 58:7) “When you see (כִּי תִרְאֶה)”; (Deut. 26:1) “When you come (כִּי תָבוֹא).” That is to say, when his spirit is humbled, and he is humbled, I terminate My quarrel and My anger from upon him.

<b>For the iniquity of his thievery</b> Heb. בִּצְעוֹ, his thievery.
<b>I became wroth</b> at the beginning and I smote him, always hiding My face from his distress and I was wroth for he went rebelliously in the way of his heart. Transpose the verse and explain it thus: For the iniquity of his thievery and the fact that he went rebelliously in the way of his heart, I became wroth and smote him.

<b>like the turbulent sea</b> This seaits waves raise themselves high and strive to go out of the boundary of sand that I made as a boundary for the sea, and when it reaches there, against its will it breaks. The next wave sees all this, yet does not turn back. Similarly, the wicked man sees his friend being punished for his wickedness; yet he does not turn back. Also, just as the sea has its mud and its offensive matter on its mouth, [i.e., on its surface,] so do the wicked have their offensive matter in their mouth; e.g., Pharaoh said, (Exodus 5:2) “Who is the Lord?” Sennacherib said (supra 36:20), “Who are they among all the Gods of the lands...?” Nebuchadnezzar said, (supra 14:14) “I will liken myself to the Most High.”

<b>Will you call this a fast</b> Heb. הֲלָזֶה. An interrogative form. Therefore, the ‘hey’ is punctuated with a ‘hataf-pattah.’

<b>and...spider webs</b> Irajjne in O.F., spider, and קוּרֵי is ordiojjrs in O.F., warp. קוּרֵי are the implements of the weaver, those upon which the warp is mounted. Menahem (Machbereth Menahem p. 158) classifies it in the class of קוֹרוֹת, beams, since the spider mounts the warp of his weavings on beams.
<b>and what hatches</b> Heb. וְהַזּוּרֶה. Jonathan renders: וּמְשַׁחְנָן, an expression of warming, called in O.F. kover [couve], hatching when one warms them, it emerges from them when he cracks the shell. The original meaning of וְהַזּוּרֶה is an expression of pressing to extract what is absorbed within. Comp. (Jud. 6:38) “And pressed (וַיָּזַר) the fleece.” The pressing of this one is its hatching.
<b>viper</b> Heb. אֶפְעֶה, a species of snake that is harmful, so will nothing result from their deeds but evil.

@10
<b>in dark places</b> Heb. בָּאַשְׁמַנִּים. Menahem (Machbereth, p. 35) interpreted it as an expression of dark places, and most exegetes concur with him. Dunash, however, (Tesuhvoth Dunash, p. 93) interprets it as an expression of fat (שׁוּמָן), with the ‘alef’ prefixed to it like the ‘alef’ that is in (Job 13:17) אַחְוָתִי, “my narrative,” [derived from חוה]; and that is in (Jer. 15:18) אַכְזָב, “a failure,” (derived from כזב ; and (Num. 21:1) “the way of the spies (הָאֲתָרִים),” [derived from תור]. Here, too, among the שְׁמֵנִים, among the lusty living, we are like dead. And Jonathan rendered it as an expression of locking: It is locked before us as the graves are locked before the dead.

<b>sprouting and giving forth</b> Heb. הֹרוֹ וְהֹגוֹ to shoot and to give forth. הֹרוֹ is an expression of (Ex. 15:4) “He shot (יָרָה) into the sea.” (Another explanation: הֹרוֹ means: the teacher and the disciple, a gerund.) הֹגוֹ is an expression of (II Sam. 20:13) “When he was removed (הֹגָה) from the highway”; (Prov. 25:4) “Take away (הָגוֹ) the dross from the silver.”
@14
<b>And justice has turned away backwards</b> Our revenge from our enemies, which depends upon the Holy One, blessed be He, and His righteousness stands from afar. Why? For truth has stumbled in our streets, [and since truth has stumbled from the earth, even from heaven righteousness and justice do not come.]
@15
<b>is considered mad</b> Heb. מִשְׁתּוֹלֵל, considered mad by the people. Comp. (Micah 1:8) “I will go as a mad man (שׁוֹלָל).” This is equivalent to שׁוֹגֵג, inadvertent, which the Targum renders: שָׁלוּ. Likewise (II Sam. 6:7), “For his error (הַשַּׁל).”
<b>and was displeased for there is no justice</b> Therefore, He brought retribution upon them.
@16
<b>And He saw that there was no man</b> And now, when He repents of the evil to His people, He sees that there is no righteous man to stand in the breach.
<b>and He was astounded</b> He was silent to see whether there was an intercessor, and there was no intercessor. וַיִּשְׁתּוֹמֵם is an expression of a man who stands and wonders and remains silent in his wonder, and the ‘tav’ of וַיִּשְׁתּוֹמֵם is like the ‘tav’ of מִשְׁתּוֹלֵל, and both of them serve here as the reflexive, and this is the procedure of the word whose first radical is a ‘shin’ or a ‘samech,’ that when it is converted into the form of מִתְפָּעֵל, the present reflexive, נִתְפָּעֵל, the past reflexive, or יִתְפָּעֵל, the future reflexive, the ‘tav’ comes in the middle of the letters of the radical. The result is that וַיִּשְׁתּוֹמֵם is an expression from the same root as (Jer. 2:12) “Be admonished (שֹׁמּוּ), O ye heavens”; (Ezekiel 3:15) “appalled (מַשְׁמִים) among them”; (Job 18:20) “the later ones will be astonished (נָשַׁמּוּ),” an expression of wonder.

<b>Who is this coming from Edom</b> The prophet prophesies concerning what the Holy One, blessed be He, said that He is destined to wreak vengeance upon Edom, and He, personally, will slay their heavenly prince, like the matter that is said (supra 34:5), “For My sword has become sated in the heaven.” And afterward, (ibid.) “it shall descend upon Edom,” and it is recognizable by the wrath of His face that He has slain [them with] a great massacre, and the prophet is speaking in the expression of the wars of human beings, dressed in clothes, and when they slay a slaying, the blood spatters on their garments, for so is the custom of Scripture; it speaks of the Shechinah anthropomorphically, to convey to the ear what it can hear. Comp. (Ezek. 43:2) “His voice is like the voice of many waters.” The prophet compares His mighty voice to the voice of many waters to convey to the ear according to what it is possible to hear, for one cannot understand and hearken to the magnitude of the mighty of our God to let us hear it as it is.
<b>Who is this coming from Edom</b> Israel says, “Who is this, etc.?” And He is coming with soiled garments, colored with blood, and anything repugnant because of its smell and its appearance fits to the expression of חִמּוּץ, soiling.
<b>from Bozrah</b> Our Rabbis said (see Makkoth 12a): “The heavenly prince of Edom is destined to commit two errors. He thinks that Bozrah is identical with Bezer in the desert, which was a refuge city. He will also err insofar as it affords refuge only for inadvertent murder, but he killed Israel intentionally.” There is also an Aggadic midrash (see above 34:6) that because Bozrah supplied a king for Edom when its first king died, as in Gen. (36:33), “And Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his stead,” and Bozrah is of Moab, according to the matter that is stated (Jer. 48:24): “Upon Kerioth and upon Bozrah.”
<b>this one</b> who was stately in His attire, צֹעֶה, and girded with the greatness of His strength. And the Holy One, blessed be He, replies to him, ‘It is I, upon Whom the time has come to speak of the righteousness of the Patriarchs, and of the righteousness of the generation of religious persecution, and My righteousness, too, is with them, and I have revealed Myself as being great to save.’ And they say, ‘Why is your clothing red?

<b>As fire burns</b> something that melts because of it, and as fire causes water to bubble; when you put a coal or glowing metal into water, the water bubbles. All this You did in Egypt, as it is written (Ex. 9: 24): “And there was hail, and fire burning in the midst of the hail.” Jonathan, however, renders: “As fire burned materials that melt,” in reference to Elijah on Mount Carmel, concerning whom it is stated (I Kings 18:38): “and the water which was in the trench, it licked up.”
<b>to make Your name known to Your adversaries</b> like the matter that is stated concerning that plague (Ex. 9:16): “But, because of this I preserved You, [in order to show you My strength, and in order to tell of My name throughout the entire land.]” Had You done this now, then nations would quake from before You.
@2
<b>When You performed</b> against the Egyptians and against all the adversaries awesome deeds, that we did not hope You would perform all those awesome deeds, for we were unworthy of them.
<b>You descended</b> to Mount Sinai, then mountains dripped from before You. In this manner, Dunash son of Labrat explained it.
@3
<b>And whereof no one had ever heard</b> like those awesome deeds performed for one of all the nations before that, and no eye had ever seen another god besides You, that the god would do for him who hoped for him what You did for him who hoped for You. I heard this from Rabbi Jose, and it pleased me. ([Manuscripts yield:]
<b>And whereof no one had ever heard</b> like those awesome deeds performed for one of all the nations before that, neither had an eye seen God, besides your eyes, what He would do for one who hoped for Him. Another explanation is:
<b>No eye had seen</b> that a god besides You should perform miracles for him who hoped for him, as You do for those who hope for You. From Rabbi Joseph I heard this. Our Rabbis, however, who stated (Ber. 34a): “None of the prophets prophesied except regarding the Messianic era, but the World to Come, ‘no eye saw etc.,’” expounded its meaning in the following manner: No prophet’s eye saw what the Holy One, blessed be He, will do for him who hopes for Him except Your eyes, You, O God.
@4
<b>You smote him who rejoiced and worked righteousness</b> Heb. פָּגַעְתָּ. Comp. (I Kings 2:34) “and he fell (וַיִּפְגַּע) upon him and slew him.” You removed from us and slew the righteous, who would rejoice to work righteousness, and with the ways of Your mercies, they would mention You in their prayer.
<b>behold,...You</b> When You became wroth with us for all that we would sin.
<b>through them</b> of old we were saved; with their prayer. [Rashi according to Parshandatha; Printed editions are erroneous.]
<b>we would be saved</b> A present tense [i.e., a continual procedure.]
@5
<b>And we all have become like one unclean</b> since the righteous have departed from us.
<b>and like a discarded garment</b> Heb. עַדִּים. [Jonathan renders:] and like a discarded garment, like a rejected garment, which all say, ‘Remove.’ עִדִּים is the Aramaic translation of removal.
<b>and we...have withered like a leaf</b> Heb. וַנָּבֶל, and we have withered like a leaf; fletrire in French.
<b>and our iniquities carry us away like the wind</b> [Jonathan renders:] And with our sins we were carried away like the wind.

<b>and You caused us to wander</b> Heb. וַתְּמוּגֵנוּ, You caused us to wander.
@11
<b>will You remain silent and afflict us</b> Will You remain silent concerning what is done to us? Until here is the prophet’s prayer. Its beginning is (supra 63:7) “The kind acts of the Lord I will mention.”

@1
<b>I allowed Myself to be sought by those who did not ask</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, replies to him, It is impossible not to avenge Myself on them, for I allowed Myself to be sought by them by reproving them through My prophets, but they did not ask.
<b>I said, “Here I am; here I am!”</b> Return to Me, and I am ready to accept you.
<b>to a nation not called by My name</b> That did not wish to be called by My name.

@3
<b>those who sacrifice in gardens</b> They erect idols in their gardens, and there they burn incense on the bricks.
@4
<b>They sit among the graves</b> so that a spirit of defilement of demons should rest upon them.
<b>and with corpses</b> Heb. וּבַנְּצוּרִים. They are the bodies of the dead, who are as placed in a siege (מָצוֹר), unable to get out.
<b>and broth of abominations</b> Heb. מְרַק, despicable broth. Comp. (Jud. 6:20) “And the broth (הַמָּרָק) pour out.”
@5
<b>Those who say</b> to the righteous, קְרַב אֵלֶיךָ, “Keep to yourself and do not come near me.”
<b>for I am holier than you</b> Heb. כִּי קְדַשְׁתִּיךָ. For I am holier and purer than you. In this manner Jonathan renders.
<b>these</b> abominations that they committed are as smoke, wrath in My nostrils.
@6
<b>Behold it is inscribed</b> Their sin is inscribed before Me, and their sentence has already been decreed and sealed.
@7
<b>Your iniquities</b> Yours and your forefathers’ together I will recompense you.
@8
<b>As when wine is found in the cluster</b> Jonathan renders: As Noah was found innocent in the generation of the Flood.
<b>the wine</b> This is Noah, who was sweet.
<b>in the cluster</b> Heb. בָּאֶשְׁכּוֹל. In the bereft (הַמְשֻׁכָּל) generation. This may also be interpreted according to its apparent meaning.
<b>for the sake of My servants</b> For the sake of every righteous man found among them.
@10
<b>the Sharon</b> The name of a region in the land of Israel.
<b>and the Valley of Achor</b> As its apparent meaning.
@11
<b>who forsake the Lord</b> The wicked of Israel who adopted paganism and died in their wickedness.
<b>who set a table for Gad</b> The name of a pagan deity on the name of the zodiac, and in the language of the mishnah, (Shabbath 67b) “May my fate be lucky (גָד גַּדִּי) and not fatigued.”
<b>for a number</b> Heb. לַמְנִי . According to the number of the computation of the priests, they would fill basins of mingled wine.
<b>mingled wine</b> Heb. מִמְסָךְ, wine mingled with water as was customary. Comp. (Prov. 23:30) “To search for mingled wine (מִמְסָךְ).” Also (ibid. 9:2), “She mingled (מָסְכָה) her wine.” Some interpret לַמְנִי, to the pagan deities that you appointed (מִנִּיתֶם) over yourselves, but וּמָנִיתִי אֶתְכֶם, which is not punctuated וּמִנִּיתִי with a ‘dagesh,’ indicates that it is an expression of counting.
@13
<b>My servants</b> The righteous [of Israel].
<b>but you</b> who rebel against Me.
@15
<b>your name for an oath</b> From your name shall be taken a curse and an oath for generations, “If it does not befall me as it befell So-and-so.”
<b>and...shall slay you</b> an eternal death.
<b>but to His servants He shall call another name</b> A good name and a mention for a blessing.
@16
<b>For whoever blesses himself on the earth</b> For My fear shall be over all of them, and the earth shall be full of knowledge, and whoever praises himself or lauds himself on the earth, will bless himself by the true God, he will praise himself that he is a servant of the true God, the God of truth, Who realized and observed this, His promise.
<b>for the first troubles have been forgotten</b> Therefore, they shall call Me the true God.
@17
<b>new heavens</b> The princes above shall be renewed, and the princes of Israel shall be the upper princes and the princes of the heathens (the nations [Parshandatha]) will be lower, and so on the earth. ([K’li Paz reads:] The princes above shall be renewed, to raise up the humble and to humble the high ones, and so on the earth.) And some say that there will actually be new heavens, and that is correct, for Scripture proves it (infra 66:22): “For as the new heavens, etc.”
@20
<b>a youth</b> Heb. עוּל יָמִים, a youth. Comp. (Lam. 2:11) “young children (עוֹלֵל).” [Hence,] עוּל יָמִים means young in years.
<b>who is one hundred years old shall die</b> He shall be subject to punishments to be liable to death for a capital sin. So it is explained in Gen. Rabbah (26:2).
<b>shall be cursed</b> for a sin requiring an anathema.
@22
<b>like the days of the tree</b> Jonathan renders: the tree of life.
@25
<b>shall eat straw</b> and will not have to destroy animals.
<b>and a serpent</b> Indeed, dust is his food, which is always available for him. And the Midrash Aggadah explains: And a lion, like cattle, shall eat straw. Since we find that Esau will fall into the hands of the sons of Joseph, as it is said (Obadiah 18): “The house of Esau shall become stubble, and the house of Joseph a flame etc.” But [that they should fall] into the hands of the remaining tribes, who were compared to beasts, we do not find. It is, therefore, stated: “And a lion, like cattle, shall eat straw.” Those tribes that were compared to a lion, such as Judah and Dan, like Joseph, who was compared to an ox, shall devour Esau who was compared to straw.

<b>The heavens are My throne</b> I do not need your Temple.
<b>which is the house</b> that is fitting for My Shechinah.
@2
<b>And all these</b> The heavens and the earth, and for this reason I confined My Shechinah among you when you obeyed Me, for so is My wont, to look at one poor and of crushed spirit, who hastens to do My bidding. But now, I have no desire for you, for whoever slaughters an ox, has smitten its owner and robbed him of it. Therefore, whoever slaughters a lamb seems to Me as one who beheads a dog, and whoever offers up a meal offering is before Me like swine blood, and מַזְכִּיר, he who burns incense. Comp. (Lev. 5:12) “its memorial part (אַזְכָּרָתָהּ).” Also (ibid. 24:7), “and it shall be for the bread as a memorial (לְאַזְכָּרָה).”
@3
<b>brings a gift of violence</b> Heb. מְבָרֵךְ, blesses Me with a gift of violence, brings a gift of violence. This is its explanation, and the expression of בְּרָכָה applies to a gift that is for a reception. Comp. (Gen. 33: 11) “Please take my gift (בִּרְכָתִי).” Also (supra 36:16), “Make peace (בְרָכָה) with me and come out to me.”
<b>they, too, chose their ways</b> They desire these evil ways, and I, too, will choose and desire their mockeries. Now if you ask the meaning of גַּם, too, so is the style of the Hebrew language to say twice גַּם one next to the other. Comp. (Deut. 32:25) “Both a young man and a virgin (גַּם בָּחוּר גַּם בְּתוּלָה)”; (I Kings 3:26) “neither mine nor yours (גַּם לִי גַּם לָךְ)”; (Ecc. 9:1) “neither love nor hate (גַּם אַהֲבָה גַּם שִׂנְאָה)”; (Num. 18:3) “and neither they nor you shall die (גַּם הֵם גַּם אַתֶּם).” Here, too, both they chose and I will choose.
@4
<b>their mockeries</b> Heb. בְּתַעֲלוּלֵיהֶם, to mock them, an expression like (ibid. 22:29) “For you mocked (הִתְעַלַּלְתְּ) me.”
<b>and their fears</b> What they fear.
<b>since I called</b> Hearken and return to Me.
<b>and no one answered</b> saying, “I heard.”
@5
<b>who quake at His word</b> The righteous who hasten with quaking to draw near to His words.
<b>Your brethren...said</b> The transgressors of Israel mentioned above. Another explanation:
<b>Your brethren... who cast you out, said</b> Who said to you (Lam. 4:15), “Turn away, unclean one.”
<b>who hate you, who cast you out</b> Who say (supra 65:5), “Keep to yourself, do not come near me.” [Because of the confusion, we quote other readings. Some manuscripts, as well as K’li Paz, read:]
<b>Your brethren... said</b> The transgressors of Israel mentioned above.
<b>who hate you, who cast you out</b> who say (supra 65: 5), “Keep to yourself, do not come near me.” Another explanation:
<b>Your brethren...said</b> The children of Esau.
<b>who cast you out</b> Who said to you (Lam. 4:15), “Turn away, unclean one.”
<b>For the sake of my name, the Lord shall be glorified</b> With our greatness, the Holy One, blessed be He, is glorified, for we are closer to Him than you are.
<b>but we will see your joy</b> The prophet says, But it is not so as their words, for “we will see your joy, and they shall be ashamed.” Why? For sound a sound of their stirring has come before the Holy One, blessed be He, from what they did in His city, and a sound emanates from His Temple and accuses those who destroyed it, and then the voice of the Lord, recompensing His enemies.
@7
<b>When she has not yet travailed</b> When Zion has not yet travailed with birth pangs, she has borne her children; that is to say that her children will gather into her midst, which was desolate and bereft of them, and it is as though she bore them now without birth pangs, for all the nations will bring them into her midst.
<b>she has been delivered of a male child</b> Heb. וְהִמְלִיטָה. Any emerging of an embedded thing is called הַמְלָטָה. And הַמְלָטָה is esmoucer, or eschamocier in O.F., to allow to escape.
@8
<b>Is a land born in one day?</b> Can a pain come to a woman in confinement to bear a land full of sons in one day?
@9
<b>Will I bring to the birth stool and not cause to give birth</b> Will I bring a woman to the birth stool and not open her womb to bring out her fetus? That is to say, Shall I commence a thing and not be able to complete it? Am I not the One Who causes every woman in confinement to give birth, and now will I shut the womb? This is a question.
@11
<b>from the breast</b> Heb. מִשֹּׁד, an expression of breasts (שָׁדַיִם).
<b>you drink deeply</b> Heb. תָּמֹצּוּ, sucer in French, to suck.
<b>from her approaching glory</b> Heb. מִזִּיז. From the great glory that is moving and coming nearer to her. זִיז means esmoviment in O.F., movement.

@15
<b>shall come with fire</b> With the fury of fire He shall come upon the wicked.
<b>to render</b> Heb. לְהָשִׁיב, [lit. to return] to His adversaries with fury His anger.
@16
<b>For with fire</b> of Gehinnom will the Lord contend with His adversaries, and since He is the plaintiff and the judge, the expression of contending is appropriate for Him, for He, too, presents His claim to find their iniquity and their transgression. Comp. (Ezekiel 38:22) “And I will contend with him (וְנִשְׁפַּטְתִּי)”; (Jer. 2:35) “Behold, I contend with you.” It is an expression of debate. Derajjsner in O.F. [And its simple meaning is: For with the fire of the Lord and with His sword, all flesh shall be judged. Similarly, there are many inverted verses in Scriptures.]
@17
<b>Those who prepare themselves</b> Heb. הַמִּתְקַדְּשִׁים. Those who prepare themselves, “Let you and me go on such-and-such a day to worship such-and-such an idol.”
<b>to the gardens</b> where they plant vegetables, and there they would erect idols.
<b>[one] after one</b> As Jonathan renders: a company after a company. They prepare themselves and purify themselves to worship, one company after its fellow has completed its worship.
<b>in the middle</b> In the middle of the garden. Such was their custom to erect it.
@18
<b>And I - their deeds and their thoughts have come etc.</b> And I What am I to do? Their deeds and their thoughts have come to Me. And that forces Me to gather all the heathens (nations [Mss. and K’li Paz]), and to let them know that their deeds are vanity and the thoughts they are thinking, “For the sake of my name, the Lord shall be glorified,” let them understand that it is false. And where is the gathering? It is the gathering that Zechariah prophesied (14:2): “And I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem.”
<b>and they shall see My glory</b> When I wage war with them with the plague of the following description (ibid. 14:12): “Their flesh shall disintegrate...and their eyes...and their tongue.”
@19
<b>And I will place a sign upon them etc.</b> Refugees will survive the war, and I will allow them to remain in order to go to report to the distant islands My glory that they saw in the war, and also upon those refugees I will place one of the signs with which their colleagues were punished, in order to let the distant ones know that with this plague, those who gathered about Jerusalem were smitten.
@20
<b>and with covered wagons</b> Heb. וּבַצַּבִּים. These are wagons equipped with partitions and a tent. Comp. (Num. 7:3) “Six covered wagons (עֶגְלוֹתצָב).”
<b>and with joyous songs</b> Heb. וּבַכִּרְכָּרוֹת. With a song of players and dancers. Comp. (II Sam. 6:14) “And David danced (מְכַרְכֵּר),” treper in O.F. [Menahem (p. 109) explains it as an expression meaning a lamb. Comp. (supra 16:1) “Send lambs (כַּר) of the ruler of the land.”]
<b>as...bring</b> an offering in a pure vessel for acceptance, so will they bring your brethren as an acceptable offering.
@21
<b>And from them too</b> From the peoples bringing them and from those brought, I will take priests and Levites, for they are now assimilated among the heathens (nations [Mss. and K’li Paz]) under coercion, and before Me the priests and the Levites among them are revealed, and I will select them from among them, and they shall minister before Me, said the Lord. Now where did He say it? (Deut. 29:28) “The hidden things are for the Lord our God.” In this manner it is explained in the Aggadah of Psalms (87:6).
@24
<b>their worm</b> The worm that consumes their flesh.
<b>and their fire</b> in Gehinnom.
<b>and abhorring</b> Heb. דֵרָאוֹן, an expression of contempt. Jonathan, however, renders it as two words: enough (דֵּי) seeing (רְאִיָה), until the righteous say about them, We have seen enough.

@1
<b>The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah</b> Let the son of the corrupt woman, whose deeds are proper Jeremiah was descended from Rahab the harlot and let him reprove the son of the righteous woman whose deeds are corrupt these are Israel who corrupted their deeds who are descended from legitimate seed.

<b>And he was in the days of Jehoiakim</b> And he was a prophet all the remaining days of Josiah, the days of his son Jehoiakim, and the days of his son Zedekiah, until the end of the eleventh year that is the year until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
@5
<b>When I had not yet formed you in the womb, etc.</b> Since the days of the first man. The Holy One, blessed be He, showed Adam each generation and its prophets.
<b>I...formed you</b> Heb. אצרך, an expression of צורה, a form.
<b>I knew you</b> connois toi in O.F. Comp. (Exodus 6:3), “I was not known (נודעתּי) to them.”
<b>I appointed you</b> I appointed you for this.
<b>a prophet to the nations</b> To Israel, who behave like the nations. In this manner it is expounded in Sifrei on the verse: “A prophet from your midst, etc.” (Deut. 18:15), will set up for you and not for those who deny the Torah. How then do I fulfill “A prophet to the nations I made you”? To the children of Israel who deport themselves with the customs of the nations. It can further be interpreted: “A prophet for the nations,” like “About the nations,” to give them to drink the cup of poison, to prophesy retribution upon them, as it is said: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand, you shall give all the nations to drink of it” (infra 25:15). Another explanation of “When you had not yet emerged from the womb I appointed you” is: Concerning you I said to Moses: “I will set up a prophet...like you” (Deut. 18:18). This one reproved them, and this one reproved them. This one prophesied for forty years and this one prophesied for forty years.
@6
<b>Alas</b> This is an expression of wailing (konpljjnt in O.F.).
<b>for I am a youth</b> I am not worthy to reprove them. Moses reproved them shortly before his death, when he was already esteemed in their eyes through the many miracles that he had performed for them. He had taken them out of Egypt, split the Reed Sea for them, brought down the manna, caused the quails to fly, given them the Torah, brought up the well. I come to reprove them at the beginning of my mission.
@7
<b>wherever I send you</b> to the heathens.
<b>and whatever I command you</b> to Israel, you shall speak.
@9
<b>And the Lord stretched forth His hand</b> Every sending mentioned concerning a hand is an expression of stretching forth. Another explanation is like the Targum: And the Lord sent the words of His prophecy.
@10
<b>I have appointed you</b> I have appointed you over the heathens.
<b>to uproot and to crush</b> (depayser in French, to uproot) and over Israel to build and to plant if they heed. So did Jonathan paraphrase it.
@11
<b>a rod of an almond tree</b> (amendleer in O.F.) Jonathan, however, renders: A King who hastens to do evil.
@12
<b>You have seen well</b> This almond tree hastens to blossom before all other trees. I, too, hasten to perform My word. And the Midrash Aggadah (Ecc. Rabbah 12:8) explains: An almond tree takes twenty-one days from its blossoming until it is completely ripe, as the number of days between the seventeenth of Tammuz, when the city was broken into, until the ninth of Ab, when the Temple was burnt.

<b>I remember to you</b> Were you to return to Me, I would desire to have mercy on you for I remember the loving kindness of your youth and the love of the nuptials of your wedding canopy, when I brought you into the wedding canopy, and this (כלולתיך) is an expression of bringing in. Your nuptials (Noces in O.F.). Now what was the loving kindness of your youth? Your following My messengers, Moses and Aaron, from an inhabited land to the desert without provisions for the way since you believed in Me.
@3
<b>Israel is holy</b> like terumah.
<b>the first of His grain</b> Like the first of the harvest before the Omer, which it is forbidden to eat, and whoever eats it is liable, so will all those who eat him be guilty. So did Jonathan render it.
@6
<b>And they did not say, Where is the Lord</b> that we should follow other gods?
<b>plains</b> Heb. ערבה (planure in O.F.), related to pianoro in Old Italian, meaning ‘a plateau.’

<b>and send to Kedar</b> And send to Kedar to see their custom.
<b>and consider diligently</b> And put your heart to it to consider the matter diligently.
<b>whether</b> Heb. הן, like אם, if. Whether either of those nations exchanged its god although they are no gods, yet My nation exchanged their glory, with which they were honored. The Kittites and the Kedarites were tent dwellers and cattle herders, who would travel, go, and wander from pasture to pasture and from desert to desert, and they carry their gods with them to the place where they encamp. But I carried you until I established you, yet you forsook Me. This is how Jonathan paraphrased it. Our Sages said however: The Kittites worshipped water and the Kedarites worshipped fire. And although they know that water quenches fire, they did not forsake their god.
@11
<b>for what does not avail</b> For an idol that does not avail.
@12
<b>O heavens, be astonished</b> Heb. שמו, an expression of astonishment, like השתוממוּ. It is the imperative form, with the same vowel points as (I Sam. 14:9): “If they say thus to us, “Wait (דּמּוּ) .”

<b>become very desolate</b> As though you are becoming desolate because of the Temple that is destined to be destroyed.
@13
<b>two evils</b> Had they exchanged their Deity [lit. their fear] for one His equal, it would be one evil, and now that they have forsaken Me, that I am a spring of living waters, to follow idols, which are like cisterns of stored up water, and they are broken and cracked, and their water is absorbed in their cracks, these are two evils.

@18
<b>what have you to do in the way of Egypt</b> Why do you leave Me and trust in Egypt?

<b>and you said, “I will not transgress.”</b> your words.

@21
<b>I planted you a noble vine stock</b> Heb. שורק is the branches of a good vine, that is to say the children of pious and righteous fathers. Its midrashic interpretation is: I planted you שורק.

<b>your iniquity</b> This is said concerning the iniquity of the ‘Golden Calf,’ which remains in existence forever, as it is stated: “And on the day of My visitation, I will visit upon them their sin” (Exodus 32:34). All visitations that come upon Israel have part of the iniquity of the Golden Calf in them.

<b>See your way in the valley</b> See what you have done opposite Beth-Peor, and until now you adhere to that way like a swift she camel clinging to her ways.
<b>young she-camel</b> Heb. בכרה, a young female camel, that loves to wander. “The young camels (בכרי) of Midian” (Isa. 60:6) is translated “and they are young camels,” as we find in Sanhedrin 52a: There are many old camels laden with the skins of young camels (הוגני).
<b>clinging</b> Adhering to the ways of her youth, an expression similar to: “it would have clung (מסריך סריך)” (Chullin 51a). This may be associated with “a shoe thong (שרוך נעל)” (Gen. 14:23). She binds the ways of her youth in her heart.
@24
<b>A wild donkey</b> (salvatico in O.F.) wild, and some interpret it as poulain in O.F., a foal.
<b>accustomed to the desert</b> Accustomed to be in the deserts, so she loves to wander.
<b>that snuffs up the wind</b> She opens her mouth and snuffs up the wind, and he always returns to his place.
<b>her tendency like the sea creatures, who can hinder her?</b> That trait of the sea creatures that she has, for also the sea creature snuffs up the wind, as it is said: “They snuff up the wind like sea creatures” (infra 14:6). Who can hinder her from that trait? So it is with you who can return you from your evil way?
<b>her tendency like a sea creature</b> Son dagronemant in O.F., dragon nature. Jonathan rendered it in this manner, כערודה. Another explanation: It is an expression of wailing, comp. “moaning and wailing”
<b>all who seek her will not weary</b> For they will weary needlessly, for they will be unable to overtake her. What will her end be? In her month, they will find her. There is one month in the year that she sleeps for the whole month, and then she is captured. You, too, - one month (viz. Ab) was already prepared for you from the days of the spies, when your forefathers established it as a time of vain weeping, therein, you will be captured. (תּאניה ואניה) (Lam. 2:5). Another explanation: (sa contree in French,) her country, comp. Taanath Shiloh (Josh. 16:6).
@25
<b>Withhold your foot from going barefoot</b> This your habit, like the wild donkey that loves to wander. My prophets say to you, “Withhold your foot from idolatry lest you go barefoot into exile and withhold your throat from dying of thirst.”
<b>but you said</b> concerning the words of the prophets.
<b>I despair</b> It is of no concern. I despair of your words. נואש is (nonkalajjr in O.F.) nonchalair in modern French.
@26
<b>when he is found out</b> At the beginning, when he is found to be a thief, and he was presumed to be faithful. In this manner, Jonathan rendered it.
@27
<b>and at the time of their misfortune they say</b> i.e., they say to Me, “Arise and save us.” Jonathan, too, translates in this manner: And at the time that misfortune befalls them, they deny their idols and confess before Me, and say. “Have mercy upon us and save us.”

@31
<b>See the word of the Lord</b> He took out to them the jar of manna. He said to them, “See here how helpful the word of the Lord is.”
<b>was I a desert to Israel</b> Heb. המדבר. This is the interrogative form. Therefore, the ‘mem’ is punctuated ‘weak,’ i.e., without a ‘dagesh’ and the ‘heh’ with a ‘hataph- pattah.’ Did it seem to your forefathers that it was a desert when they traversed it? For I brought down for them this bread, the necessity of each day in its day.
<b>thick darkness</b> מאפליה, an expression of darkness.
<b>Why have My people said, “We have been separated...”?</b> Heb. רדנו, we have been separated from You. Like one who separates (רודֶה) bread from the oven. So is the midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (Bamidbar 2). Menahem, however, explains רדנוּ as an expression of descending (ירידה) and also in other manners (Machbereth Menahem, p. 162).
@33
<b>How you adorn</b> Heb. תיטבי. You adorn yourself to greet your adulterers. Comp. “And she adorned her head” (I Kings 9:30) concerning Jezebel in the section dealing with Jehu.
<b>even to the most evil you accustomed</b> You searched throughout all the evil ways to learn the most corrupt of them all. גם is an expression of ‘even.’
<b>verily</b> Heb. לכן, an expression of a true oath. Verily, to the most evil way of all the ways you accustomed yourself.
<b>you accustomed</b> Heb. למדת, lit. you taught.
@34
<b>you did not find them breaking in</b> You did not find them breaking in when you slew them.
<b>you did not find them</b> So does Scripture say for a feminine second person singular, and there are many such examples in the Book of Ezekiel (16:58), “You bore them (נשאתים).”
<b>but for all these</b> i.e., because they were reproving you for all these things.
@35

<b>In the days of King Josiah</b> when He commanded me to bring back the Ten Tribes, “Have you seen what the backsliding Israel has done? משבה is the same as שובבה, (envejjsede in O.F).
<b>Israel</b> The Ten Tribes.
<b>she goes</b> i.e., when she was still on her land before she was exiled in the days of Hezekiah with Hoshea son of Elah. הלכה means, she would go on every lofty mountain.
<b>and she played the harlot there</b> i.e., she played the harlot by worshipping idols. וַתִּזְנִי is the equivalent of וַתִּזֶן, the ‘yod’ being superfluous.
@7
<b>And I said</b> through My prophets, Amos and Hosea son of Beeri and the other prophets, “You shall return to Me.”
<b>And her treacherous sister Judah saw it</b> i.e., saw all this. The appellation “treacherous” is harsher than “backsliding.” Israel, since they were the first to sin, and they did not see any retribution from which to learn and to repent, are called “backsliding.” Judah, who saw that these went in exile and did not receive correction, are called “treacherous.”
@8
<b>And I saw, because of all that backsliding Israel had committed adultery</b> The signs of the intonation of this verse teach us its explanation. ישראל is punctuated with a ‘zakef-katan,’ separated from שלחתיה, I sent her away. שלחתיה, I sent her away, is punctuated with a ‘zakef-gadol’ by itself. And this is its explanation: I saw; i.e., I contemplated her to exact punishment upon her. And why? Because of all that backsliding Israel had committed adultery. And what was My vengeance? I sent her away from before Me. And treacherous Judah did not fear when she saw the retribution of Samaria, to set her heart to repent.
@9
<b>and she committed adultery with the stones</b> Jonathan paraphrases: And she strayed with the worshippers of stones and wood. And Jonathan renders מִקֹל as an expression of lightness, since her idols were light in her eyes.
@10
<b>And yet for all this</b> that they saw the misfortune of the retribution of their companions.
<b>but falsely</b> Josiah’s generation would show themselves as righteous although they were wicked. They would make forms of pagan deities on the inside of their doors, half on this door and half on this one, and when the destroyers of idols would inspect, the door would be open, and they would not notice it.
@11

@12

<b>for I possessed you</b> and you are called by My name, that I am your Master, and it is not honorable for Me to leave you in the hands of My enemies.
@16

@20
<b>Truly</b> But you did not live up to My expectations [lit., do My thought], but like a woman who betrays her beloved because he cannot provide her sustenance, so did you betray Me, Who provides you with all good. So is the Midrash Aggadah (Tanhuma Mishpatim 17).
@21

@22
<b>Here we are, we have come to You</b> The prophet teaches them to confess and to say as follows, “Here we are, we have come to You... Truly, in vain... But the shameful thing has consumed, etc., Let us lie in our shame.” All this is the language of the prayer that the prophet teaches them to say. We have come אתנו.
@23
<b>Truly, in vain</b> we awaited from the hills and the multitude of mountains where we worshipped idols.

@24

<b>nations will bless themselves with him</b> If you do so, then nations will bless themselves with Israel. Every non-Jew will say to his son, “You shall be like So-and-so the Jew.”
<b>boast</b> Heb. יתהללו, they will recite your praise. Another explanation of is יתהללו: Whoever is able to cleave to Israel will boast about the matter (porvanter in French).
@3
<b>For so said the Lord, etc. Plow for yourself a furrow</b> Learn from the tillers of the soil, who plow it in the summer to kill the roots of the grasses, that it should not grow thorns at the time of sowing in the winter. You, too, improve your deeds before the evil befalls you, so that your prayer should not be rejected when you cry out.
<b>and do not sow upon thorns</b> And let not your cry before Me be from amidst wickedness, but from amidst repentance, that you shall not resemble one sowing without plowing, and that turns into thorns (kardons in O.F., chardons in modern French).
@4
<b>Circumcise yourselves to the Lord</b> Before My anger comes forth like fire. This is like plowing before the sowing.
@5
<b>and say, “Sound a shophar...”</b> Warn the inhabitants of the land that they sound the shophar to flee.
<b>assemble</b> Heb. מלאו. An expression of gathering, and there are many in the Scriptures: (Isaiah 31: 4) “Although a band of (מְלֹא) shepherds gather against him,” Also (infra 12:6) “They called after you a band (מָלֵא).” Also (Job 16:10) “Together they gather (יתמלאוּן) against me.”

<b>will be desolate</b> Heb. תצינה, an expression of desolation.
@8
<b>Because of this</b> What is “this?” “For the fierce anger etc.” Although he spoke above concerning Nebuchadnezzar in regards to the destruction, here he returns to speak of the death of Josiah.
<b>for the fierce anger of the Lord etc.</b> Although Josiah repented wholeheartedly, it is stated concerning him. (II Kings 23:26)... “the Lord did not turn back from his great wrath...because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked Him.”
@9
<b>And it shall be on that day</b> On the day of Josiah they will wonder why so much befell him, for they do not know that his generation did not repent properly. When he came to abolish idolatry, what did the scorners of the generation do? They would engrave an image of a pagan deity on their doors, half of it on this door and half of it on this door. When he would open it, it was not discernible, and when he went away from there, he would close it, and it would join together.
@10
<b>Surely You have misled</b> Heb. השא השאת (fa)tenter in O.F.), tempting, an expression like (Gen. 3: 13) “The serpent misled me (השיאני),” for the false prophets prophesy for them, You will have peace.

Sin is harsh, for it destroys [lit. breaks] before it and after it; before it, since the days of Abraham, as it is stated (Gen. 14:14): “And he pursued until Dan.” As soon as he reached Dan, he grew faint [lit. his strength was weakened], for his children would, in the future, worship idols there, and after it, in the destruction of the Temple, as it is stated: “A voice proclaims from Dan.”

@26
<b>and behold, the fruitful field</b> The land, planted with all good like a forest, has become like a desert. The Midrash Aggadah states: “I saw the mountains”These are the Patriarchs. “And all the hills”These are the Matriarchs. That is to say that their merit was depleted. “There were no people”This refers to Moses, about whom it is said: “humbler than all the people” (Num. 12:3). “And behold the Karmel”This is Elijah.

<b>Be corrected</b> Heb. הוסרי. Accept correction.
<b>lest...be alienated</b> Heb. תקע, lest it be pulled away. יקע is an expression of joining. Comp. “and hang them up (והוקע)” (Num. 25:4), and it is sometimes an expression of detaching. There are many words that are used in such a manner.
@9
<b>thoroughly glean</b> (grappiller in French). After the vineyard has been gathered, and gleanings are left, and the poor come and glean them, so will they spoil and return and spoil.
<b>return your hand</b> You, the enemy, return your hand to spoil a second time, like a vintager who returns his hand for the search, who looks and searches for the gleanings. And so it was when he exiled Jehoiakim and slew him, and crowned Jeconiah, he returned three months later and exiled him. He returned eleven years later and exiled Zedekiah.
<b>the branches</b> Heb. סלסלות (reverchedures in O.F). Comp. (Prov. 4: 8) “Search for it (סלסלה) and it will exalt you.” So did Dunash (Teshuvoth Dunash p. 21) explain it. Menahem (Machbereth p. 126), however, explains it as an expression of a basket (סל) (paniers in O. F. baskets).

<b>Neither are they ashamed</b> They are not ashamed of their evil deeds.
@16
<b>rest</b> Heb. מרגוע.
@17
<b>And I have stationed lookouts over you</b> That is that they station men on the towers at the time of strife. A man looks and sees. If a troop is approaching the city he sounds a shophar and warns the people to arm and to come on the wall. I too appointed prophets who inform you about the impending retribution to alert yourselves and to mend your ways so that you be saved and that is like the shophar sounded by the lookout. Hearken to the sound of this shophar and arm yourselves.
<b>And I have stationed</b> Heb. והקמותי. This means: I have already stationed for them. And so did Jonathan render: ואקימית, and I stationed.
<b>lookouts</b> (Badetes in O.F.).
@18
<b>what is within them</b> i.e., the evil that is in their hands.
@19
<b>the fruit of their thoughts</b> the retribution for their thoughts.
<b>and they rejected My instruction</b> Heb. ותורתי וימאסו בה. This follows the pattern of (Exodus 15:2) “The strength and destruction of God was my salvation (ויהי לי לישועה),” for he should have said: והיה לי לישועה. So too, here it should have said, ותורתי מאסו בה, but it is the style of Scripture to speak in this manner.

@25
<b>there is fear</b> Heb. מגור. Another explanation: An expression of gathering. Comp. (Ezekiel 21: 17) “Gathered (מגורי) to the sword.” And in this manner Jonathan renders it.
@26

<b>a mourning [as] for an only child</b> A mourning for an only son; one who has only one son and he dies.
<b>a bitter lamentation</b> Heb. מספד תמרורים. Since it is the construct state, it is vowelized מספד with a ‘pattah,’ and it is not vowelized מספד with a ‘tzere.’
<b>upon us</b> So to speak, upon Me and upon you.
@27
<b>I have made you the strong one</b> This was said to Jeremiah. I have made you the strong one in their midst, and you shall know and test their way, that he tested them and they will not heed. בחון is an expression of strength. Comp. (Isa. 32:14) “rampart and tower (בחן),” also (ibid. 23:13) “they erected its towers (בחוניו).”
@28
<b>extremely perverse</b> Turning away from the road.
<b>going tale bearing</b> between copper and iron. They introduce hatred between two princes who have the power to provoke one another. That is what I heard. But I say, they are tale bearers, and they are as strong as copper and iron to maintain their falsehood. Jonathan, however, renders this word רכיל as an expression of guile (נוכל). They go with guile as one mixes copper with iron. נוכל is an expression of plot. Comp. (Gen. 37:18) “And they plotted (ויתנכלו) against him to slay him.”
@29
<b>The bellows is heated</b> This is an allegory. When they refine silver, they blow with a bellows, and they always put lead into the crucible, which helps for the refining. But you—I have come to refine you. The bellows is heated and parched because of the fire, and the lead is completely consumed. נחר is an expression related to (Job 42:7) “My wrath has been kindled (חרה)”; (ibid. 30:30) “And my bones are burned (חרה) with heat,” (esrast in O.F.).
<b>in vain</b> In vain does the founder refine, for it is of no avail
<b>and the wicked ones have not been separated</b> from their evil way. That is to say that the prophets toiled to reprove, but it did not avail them.
<b>Separated</b> Heb. נתקו, (furent de... in O.F.). (Another version:) and the wicked ones. This is like רשעים.

(Num. 11:31) “And He caused quails to fly (ויגז)”; also (Job 1:20), “And he shaved (ויגז) his head.” Another explanation is that נזרך means ‘your diadem,’ an expression of greatness, and so did Jonathan render: רברביך your great ones, and so did Menahem classify it (p. 83).
<b>and abandoned</b> Heb. ויטש.
@31
<b>the high places of Topheth</b> That is Molech, which was of copper, and they would heat it up from underneath it with its hands spread out and heated. And they would place the child on his hands, and he would be burnt and moan, and the priests would beat drums so that the father should not hear his son’s voice and take pity. It is called Topheth because of the drum (תּוף), Hinnom because of the child’s moaning (נהמת).
<b>Hinnom</b> Because of the child’s moaning.
<b>which I did not ordain</b> with commandments that they offer up their children as sacrifices, and I did not speak to any of the prophets, and when I did speak to Abraham to slaughter his son, it did not enter My mind that he slaughter, but only to make his righteousness known.

<b>if he repents, will He not return?</b> If they wish to repent of their wickedness, will the Holy One, blessed be He, not return from His decree? Another explanation: If they repent, the repentance will not be permanent, for they will quickly return to their wickedness, and in this manner Jonathan rendered it: If to repent, it is revealed before Me that they will not repent.

<b>There shall be no grapes on the vine</b> Nothing will be left over.
<b>even the leaves will be withered</b> Heb. נבל, an expression of withering (fleirit in French). Comp. (Isa. 34:4) “and as a withered fig (וּכנבלת) from a fig tree.” Also (ibid. 1:30), “like an elm whose leaves are wilting (נבלת).”
<b>for what I gave them they transgressed</b> All this shall befall them because I gave them statutes and they transgressed them.
@14
<b>and there let us sit in silence</b> And let us be silent there. Let us sit there silent and mournful.

@16
<b>From Dan is heard</b> Because they worshipped the calf that was in Dan.
<b>the snorting of their horses</b> The sneezing of his nostrils.
<b>the neighing of their stallions</b> The neighing of joy of his horses, and we find elsewhere that horses are called אבּירים (Jud. 5:22) by reason of the prancings, “the prancings of their mighty ones (אבּיריו),” an expression of (Nahum 3:2) “a prancing horse.” And Jonathan renders: from the sound of the steps of their mighty ones.
@17
<b>serpents, adders</b> After seventy years, the snake becomes a צפע, which shuts its ear so that it will not hear the voice of the charmer who charms him, as it is stated (Psalms 58:5), “Like a deaf asp that shuts up its ear.” That is the meaning of “that cannot be charmed.”
@18
<b>Were I to suppress my grief</b> Heb. מבליגיתי, my suppression, and it is a noun, (mes estenimenc in O.F.). That is to say, if I said, I will suppress and keep in my grief.

<b>the health of</b> lit. the cure of, (emplatre in O.F.), plaster, dressing.

@1
<b>a company of traitors</b> Companies of traitors.
@2
<b>They have directed</b> Lit. trodden. This expression is appropriate for the preparation of the bow to shoot an arrow, and a bow (קשת) is (arbalete in French), and they tread it with their feet. Therefore, he calls it treading, and the prophet compared their tongue to a treacherous bow, for they directed their tongue like a treacherous bow.
<b>from evil to evil</b> From sin to sin.
@3
<b>forges plans</b> He lays traps.
@4
<b>they commit iniquity [until] they are weary</b> They wearied themselves and toiled to pervert their way. העוה is like (Exod. 8:11) “and making heavy (והכבּד) his heart,” to commit iniquity.

<b>Their tongue is a deadly arrow</b> Heb. שחוט, drawn. Comp. (I Kings 10:16) “malleable gold” (שחוט). Also, (Hos. 5:2) “And the extent of their turning away (ושחטה),” (tirer in French), pulling. Another explanation is that it is actually an expression of slaughter (tranchant in French, cutting). In this manner Menahem classified it (Machbereth Menahem p. 172), and in this manner Jonathan rendered it: כּגיר די מחרף, like a sharpened arrow.
<b>but in his heart</b> lit. in his midst. Jonathan renders: in his innards.
@9
<b>for the mountains</b> i.e., for the destruction of the mountains.
<b>for the dwellings of the wilderness</b> The dwelling of the shepherds in the wilderness. נאות is an expression of a dwelling. Comp. (Psalms 83: 13) “the dwellings (נאות) of God,” also (ibid. 93:5) “to Your house, the dwelling (נאוה) of sanctity.”
<b>they are withered</b> Heb. נצתו. An expression of aridness. Comp. (v. 11) “withered (נצתה) .”
<b>have fled and are gone</b> i.e., they are destined to go. For fifty-two years no one passed through Judah; from the exile of Zedekiah until the order of Cyrus, king of Persia, were fifty-two years. An allusion to the matter [is that the numerical value for] “and the beast” (בּהמה) amounts to fifty-two, and the computation is exact, in Tractate Megillah [should read: Yoma 54a].

@11

<b>Gather in from the land your merchandise</b> Heb. כנעתך. Hide, gather in from the land your merchandise. Comp. (Hos. 12:8) “The trafficker (כּנען) in his hand are deceitful scales.” Menahem explains כנעתך as an expression of humility (הכנעה) and lowliness. And אספי is an expression of bending down. Bend down and humble yourself more than the lowliness of the earth, you Jerusalem, that dwells now in a fortified city (Machbereth p. 107).

<b>their flocks</b> Heb. מרעיתם, lit. their pasture, the flocks of their pasture.
@23

<b>like a lamb [and] a bull</b> Heb. ככבש אלוף. Dunash and Judah son of Kudish (Karish) interpreted it as a lamb and a bull, brought to the slaughter. And אלוף is like (Deut. 28:4) “the offspring of your cattle (אלפיך).” Although it was not stated ואלוף, we find similar cases, e.g., (Habukkuk 3:11) “The sun [and] the moon (ירח) stood on high”; (Isaiah 38:14) “Like a crane [and] a swallow (עגור) so I chirp.” And Menahem interpreted ככבש אלוף, a large lamb (see Psalms 58:9, Rashi ad loc.), and Jonathan supports him, since he renders like a choice lamb.

<b>with footmen</b> Heb. רגלים (pieton in O.F), pedestrian.
<b>how will you compete with horses</b> To run with the horses. That is to say, If even your brethren the priests come to kill you, surely the princes of Judah will rise up against you to kill you. This is the reason for My anger against them, and this is the reason for the success of the enemy. And so did Jonathan render: This is the reply, etc. And, according to the Midrash of our Rabbis (Sanhedrin 96a): If you are amazed about the reward for the three steps that Nebuchadnezzar ran in My honor in the days of Merodach-baladan, why I gave him so much greatness, how much more will you be amazed when you see the payment of reward that I will pay the righteous who ran before Me like horses!
<b>will you compete</b> (aastir in O.F.).
<b>and in the peaceful land that you trust</b> there they wearied you.
<b>how will you do in the heights</b> The princes of Judah. The pride of the Jordan is symbolic since it is a place of lions and tigers, and Jonathan taught us this in many places. And here he paraphrased. And how do you expect to do against the wild beasts that are on the height of the Jordan? “And behold, as a lion ascends from the height of the Jordan,” Jonathan renders in two places (infra 49:19, 50:44): like a lion that ascends from the height of the Jordan.

<b>Moses and Samuel</b> Both were needed to beg mercy for Israel, but first they induced them to repent, and afterwards they prayed on their behalf, but they had no idea of turning away My wrath until they had induced them to repent. Moses said (Exodus 32:27), “Let each man put his sword...” (v. 20) “and he scattered it on the surface of the water, etc.” And afterwards (v. 30), “I will ascend to the Lord, perhaps I will atone.” Samuel in Mizpah (I Samuel 7:4,5) “And the children of Israel removed the Baalim,” and afterwards, “‘Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I shall pray to the Lord on your behalf (sic).’” But you cannot bring them back to Me, therefore do not pray for them.

@2
<b>Such as are for death, to death</b> Each calamity mentioned later in this verse is harsher than the one preceding it. The sword is harsher than death. Death by the sword is defacing, whereas death in bed is not defacing. And so he says (Psalms 116:15): “Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His Saints.” Famine is harsher than the sword, for this one is agonizing whereas the other is not agonizing. And so Scripture states (Lam. 4:9): “Better are those who die from the sword than those who die from famine.” Captivity - all sorts of death are in it.

<b>1 leave you over</b> I leave you over, an expression of a remnant. In this manner, Menahem (Machbereth p. 181) interpreted it, but Dunash (Teshuvoth Dunash p. 36) interpreted it as an expression of release. And שֵרִיתִיךָ is like (Dan. 5:12) “And untying (וּמְֹשָרֵא) knots,” and the interpretation of שֵרִיתִיךָ is so, as it is stated (below 40:4): “Behold I have released you from the chains that are on your hand.” That is to say, on that day that the Lord fulfilled His word, it was said to him, “And now, behold I have released you today from the chains that are on your hand, if it pleases you to come with me to Babylon.” And also, Israel begged him to pray for them, as it was said to him (below 42:4): “Pray on our behalf to the Lord our Cod, for we remain few from many.”
<b>Verily I will</b> lit., if not, an expression of an oath.
<b>I will cause [them] to beg you in time of evil</b> with the enemy. When evil befalls them, they will beg you to supplicate God for mercy upon them, for example, Zedekiah said to him, (below 21:2) “Beseech God now on our behalf, etc.” Another explanation. Nebuzaradan will beg you (below 40:4), “If it pleases you to come with me to Babylon.”
@12
<b>Will iron break iron from the north</b> I say that iron that comes from the north is harder than other iron, and this is its interpretation: They were compared to iron (above 6:28), “Going tale bearing like copper and iron.” And concerning Jeremiah it is stated (above 1:18): “I have made you... into an iron pillar and into copper walls,” and his is stronger than theirs, for Nebuchadnezzar will come upon them according to his words.
<b>Will…break</b> Will their iron break yours? Another explanation: Will Pharaoh who comes in your aid, who is as hard as iron, break Nebuchadnezzar, who is iron that comes from the north and copper? Targum Jonathan is inclined toward this direction.

<b>Not Passhur did the Lord call your name, etc.</b> Your name was not called Pashhur except for this matter, that is to say: פָֹשַח ֹשָחוֹר, cut off and black like “a tree that was cut off (נִפְֹשַח)” (Shevi’ith 4:6, Orlah 1:5). Also (Lam. 3:11), “And He cut me off (וַיִפַֹשְחֵנִי).” And so he said to him, Not Pashhur did He call your name, for the expression of Pashhur means a great man and the son of nobles, Pashhur. ‘Pash’ denotes expansion and ‘hur’ nobility. But for this reason your name was called Pashhur, Pashah shahor. ‘Pashah’ means ‘cut off,’ and ‘shahor’ means ‘black.’ Another explanation. ‘Pashah sehor.’ Many will be around you to slay you.

Comp. (Dan. 4:11) “Cut down (גֹדוּ) the trees.” But Dunash (Teshuvoth p. 54) interpreted it as an actual expression of telling, and this is its interpretation: “Tell false things about him and we will tell about him to the king.” And we have like נַגִידֶנוּ, we will tell about him, many words in the Scriptures that cannot be interpreted unless they are divided into two words or three. Comp. (Gen. 37: 4) “And they could not speak with him (דַבְּרוֹ) peacefully.” Also (supra 10:20), “My children have left me (יצאני).”

<b>Weep not for the dead</b> Namely, for Jehoiakim, who will die before the gate, when they drag him into exile.

Deduce from here that Jehoiakim’s death, concerning which it is stated (infra 36:30): “And his carcass shall be cast to the heat by day and to the cold at night,” is preferable to the life of Jehoiachin, about whom it is stated (52:34): “And his meals, regular meals, etc.”
@11
<b>concerning Shallum</b> That is Zedekiah, and that is what he was called in I Chron.

<b>and ceiled with cedar</b> He covers the roof with cedars.
<b>and painted with vermilion</b> painted with dyes, so does Jonathan render. בּשָּׁשַּׁר is a color of a type used for painting. Another explanation: וּמָשּׁוֹחַ בִּשָּׁשַּׁר is like a cord used for measuring (חוּט הַמִּשְּׁחָה) ([a] lignant en sinople in O.F.), drawing green lines, delineate with a green color.

And I do not know how to explain how the expression ‘Bashan’ fits to the gates of the Temple Mount, unless it is because of the doors which they make from the terebinths of Bashan, and that is the name of a place, or the expression, ‘Bashan’ denotes a place of a wide valley. So is the area of the Temple Mount an open area around the Temple.

And, according to the Midrash Aggadah (Pesikta d’Rav Kahana, p. 163a): In the place to which he was removed (נִתַּק), there he was rectified (נִתְקַן), for he repented in Babylon, and the Holy One, blessed be He, applied for absolution of the oath He had sworn, “Inscribe this man childless.” and Zerubbabel was born to him in Babylon, and it was said to him through the prophet (Haggai 2:23), “On that day...I will take you, Zerubbabel, and I will make you as a signet,” directed toward what He said to his father, “Though...be a signet on My right arm,...I will remove him (sic).”

That is to say, “Are you despised and broken in your eyes like a small infant who is being swathed (emmailloter in French)? This one is not worthy.”

<b>“What is the burden of the Lord?”</b> This is an expression of derision, for his prophecy is a burden to them.
<b>you shall say to them, “What burden? And I will forsake you, etc.”</b> They say to you (sic), “What is the burden?” You are the burden of the Holy One, blessed be He, and He says that He will forsake you and cast you off His arms from heaven to earth. So I heard.
<b>and I will forsake</b> Heb. וְעָזַבְתִּי.
@36
<b>For the burden shall be to the man of His word</b> Although you pervert the massa into a pejorative, the prophecy (משא) of the word of the Lord shall be to the man of His word, and to the man of His counsel He reveals it, but you pervert it to an expression of a burden. This interpretation I did not hear, but it is the main interpretation. But this is how I heard it, namely that the burden shall be a burden of retribution for the one who says it, who asks, “What is the burden?” Another interpretation: משא is an expression of prophecy, and the false prophet would ask the true prophet to tell him the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, in the language in which the expression came to him, and the expression did not explain the speech adequately. Therefore, the false prophet would pervert it to another meaning and would speak after the fashion of the true prophet in order that they should believe him. And so did Hananiah son of Azzur do. Therefore, he says, “Do not ask the prophecy of the Lord,” the language of the expression, but “What did He speak?” or “What did He reply?” The explanation of the words you shall ask the true prophet to tell you what the Holy One, blessed be He, says, and to what His words are inclined.
<b>for the prophecy shall be for the man of His word</b> The unexplained expression the Holy One, blessed be He, said unexplained to the man of His counsel, who is not suspected of perverting it, but you ask it in order to pervert it, and you pervert the words of the Holy One, blessed be He, and that is what is stated above (v. 30): “those who steal My words from one another.” This too is a correct explanation.
@37
<b>So shall you say to the prophet</b> when you come to ask My words of the prophet.
@39
<b>and I will exile</b> an expression of “the sinew that was dislocated (גִיד הַנָֹּשֶה)” (Gen. 32:33), and an expression of “their might has failed (נָֹשְתָה),” it jumps and moves from place to place.

Another explanation: הֶחָרָש וְהַמַּסְגֵּר: הֶחָרָש is an expression of silence, וְהַמַּסְגֵּר is an expression of closing. That is to say, great sages in Torah, to the extent that when one of them would speak, everyone would remain silent. מַסְגֵּר means that when they would close the discussion, no one would reopen it.

Fifteen years they (the bars and thongs) were on his neck, from the first year of Jehoiakim until the fourth year of Zedekiah, when Hananiah son of Azzur broke them off him.

<b>And it came to pass in that year</b> When that time arrived that Nebuchadnezzar gave Zedekiah dominion over the five kings to whom Jeremiah stated his message and sent the thongs and the bars to the kings by the hand of their ambassadors.
<b>in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah</b> In the beginning of his dominion over the five kings. But it is impossible to say that it means at the beginning of his reign, since it says, “in the fourth year.” In that year, he went down to greet Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon, and Seraiah the receptionist was with him, as is stated at the end of the Book (51:59), and he gave him dominion over the kings.
<b>said to me</b> Our Sages state: Who misled Hananiah? He heard Jeremiah prophesying in the upper street, “Behold I am breaking the bow of Elam” (49:35). And this prophecy was said in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, as is explained there, and since Elam is adjacent to Babylon, he stood in the lower street, and expounded. And he derived a major case from a minor one. If Elam, who came only to aid the Chaldeans, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Behold I am breaking the bow of Elam,” how much more is this so with the Chaldeans themselves? He came into the lower street and said: So said the Lord: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon, as it is in Sanhedrin (89a).

I am a priest, and I eat the food hallowed in the name of Heaven if the Temple remains standing. But you are a Gibeonite, as it is written [here], “who was from Gibeon.” And you will be a slave to me, chopping wood and drawing water (Pesikta Rabbathi 27:4, Yalkut Shimoni ad loc.). But Moreh Zedek who did not explain, adopted the reason of our Sages (Sotah 41b) who learned from here that whoever flatters a wicked man will ultimately fall into his hands or into the hands of his son or into the hands of his son’s son, for Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah seized him and brought him to prison.

Some are inclined to say that Hanamel was both Jeremiah’s uncle and his uncle’s son; e.g. Reuben married the daughter of his brother Simon, and she bore him Jemuel, and Simon had already begotten Jamin. Hence, Jamin is Jemuel’s uncle, since he is his mother’s brother, and also his uncle’s son, since he is the son of Simon, Jemuel’s father’s brother. This is, however, not the method of expression, for we do not find anywhere in the Bible, that the mother’s brother is called an uncle.

@1
<b>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year</b> The prophet presented his words obscurely and did not tell his name, who he was; nor did he explain from what date he was counting. Therefore, the holy spirit interrupted his words in the following two verses to teach [us] who the prophet was and to teach [us] from what date he was counting. As it is said: “On the fifth day of the month that is the fifth year, etc.” These are not the words of the prophet, for he already stated that he was standing on the fifth of the month, and furthermore, from the beginning he had stated his prophecy in the first person: “and I was in the midst of the exile”; “and I saw visions of God.” And so at the end: “And I saw, and behold, a storm wind, etc.” Now these [next] two verses interrupted his words, as though someone else was speaking about him: “The word of the Lord was [revealed] to Ezekiel...and the hand of the Lord came upon him there.”
<b>as I was in the midst of the exile</b> i.e., outside the land of Israel.
<b>by the river Chebar</b> The name of the river.
<b>visions of God</b> Heb. מַרְאוֹת. Because he did not see with a “lucid speculum,” he calls it “visions of God,” a sort of dream, insubstantial. All the prophets also saw through a “dim speculum,” except for our teacher Moses. That is what is said (Hos. 12:11): “and to the prophets, I assumed likenesses.”
@2
<b>that is the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile</b> Thus, we may deduce that the thirty years he counted, he counted from the beginning of the jubilee [cycle]: the last jubilee commenced at the beginning of the eighteenth year of Josiah[‘s reign]; that is, the year that Hilkiah found the scroll (II Kings 22). So we learn in Seder Olam (ch. 26), that the beginning of the jubilee was that [year]. Josiah reigned thirty one years. Subtracting from them the seventeen years that had already passed leaves fourteen years. Jehoiakim reigned eleven years; [together, that] totals twenty-five years. Jeconiah [Jehoiachin] his son, had reigned only three months when he was exiled, and the year that Ezekiel prophesied was the fifth [year] of his exile, hence the thirtieth year of the jubilee. And so we find that at the end of his prophecy, he gives a sign using the count of the jubilee [as a reference], for it says (40:1): “In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month.” Our Rabbis said (Arachin 12a): What “year” is it that begins on the tenth of the month? You must say that this is the jubilee year [See Leviticus 25:9f.].
@3
<b>The word of the Lord was [revealed]</b> Heb. הָיֹה הָיָה [lit. being was.] Our Sages said (Mechilta to Exod. 12:1): “[It] had already come,” because the Shechinah does not rest upon a prophet outside the [Holy] Land, except by having first rested upon him in the Land. We learned in a Baraitha of the Mechilta (Exod. 15:9): [The verse 2:1,] “Son of man, stand on your feet,” was the [actual] beginning of the Book, only there is no chronological order [in Scripture]. Others say that (12:1f.) “Son of man, compose a riddle,” is the [true] beginning of the Book. [Mechilta ends here.] I say that this prophecy was told to him before they were exiled, because it is appropriate to be said to him in the Land, for the community of the exile is not mentioned explicitly in it. It can be recognized as the beginning of his mission to them. Jonathan, too, paraphrased in that manner: The prophetic word from before the Lord was revealed to Ezekiel the son of Buzi the priest in the land of Israel; it returned a second time and spoke with him in the state of the land of the Chaldeans. Now Ezekiel was exiled with the “craftsmen and the sentries of the gates,” who were exiled with Jehoiachin.
<b>the hand of the Lord</b> Every expression of יַד mentioned in this Book or in any expression of prophecy is invariably an expression of compulsion, [implying] that the prophecy seizes him against his will, like a person going mad, destreze in Old French, compulsion.
@4
<b>and behold, a tempest was coming from the north</b> That is the Chariot of the throne of the glory of the Shechinah, as it is described in this chapter (verse 28). Since it came with fury to destroy Israel, it is therefore likened to a tempest and a [storm] cloud.
<b>coming from the north</b> It was returning from the land of the Chaldeans, which is in the north. As it is said (Jer. 1:14): “From the north the misfortune will break forth.” And why did it go there [first]? In order to subjugate the whole world to Nebuchadnezzar, to prevent the nations from saying that He delivered His children into the hands of a lowly nation, for the Chaldeans were [considered] a lowly nation. As it is said (Isa. 23:13): “this people has never been.” So did our Sages expound on this verse in tractate Chagigah (13b).
<b>with a brightness around it</b> Surrounding the cloud on the outside, implying that Israel was destined to be redeemed from there [Babylonia].
<b>it was like the color of the chashmal</b> “Chashmal” is an angel bearing that name, and he [Ezekiel] saw [something] like the appearance of its color in the midst of the fire. And so did our Sages say: There was an incident involving a child who was expounding on the account of the Chariot. He perceived the meaning of “chashmal,” [whereupon] fire emanated from the chashmal and consumed him. They said further that the word itself is a combination: When they asked, “What is chashmal?” replied Rav Judah, “Living beings (חֶיוֹת) of fire (אֵש) that speak (מִמַלְלוֹת) .” In a Baraitha we learned: Sometimes silent (חָשּׁוֹת), sometimes speaking (מִמַלְלוֹת) when the speech emanates from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, they remain silent. When the speech does not emanate from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, they speak; that is, they laud and praise the Lord (Chag. 13). [Possibly, “chashmal” is the name of the color resembling the color of fire, for he said, “Chashmal from the midst of the fire,” and he said (verse 27): “the color of chashmal, the appearance of fire within it found about, from the appearance of his loins and above.” And, he says in the second vision (8:2): “and from his loins and above was like the appearance of a splendor, like the color of chashmal.” An addendum that I heard.] And from the midst of it, [i.e.,] that fire, I saw something like the color of chashmal that appeared from the midst of the fire. But we do not know what it is, and the midrash that our Sages expounded on it, [defining “chashmal” as] living beings of fire that speak, does not seem to me to the context.
@5
<b>they had the likeness of a man</b> This is surprising, because they had also the likeness of an ox, a lion, and an eagle! Apparently, since this [being] is the patron of them all [all the living beings], the prophet praises the Chariot with it. [Their human face] had the countenance of our father Jacob.
@6
<b>and each one had four faces</b> “Each one” means that the human countenance had four faces, as did that of the lion, the eagle, and the ox, totaling sixteen [faces] to one living being. It was thus for each living being, and four wings for each of the faces, totaling sixty-four wings for each living being. This is [why] Jonathan paraphrased: two hundred fifty-six wings.
@7
<b>were straight legs</b> [Jonathan renders]: רִגְלִין כֵּיוָנָן parallel legs, this one opposite this one. Another explanation: “straight,” meaning they had no knee joints by which to bend their legs because they do no sitting or lying. Therefore they do not require joints like those of animalsthe upper joint and the lower joint by which it bends its legs to lie down.
<b>a round foot</b> Heb. עֵגֶל, a round foot, and so did Jonathan render it: round feet.
<b>and they sparkled</b> Because of their brilliance, sparks seemed to emanate from them, as we say in tractate Yoma (37b): She too [Queen Helene] made a golden candelabrum, etc. When the sun shone, sparks would [seemingly] emanate from it, etc. וְנוֹצְצִים is etincelants in French, gleaming.
<b>like the color</b> Heb. כְּעֵין, like מַרְאֶה, the appearance.
<b>burnished copper</b> Heb. קָלָל, clarified and gleaming. Menachem (Machbereth p. 155) associated it with (Lev. 2: 14): “roasted (קָלוּי) in fire.”
@8
<b>And human hands were beneath their wings</b> As the Targum paraphrases: to pick up coals of fire with them, etc. Likewise, we find in this Book (10:7): “And the cherub stretched forth his hand, etc. to the fire that was between the cherubim, and he picked it up and gave it to the hands of the one dressed in linen.” And so, [in the verse] after it, “And there appeared to the cherubim the form of a human hand, etc.” The human hands pick up the fire and give it to the cherub, and the cherub [gives it] to the messenger, in order [to allow] the coals to cool off [as they pass] from hand to hand, to mitigate Israel’s punishment.
<b>on their four sides</b> To the four directions of the world, for they have faces and wings in every direction.
<b>and their faces and their wings were the same to all four of them</b> As the Targum renders: were the same to all four of them.
@9
<b>Their wings joined one to the other</b> Each one’s wing was spread out to the side of the other one’s wing this way [lit. to here] and that way [lit. to here] until they join and touch each other, thereby covering their faces, for the wings are spread out over the face.
<b>they did not turn when they walked</b> If they wished to walk in any desired direction, they did not need to turn their faces because they have faces on every side; therefore each one went in the direction of his facein the direction of the face on that side where they desired to go, they would go.
@11
<b>And so were their faces, and their wings were extended upward</b> Had I not seen the cantillation sign of a “zakef gadol” [indicating a pause] punctuating “And so were their faces,” I would not know how to explain it, but the punctuation taught me to separate them [the words of the verse] one from the other and to place the word וּפְנֵיהֶם by itself. And so, [this] is its explanation: And they had faces and their wings were extended above their faces and covered them. How so? “Each had two wings joined to each other”to each face, their two wings were joined. On each one, the wing of this living being was stretched out towards the side of that living being, and this one’s towards the side of this one, and the face that was in between was covered by them. [A verse whose wording] is similar to the language of this verse appears again in this chapter (verse 18): “And they had backs, and they were very high and they were dreadful.” The word וְגֲבֵּיהֶן, “and they had backs,” stands by itself.

So, when they would thrust their heads out from under the expanse that was extended above themas is delineated in the chapterthey would recoil because of the Shechinah, which is above the expanse, and they hasten to pull their heads [down].
<b>like the appearance of the sparks</b> Heb. הֲבָּזָק, de l’etincelle in French, and the color of their fire is like the color of the fire that emanates from between the shards within which gold is refined in a furnace. The fire that emanates from there is colored with these colors (ibid.). [Addendum—Others explain הַבָּזָק as an expression of scattering, as our Sages explained it (Gen. Rabbah 50:1): “like the appearance of the bazak” R. Judah in the name of R. Simon in the name of R. Levi the son of Perata: Like one who scatters (הַבּוֹזֵק) ‘gefeth’ in a stove, i.e., he scatters ‘gefeth’ the residue of olives in a stove: it ignites quickly and raises a flame, and the flame ascends and descends, and this is the meaning of “would run and return.” Furthermore we find in their words (Sanh. 108b, according to Aruch) בזק used as an expression of scattering: “He scattered (בָּזַק) dust on them and it turned into swords,” meaning he scattered, and so in the Mishnah (Eruvin 10:14): “We may scatter (בּוֹזְקִין) salt on the ramp so that they should not slip.” בזק may also be defined as ברק (lightning), which is an expression of searching.

<b>the sound of stirring, like the sound of a camp</b> Like the sound of their speech when they thank and bless their Master; it was like the sound of the camp of the angels on high.
<b>when they would stand, they would let down their wings</b> [and cease] from making a sound be heard, and Jonathan rendered: when they would stand, they would silence their wings because of the speech, [i.e., because of] the speech of the Omnipresent emanating from above their heads, to let the prophets hear His mission, as he [Ezekiel] concludes (verse 25): “And there was a voice, etc.” The Midrash Aggadah (Gen. Rabbah 65:11) states: “When they would stop praising [God] so that Israel would praise first.”

<b>And He said to me: “Son of man, etc.”</b> He calls Ezekiel “son of man” because he saw the Celestial Chariot while walking among [the denizens of—Malbim ed.] the heavenly heights and involving himself with it like the angels, as if to say “There is no one here of woman born but this one.” (So did a man explain this to my rabbi, and he [thus] pleased him. I hold, however, that He called him “son of man” only so that he should not become haughty from having become familiar with the Celestial Chariot and with workings of the heavenly beings.This [latter remark] does not appear in other editions.
@2
<b>what was being spoken to me</b> Heb. מִדַבֵּר. What was being spoken with me. And it is respectful to write מִדַבֵּר when referring to [the One in] Heaven, for if one says מְדַבֵּר, the implication is [that He speaks] like a man who speaks to his fellow, turning to him face to face; but if one says מִדַבֵּר, it means that the Shechinah, in His eminence, is soliloquizing, and His messengers will overhear; porpariliz in Old French, intimate words.

<b>obstinate</b> Heb. סָרָבִים, a term for disobedience, like סָרְבָנִים (Menachem p.129), but Dunash (p. 77) interpreted it as a word for thorns [like the next word, סלונים. Consequently] there are two words [for thorns].

<b>and you sit on eglantines</b> Heb. עַקְרַבִּים. The people whom you reprove will weary you and provoke you [making you feel] as if you were sitting on eglantines, which prick you on all sides. עַקְרַבִּים are eglantiers in French, eglantines. Another interpretation: literally scorpions [the usual meaning of עַקְרַבִּים] and so did Jonathan render: “and among people whose deeds are like scorpions, you dwell.”

[Gloss: Another explanation: Shumir is a term for a strong rock, and in Targum Yerushalmi it is used as the translation of צוּר, rock, and so too is the Targum of מִצוּר הָחֲלָמִישּׂ as מִשְּׂמִיר טִנָרָא “out of the flinty rock” (Deut. 8:15).

Jonathan rendered: אֶפְרוֹרְוָן, which are villages that his armies make, and [the armies] dwell in tents on [all] sides of the city, so that no man could come or go. Another explanation is that כָּרִים are officers appointed over the army; this one guards on this side, and that one on that side.

@5
<b>I have given you the years of their iniquity, etc.</b> I have made it easier for you to tolerate the pain that I Myself suffered for the number of the years that they sinned before Me: for you I converted it to that number in days. [Another explanation: שְּׁנֵי is like שְׁנַיִם, two, and so did Jonathan render: Now I have given you twice as much as their iniquity. This does not appear in other editions].
<b>three hundred and ninety days</b> We learned in Seder Olam (ch. 26): This teaches us that Israel sinned for three hundred and ninety years from the time they entered the Land until the ten tribes were exiled therefrom. You find [the events of] two hundred and forty-three of them delineated: From the time Jeroboam assumed the throne until Hoshea son of Elah was exiled and in “the days that the judges judged” are one hundred and eleven years. The rest, however, are not delineated. (These are [the calculations of] the three hundred and ninety years—that I found in a responsum from Rabbi Joseph, the head of the yeshivah—that the ten tribes sinned from the days of Joshua until Sannecherib exiled them from Samaria. Calculate: in the days of the Judges there were 8 years under the rule of Cushan, 18 under the rule of Eglon, 20 under the rule of Sisera, 7 under the rule of Midian, 18 under the rule of the children of Ammon, and 40 under the rule of the Philistines. This totals 111. From Micah until the Ark was captured were 40 years, totaling 151. Calculate for Jeroboam son of Nebat 22, Nadab his son 2, Baasa 24, Elah his son 2, Omri 12, Ahab 22, Ahaziah his son 2, Jehoram his brother 12, Jehu 28, Jehoahaz 17, Jehoash his son 16, Jeroboam his son 41the total is 350 (sic.). And [with] Menachem son of Gadi 10, Pekahiah his son 2, Pekah son of Remaliah 20, and Hoshea son of Elah 9 years, the total is 391, but Hoshea’s last year is not counted because in Hoshea’s ninth year, Samaria was captured and Hoshea was counted as having reigned 8 years, leaving a total of 390. The forty years that the kings of Judah sinned after the exile of Sannecherib until [the prophecy of] this chapter was said to Ezekiel are delineated below, and I did not find it necessary to explain them. This is not found in other editions.)
@6
<b>the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days</b> This teaches us that the house of Judah sinned, from the time that the ten tribes were exiled until Jerusalem was destroyed, forty years: 22 of Manasseh, about whom it is written (II Kings 21:3): “as Ahab...had made,” and Ahab had reigned 22 years; two of Ammon and 11 of Jehoiakim, and this prophecy was transmitted to Ezekiel in the fifth year of Zedekiah. This totals 40 years. The grand total is four hundred and thirty [years]. After this prophecy, they remained yet six years, equaling 8 jubilees and 36 years. In 8 jubilees [there] are 8 cycles of Sabbatical years, equaling 56 Sabbatical years, totaling 64 [hallowed years]. In 36 years, there are 5 Sabbatical years, totaling 69 land-release years, and the final jubilee year is accounted to them as an iniquity because they were exiled from it [the land] because of their iniquity, totaling 70 hallowed years of land release, which Israel did not observe. Therefore, they were exiled 70 years to fulfill (Lev. 26:34): “Then the land will appease its Sabbaths.” That is what is written at the end of Chronicles (II 36:21): “To fulfill the word of the Lord [that was] in the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land has appeased its Sabbaths, for as long as it lay desolate, it rested, to complete seventy years.” “Your left side” symbolizes Samaria; “your right side” symbolizes Judah, because Judah is in the south of the land of Israel, as it is said (16:46): “And your big sister Samaria...who lives at your left.” Also in the Book of Joshua (15:1), he describes the border of the tribe of Judah as occupying the entire southern border.

This is a sign that a third of them will perish in the heat of hunger in its midst, which is like fire, in the same way that it says (Lam. 5:10): “Our skin is parched as by a furnace because of the heat of hunger.”

@4
<b>And you shall take more of them</b> From those few people.

@7

[The word] הֲמָנְכֶם is an expression of (Dan 1:5): “And the king allotted (וַיְמַן) [food] for them.” Menachem, though, interpreted it as an expression of stirring, like (Ps. 46: 7): “Nations have stirred (הָמוּ).”
<b>and like the customs of the nations that were around you, you did not do</b> For they did not exchange their gods, although they are not gods, but you exchanged My glory for something that avails not.

Menachem associated it with (Ps. 119:158): “I saw traitors, and I quarreled (וָאֶתְקוֹטָטָה).” They will quarrel with themselves for not listening to Me. Jonathan renders: וְידַנְקוּן and they will see, and so does he translate (below 9:4): “those who groan (הַנֶאֶנָקִים),” דְּמִדַנְקִין, and (Mal. 2:13): “weeping...and groaning (וַאֲנָקָה),” דְּמִדַנְקָן, demonir in Old French, to groan.

<b>and a thick cloud of incense</b> Heb. עֲתַר, thick. The ascent of the smoke of the cloud of the incense [was thick]. The word עַתַר denotes immensity, and so (35:13): “and have magnified (הַעְתַּרְתֶּם) your words against Me,” and so (Prov. 27:6): “whereas kisses of an enemy are burdensome (נַעְתָּרוֹת).” Menachem (p. 140) grouped all three under one heading and they all denote an idea of thickness, but each one is an independent expression.

@14
<b>to the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord</b> Within the inner space of the courtyard [that led] to the entrance of the heichal that is in the north, for the master [R. Jose the son] taught: Two wickets were in the Temple chamber for the knives, one in the north and one in the south (see Zev. 55b, 56a).
<b>making the Tammuz weep</b> There was an image that they would heat up from the inside, and its eyes, which were of lead, would melt from the heat of the fire, and it would appear as though it was weeping, and they would say, “It is asking for an offering.” “Tammuz” is an expression of heating, like (Dan. 3:19): “more than it was wont to be heated (לְמֵזְיֵהּ)”; (ibid. 22), “and the furnace exceedingly hot (אֵזֵהּ).” Making the Tammuz cry is fesant plorer la chalfez in Old French; making the heated [god] weep.
@16
<b>And He brought me to the inner court of the house of the Lord</b> This is the Temple court, for the Temple Mount is called the outer court, and until now that is where he [already] had been standing, except that he had entered the northern gate when He showed him the image of the Tammuz in the chamber of the knives. Then He brought him to the east, [to stand] before the Temple and the altar.
<b>and their faces toward the east</b> From the implication of the statement, “and their faces toward the east,” I [already] know that “their backs were toward the Temple,” but [Scripture] tells us that their posteriors were exposed, for they would uncover themselves and excrete downward.
<b>and they were prostrating themselves</b> Heb. מִשְּׁתַּחֲוִיתֶם. This serves as two words, an expression of destruction (הַשְּׁחָתָה) and an expression of prostrating oneself (הִשְּׁתַּחֲוָיָה). So it is in Yerushalmi (Suc. 5:5, see Korban Ha’edah): “They were destroying the Temple and bowing to the sun.” Jonathan, too, rendered in that manner: and they were destroying and bowing.” Menachem (p. 171) classified it as an expression of bending down, like (Isa. 51:23): “Bend down (שְּׁחִי) and let us cross.”

<b>Was it [too] trivial to the house of Judah</b> Is it trivial and light in their eyes, the other sins that they have committed?

<b>for they have [already] filled the land with violence</b> and that that iniquity is trivial in their eyes, and they repeatedly provoke Me within My house with these abominations.
<b>and behold they send disgrace into their nose</b> Behold they send to their nose the foul odor of this “song,” which they “sing” with the wind emerging from their anus; i.e., this disgrace of theirs will come back to their faces. Menachem (p. 79) explained: “and behold they send the disgrace into their nose” is a matter of disgrace and shame; and according to his explanation, He compares the aroma of their censers and (Ezek. 20:28) “the anger of their sacrifices” and (ibid.) “their pleasant aroma” to the work of the disgrace of the orifices. “Their backs to the Temple of the Lord” implies this idea.

Our Rabbis said (Chag. 13b): Ezekiel begged for mercy and transformed it to a cherub. He said before Him, “Master of the world, an accuser cannot become a defender.”

<b>between the wheels</b> Heb. (בֵּינוֹתלַגַלְגַל) [lit. between the wheel.] Wherever it says, “And he said...and he said,” it is meant only to be expounded upon. The Holy One, blessed be He, told Gabriel [to take the coals], but he [Gabriel] asked the cherub to [take them first and then] give them to him so that the coals would cool and the decree would be mitigated. And this is clearly stated in the chapter (verse 7): “and he picked up [the fire] and gave [it] into the hands of the one clothed in linen.”
<b>and cast [them] upon the city</b> He did not cast them immediately, and although the one clothed in linen received them, he did not cast them until six years after he had received them, for the coals were smoldering in his hand for all the six years. And you should know [that this is true] because this prophecy was said in the sixth year, and the city was destroyed in the eleventh year.

<b>Noah, Daniel, and Job</b> Because each of these three saw three worlds: Noah saw the world built up, destroyed, and rebuilt; and Danielthe Temple. Or himself: first a prince over all the princes, eventually cast into a lions’ den, and [ultimately] restored to his greatness. Likewise, Job saw himself well-established, destroyed, and [again] well-established. Therefore, they were brought as a parallel to the generation of Jeconiah, which saw the Temple while it was built and while it was destroyed, and the [Temple’s] second building. And the Holy One, blessed be He, said the following to them: “I am showing you great affectionyou, Jeconiah and [those of] his exile. Should one of the lands of the nations sin against Me and had I decreed upon it one of these four punishmentseither “famine” (verse 13), “wild beast” (verse 15), “the sword” (verse 17), “or pestilence” (verse 19) as they appear in this chapter, consecutively, and these three righteous men were in its midst, they would save neither son nor daughter. Yet I will bring [all] four of them on [your brethren in] Jerusalem, and [still] leave over for you some of your sons who are there although you are not in its midst. And not because they are worthy of being saved, but to console you when they are exiled [to an area] near you and you will see their evil deeds and be consoled about the evil that I brought upon them. For you will see that it could no longer be tolerated. [The annotator of our ms. remarks:] (This is the theme of this entire chapter. This [following] explanation cannot be made fit, and it appears that it is not the wording of the rabbi [viz. Rashi]. It appears further that this edition [of Rashi in which this comment was found] is missing one of the four punishments, from אוֹ, or, until כִּי or.) Another explanation:
<b>If a land sins against Me, etc.</b> and had these three men been in its midst [namely] Noah, Daniel, and Job because the Holy One, blessed be He, saved these three men from these three [four] judgments, Scripture mentioned these. Noah was saved from the three of them. How do we know [that he was saved] from wild beasts? When he entered the ark, all the beasts attempted to enter, but the Holy One, blessed be He, did not allow them, as it is written (Gen. 7:16): “and the Lord shut around him.” Now the word “shut” refers only to protection from beasts, as Scripture states (Dan. 6:23): “and he shut the lions’ mouths, and they did not hurt me.”A lion came to enter [the ark] and its teeth were set on edge; a bear came to enter, and its feet would totter, etc. (see Gen. Rabbah 31:12). How do we know [that he was saved] from famine?For it is said (Gen. 5:29): “from the soil, which the Lord has cursed.” Go out and learn Genesis Rabbah (25:3) where it enumerates the ten famines that descended upon the world, and you will find that one of them was in the time of Noah, and it brings proof from “from the soil, which... [He] cursed.” From the swordthis is the Flood, and moreover, the people of his generation sought to attack him, saying, “We will not allow him to enter,” but the Holy One, blessed be He, saved him: said the Holy One, blessed be He, “I will not allow him to enter except at midday [in broad daylight], and whomever it hurtslet him protest.” That is what is written (Gen. 7:13): “In this very (עֶצֶם) day Noah came [into the ark]” at the strong point (עֱצוּמוֹ) of the day. Danielwhen Nebuchadnezzar entered the Temple in the days of Jehoiakim, he slew Jehoiakim and spared Daniel. He expelled Daniel [into] a peaceful exile because he found him to be full of a spirit of wisdom. From faminefor until Jerusalem was conquered in the days of Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar besieged it for three years [during which it suffered a famine], as is said (II Kings 25:3): “the famine became severe in the city,” and also (in Jer. 52:6): “and the famine became severe.” How do we know [that he was saved] from beasts?”and shut the lions’ mouths (Dan. ibid.), and they did not hurt me.” Likewise, you find that Job was saved from the three of them. How do we know [that he was saved] from famine?According to the one who says (Baba Bathra 15b) that Job lived in the time of Jacob, we find that there was a famine in his days. How do we know [that he was protected] from beasts?For it is written (Job 1:10): “and his cattle has broken out into the land.” It has breached the [natural] limitations of the world. [Usually wolves kill goats, but Job’s goats killed wolves; B. B. 15b.] How do we know [that he survived] the sword?(ibid. 16:13) “He splits my kidneys and does not have compassion.”
<b>Now should these three men be in its midst[namely] Noah, Daniel, and Job, they would save themselves with their righteousness.</b> Why are sons and daughters not mentioned [in verse 14] in regard to the death by faminei.e., it is not stated about them, “[as I lived] if they will save sons or daughters!”as they are mentioned in the last two punishments (verses 16, 18)? This is to depict Daniel, for he was one of those three saved from famine, he was of the generation of Jeconiah, and neither sons nor daughters were rescued with him. Concerning him Isaiah prophesied (56:4): “[For] so says the Lord to the to the eunuchs who will keep My Sabbaths.”

But Menachem (p. 131) explained בַּעֲדִי עֲדָיִם as related to the word עַד, eternity, as (Isa. 26:4): “Trust in the Lord forever (עֲדֵי עַד)”; enjusque a s(i)egle in Old French, to eternity [lit. for centuries]. Dunash (p. 83), however, interpreted it as a word for ornaments. The declension of עַדִי עֲדָיִם is one of the ten nouns: lion, lions (אֲרִי אֲרָיִם) ; deer [sing.], deer [pl.] (צְבִי צְבָיִם) ; kid, kids (גְדִי גְּדָיִם).

<b>and I anointed you</b> Heb. וָאֲסֻכֵך, a word expressing anointing. Now the entire episode is only a parable, and Jonathan explained it all, leaving nothing to add to the Targum, and he explained it in this manner:
<b>[3] Your dwelling place and your birthplace, etc.</b> Your dwelling place and your birthplace are from the land of the Canaanites; there I revealed Myself to your father Abraham [in the covenant] between the parts, and I let him know that you are going down to Egypt. With an arm raised on high, I redeemed you, and through the merit of your fathers, I drove out the Amorites and destroyed the Hittites.
<b>[4] And as for your birth, on the day you were born, etc.</b> And also, when your forefathers went down to Egypt, sojourners in a land that was not theirs, they subjugated them and oppressed them. The assembly of Israel was like a newborn infant abandoned in the open field, whose navel was not cut, and who was not rinsed with water to be cleansed, and not salted with salt or swaddled with swaddling clothes.
<b>[5] No eye pitied you, etc.</b> The eye of the wicked Pharaoh did not pity you to do you any favor, to lighten your bondage, [or] to have pity on you, and he decreed upon you a decree of annihilation, to cast your males into the river to destroy you at the time you were in Egypt.
<b>[6] And I passed by you, etc.</b> And the remembrance of the covenant of your forefathers came before Me. I revealed Myself to redeem you because it was known to Me that you were being oppressed in your bondage, and I said to you, “With the blood of the circumcision I shall spare you,” and I said, “With the blood of the Passover, I shall redeem you.”
<b>[7] Myriads, like the plants of the field I have made you</b> Myriads, as the plants of the field, I have made you, and you have increased and become strong, and you have become families and tribes, and with the good deeds of your forefathers, the time of the redemption of your assembly arrived because you were subjugated and oppressed.
<b>Myriads, like the plants of the field I made you</b> as it is said (Exod. 1:7): “And the children of Israel were fruitful and increased.”
<b>but you were naked and bare</b> of the commandments.
<b>[8] And I passed by you, etc</b> And I revealed Myself to Moses in the thorn bush because it was revealed to Me that the time of your redemption had arrived. I shielded you with My word, and I removed your sins, and I swore by My word to redeem you as I swore to your forefathers, said the Lord God, that you should be a people serving before Me.
<b>and I spread My skirt</b> The skirt of My garment.
<b>and I swore to you</b> (Exod. 6: 6): “Therefore (לָכֵן), say to the children of Israel: I am the Lord! I shall take you out, etc.” “Therefore” means only an [introduction to an] oath, as it is said (I Sam. 3:14): “therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli...”
<b>and came into a covenant with you</b> (Exod. 24:8): “Behold the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you.”
<b>[9] and I washed you with water</b> And I redeemed you from the bondage of the Egyptians, and I removed the strength of their lordship from you, and I led you to freedom.
@10
<b>And I clothed you with embroidered garments</b> “And I clothed you with embroidered garments of the spoils of your enemies.”
<b>and I shod you with badger</b> [Jonathan renders:] And I put shoes of glory on your feet.
<b>and I girded you</b> Heb. וָאֶחְבְּשֵּׁךּ. [Jonathan renders:] and I hallowed priests of you to be serving before Me with turbans of fine linen.
<b>and I covered you with silk</b> Heb. מֶשִּׁי, soie in French. And the High Priest with colored raiment, and [according to] Midrash Aggadah (Mid. Song 4:2), these are the seven clouds of glory, as it is written (Exod. 13:22): “He did not move (יָמִישּׁ) the pillar of cloud by day.”
@11
<b>And I adorned you with ornaments</b> E pare toy, and I adorned you. [Jonathan renders:] And I adorned you with the adornment of the words of the Torah, written on the two stone tablets.

<b>bracelets</b> Heb. צְמִידִים [from צמד, to join]. I joined one commandment opposite the other, five opposite five.
@12
<b>And I put a nose ring on your nose</b> [Jonathan renders:] And I placed the ark of My covenant among you.
<b>and earrings on your ears</b> Heb. וַעֲגִילִים, a word for an earring. [Jonathan interprets:] And the cloud of My glory covering over you. [The clouds of glory are called וַעֲגִילִים] because they surrounded them in a circle (עִגּוּל).
<b>and a crown of glory on your head</b> [Jonathan renders:] And an angel was sent from before Me leading at your head, as it is said (Micah 2:13): “and their king passed before them, and the Lord was at their head.”
@13
<b>And you adorned yourself with gold and silver</b> [Jonathan renders:] And I placed My Tabernacle among you, adorned with gold, silver, curtains of linen, colored tapestries and embroidery, and mannawhich was as good as fine flour, honey and oil—I fed you, and you became exceedingly rich and strong, and you prospered and ruled over all the kingdoms.
<b>fine flour, honey, and oil you ate</b> The manna, which would change to any flavorto fine flour, honey, and oilyou ate. The Midrash Aggadah (Mid. Song 4:2) [points out that] thirteen items are enumerated here, and corresponding to them, the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered them to bring the thirteen items enumerated in the donation for the Tabernacle (Exod. 25:1-7). Nevertheless, He is destined to repay them in the future with thirteen items (Isa. 4:5f.): “And the Lord shall create over every dwelling of Mount Zion, etc. And a tabernacle shall be for shade by day from the heat, etc., from stream and from rain, etc.”
<b>became exceedingly beautiful</b> An expression of beauty.
@14
<b>for it is all inclusive</b> Heb. כָּלִיל, an expression of all-inclusive beauty (23:12). Another explanation: כִּי כָּלִיל הוּא, for it was perfect. Another explanation: כִּי כָּלִיל couronne in French, like (Lev. 21: 12): “crown (נֵזֶר),” which is translated כְּלִיל by Targum.
@15
<b>and you went astray because of your fame</b> You relied on the fame of the beauty that spread concerning you.
<b>and you poured out your harlotries</b> You displayed your beauty to every passerby until the lust for your harlotry gushed upon them [arousing them] to seduce you into fornicating with them.
<b>to him it would be</b> And once they desired you, you surrendered yourself to them; and to anyone who requested your harlotry, it would be his. Jonathan renders: and it was not fitting for you to do so, as though it were written לֹא יְהִי. This entire allegory represents the Calf of the desert and the other idolatry that the tribe of Dan worshipped in the desert, as it is written (Deut. 25:18): “all those who trailed after you,” and we find in the Pesikta (d’Rav Kahana p. 27b): This is the tribe of Dan, for the cloud would reject them, because the were all idolators.

@19
<b>And My bread that I gave you</b> The day they made the Calf, the manna descended for them and they placed some of it before the Calf. Nonetheless, ‘so it was’ on the morrow, and it did not cease. Even this is delineated in the Book of Ezra (Neh. 9:18ff.): “Even when they made for themselves a molten calf, etc. And You, with Your manifold mercies, did not forsake them, etc., and You did not withhold Your manna from their mouth.” It was fitting to withhold it from them, yet You did not withhold it. [Scripture writes] here, too, “so it was, says the Lord God” the bread was, and it did not stop falling on the next day. So did Rabbi Tanchuma expound on it (Buber, Re’eh 13a).
@20
<b>that you bore for Me</b> If one had five sons, four of them were devoted to worshipping idols, and one he would set aside to attend school; and when he comes to offer up one of his sons to Molech, he offers up to it this one whom he had set aside to study Torahin the Midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma. But I say that “that you bore for Me” refers to the firstborn. Likewise, it is stated in this Book (20:26): “And I defiled them with their gifts, when they caused every one who opened the womb to pass.”

@29
<b>with the land of Canaan, with the Chaldeans</b> The Chaldeans were not from the land of Canaan, but this is its meaning: You added the images of the Chaldeans to those of the Canaanites, who were near you, and you played the harlot with them. However Jonathan rendered: You increased your harlotries with the Chaldeans and You became like the Canaanites, who were steeped in idolatry, and you increased your gods, joining the people of Canaan who follow the customs of the Chaldeans. But to me it appears that כְּנַעַן is like סוֹחֵר, a merchant, like (Hosea 12:8): “A trafficker (כְּנַעַן) who has deceitful scales in his hand.” He thus calls the land of the Chaldeans the land of the merchants, as it is said [concerning Babylon, too,] (17:4): “and he brought it to the land of merchants (כְּנַעַן), in a city of traffickers he placed it.”
@30

<b>If only you had gone in their ways</b> Heb. וְלֹא, if only you had gone in their ways and not committed abominations more than they. Likewise (II Kings 5:17): “Now if only (וָלֹֹא) your servant to be given.” Likewise (I Sam. 20:14): “And please, if (וְלֹא) I am still alive,” concerning Jonathan, et plut a in French, would that..., if only!
<b>so very little</b> Would your abominations have been before Me, had you not committed abominations more than they, but you dealt more corruptly than they. This is also Jonathan’s rendering. Others interpret וְלא בָּדֳרְכֵהֶן הָלֳכְתְּ as its apparent meaning, “and you did not go in their ways,” [and thus follows the reason:] So very little were their abominations in your eyes that you dealt more corruptly than they, pochet in Old French, a little.

<b>And they became haughty</b> She and her daughters, as is delineated in Job (28:5): “A land from which bread emerged,” and the entire piece (ibid. 4-9).

<b>but not from your covenant</b> But not because of your observance of the covenant that I made with you, but because of My kindnesses and My mercies, [namely] that I observe My covenant. Midrash Aggadah of Rabbi Tanchuma (Buber, Devarim 3a) states: but not from your covenant (מִבְּרִיתֵךְ) not from your ‘patromonia’: I did not grant them to Abraham your father [in the covenant] ‘between the segments’ (Gen. 15:1). This term is close to the French, for now, kinship is called patremone, patrimony, and this is what they call anything a person has from the inheritance of his fathers.

<b>when I forgive you</b> Heb. בְּכַּפְרִי לָךְ [lit. in my atoning to you]. When I forgive you for what you have done, you will be ashamed, and you will know that I did not benefit you because of the good that you bestowed upon Me.

<b>propound a riddle</b> The prophecy in this chapter is expressed as a riddle, [in] which he compares Nebuchadnezzar to an eagle and the kings of Judah to the lofty top of cedars.
@3
<b>long pinions</b> Heb. אֵבֶר like כָּנָף, wing, aile in French. Another explanation: as its apparent meaning, an expression of actual limbs.
<b>diverse colors</b> Heb. קָרְמָה [lit. embroidered]. Its feathers are beautiful and ornate.
<b>the lofty top of the cedar</b> Heb. צַמֶרֶת, all the foliage of the tree, cime in French. This is a parable representing Jehoiakim and his mighty men.
@4
<b>He plucked the top of its branches</b> Heb. יְנִיקוֹתָיו. He humbled his [Jehoiakim’s] greatness and his monarchy. יְנִיקוֹתָיו is like עַנָפָיו, its branches.
<b>and brought to a land of merchants</b> Heb. כְּנַעַן, to a land of merchants; that is Babylon.
@5
<b>Then he took of the seed of the land</b> Zedekiah his son.
<b>in a fertile field</b> [lit. in a field of seed.] In Jerusalem, in the capital city.
<b>it took [root] beside abundant waters</b> Heb. קַח, it took. It became rooted beside abundant waters, i.e., he gave him greatness and dominion over his surroundings.
<b>a mountain willow he made it</b> Heb. צַפְצָפָה, a species of willow tree which has many branches, saice in Old French, a willow.

@7
<b>Now there was one...eagle</b> The king of Egypt.
<b>gathered its roots</b> Heb. כָּפְנָה, an expression of hunger, like (Job 5:22): “plunder and famine (וּלְכָפָן).” The roots of this vine hungered and longed for that eagle. (Addendum:) Some explain כָּפְנָה like אָסְפָה, gathered, the letters [of כָּפְנָה] being transposed. In the words of our Sages there is something similar to it, for they call a public gathering כְּנוּפְיָא. כָּפְנָה is like כָּנְפָה, amassa in French, brought in, gathered.
<b>and its tendrils it sent forth to him</b> And her emissaries she sent to him, to come to her and water her.
<b>from the furrows of its planting</b> From the water ditches that the first eagle had made for it.
@8
<b>In a good field, etc.</b> i.e., she did this for no purpose, because she had been planted in a good field.
<b>a sturdy vine</b> Heb. אַדָרֶת, a sturdy vine.

<b>Say</b> The entire Hebrew alphabet is found in this verse, and I am puzzled that it is not listed in the Masorah.
<b>[Will he not] pull up its roots</b> The first eagle.
<b>and cut off its fruits</b> Heb. יְקוֹסֵס, like יְקוֹצֵץ, will cut off. They are Zedekiah’s sons, whom he slaughtered before his eyes.

<b>And not with great power and many people</b> will the second eagle come to their assistance.
<b>against those who rip it out by its roots</b> Against those who uproot and pull it out by its roots.

<b>And behold</b> now it is planted as they wished.
<b>will it prosper</b> Is it possible that it will prosper, this one that betrayed the one who planted it originally?
@12
<b>what these are</b> What this riddle is, and he explained it to them.

@18
<b>he gave his hand</b> He promised in good faith and raised his hand in a covenant.
@19
<b>I will bring it upon his head</b> [lit. put it in his head.] That is the blinding of his eyes.
@20

<b>and contend</b> And I will debate with him.
@21
<b>And all his fugitives</b> Heb. מִבְרָחָיו. According to Targum, and all his mighty men. But Menachem (p. 48) associated it with (Song 8:10): “Flee (בְּרַח) my beloved,” and this is its interpretation: and all those who fled.
<b>with all his wings</b> Heb. אַגַפָּיו with all their wings, i.e., with all their strength they will fall by the sword.

@22

<b>a tender one</b> It is customary to graft only from the tender [sprigs] that grew the previous year, called grayfe in Old French, a shoot, graft.
<b>and lofty</b> Heb. וְתָלוּל, from the word mound, תֵּל, for a mound is usually high and lofty; amonceler in French, to heap up.
@23
<b>shall they dwell</b> Heb. תִּשְּׁכֹּנָה. The ‘dagesh’ in the ‘nun’ serves instead of a second ‘nun,’ as though it were written תִּשּׁכֹּנְנָה.
@24
<b>I...have lowered the high tree</b> The nations that were ruling over Israel.
<b>I have dried up the green tree</b> Zedekiah and his seed.

So is the way of the Holy One, blessed be He: the fathers sin and the children are punished, for the kings of Israel sinned for many years before they were exiled, and we too need not be concerned that we shall be punished for our iniquities.

<b>And she raised up one of her cubs</b> This lamentation was said regarding the sons of Josiah. The first is Jehoahaz.
<b>he devoured men</b> Heb. אָדָם. He robbed Israel, for Israel is called אָדָם, man, as is stated (below 34:31): “And you are My flock, the flock of My pasture; you are men,” and according to the allegory, any beast that tasted human flesh will always provoke humans.

@7
<b>And he was intimate with their widows</b> He would rape the women and kill their husbands. Some interpret אַלְמְנוֹתָיו like אַרְמְנוֹתָיו [their palaces] and וַיֵדַע as an expression of destruction and ruin, as in (Ps. 138:6): “and He chastises (יְיֵדָע) the haughty from afar.”
<b>and their cities he laid waste</b> For he levied a tax on the land to give Pharaoh annually, as it is said in II Kings (23:35).
@8
<b>And nations gathered around against him from provinces</b> (II Kings 24:2): “And the Lord incited against him bands of Chaldeans, bands of Arameans, and bands of Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon.” “And nations gathered against him.” וַיִתְּנוּ [is rendered by Jonathan as:] and they gathered.

<b>to inquire of the Lord</b> concerning their needs, and if He does not listen to us, neither will we be punished for the sins in our hands, for He has already sold us, and He has nothing on us. If a master has sold his slave, or a husband has divorced his wife, does one have anything on the other? And from the conclusion of the matter you learn [this], from the reply that he gave them (verse 32): “What enters your thoughts, etc.”
@3
<b>I will not be inquired of by you!</b> in your request. Yet at the end of this Book (36:37): He says: “I will...be inquired of by the house of Israel.” This is one of the places that teach us that the Holy One, blessed be He, recants on evil. And regarding matters similar to this, it is said (Num. 23:19): “He says but He does not do.” Midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma (Vayera 13).
@4
<b>Will you contend with them</b> Heb. הֲתִישְׁפֹּט, an expression of contending.
@5
<b>On the day I chose Israel</b> This hatred was pent up before the Omnipresent close to nine hundred yearsfrom [the days] that they were in Egypt until [those of] Ezekielbut His love had shielded them. Now that they had increased their transgressions, though, it was awakened, and concerning this it is stated (Prov. 10:12): “Hatred arouses quarrels [but love covers up all transgressions].”
@7
<b>And I said to them</b> Aaron proclaimed this prophecy to them before the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself to Moses in the thorn bush. This is what was said to Eli (I Sam. 2:27): “Did I appear to the house of your father when they were in Egypt, etc.?”
@8
<b>But they rebelled against Me</b> They are the wicked, the majority of Israel, who died in the three days of darkness, as it is said (Exod. 13:18): “and the children of Israel went out of Egypt, (חֲמֻשִּׁים)”one out of fifty, and some say, one out of five hundred.
@9
<b>that it should not be desecrated</b> That My Name should not be desecrated; since I became known to them and I promised to take them out, and the Egyptians recognized that they are My people, if I were to destroy them their enemies would say, “Because He has not the ability to take them out.”
@12

<b>and My Sabbaths they desecrated</b> Some of the people went out to gather manna.
@21
<b>But the children rebelled against Me</b> The tribe of Dan, and likewise those who became attached to Baal Peor after the generation of the wilderness had died out.
@23
<b>to scatter them</b> Back then, I promised them to scatter them (Deut. 4:25ff.): “When you will beget children and children’s children, etc. [the Lord will scatter you among the nations, etc.].”
@25
<b>statutes that were not good</b> I delivered them into the hands of their temptation to stumble over their iniquity, and so did Jonathan render: And I delivered them into the hands of their foolish temptation, and they went and made decrees that were not good, and practices by which they cannot live.
@26
<b>And I defiled them with their gifts</b> Those gifts that I legislated for themto hallow for Me every firstborn—I delivered them into the hands of their temptation: to pass those firstborn to the Molech. Hence the statutes that are not good.
<b>in order that I lay them desolate</b> Heb. אֲשְּׁמֵם. I shall lay them desolate and destroy them. אֲשְּׁמֵם, is an expression of שְּׁמָמָה, desolation. Whoever explains it as an expression of אַשְּׁמָה, guilt, errs, because the ‘aleph’ is not part of the radical.
<b>that they know</b> when I will bring upon them the evil.
@27

@31
<b>And when you take your gifts</b> And with the taking of your gifts that you should have given Me, and you take them from Me to cause your firstborn to pass to idols.
@32
<b>But what enters your mind</b> Heb. והעלה על-רוחכם [lit. what ascends upon your spirit], what ascends upon your mind.
<b>‘Let us be like the nations’</b> Let us break off His yoke from our necks since He sent us away from Him.
<b>shall not come about</b> For you already accepted upon yourselves of your own free will in the days of Joshua, as it is written (Josh. 24:1): “And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel,” and the entire episode.
@35
<b>the wilderness of the peoples</b> That is the wilderness through which they [the children of Israel] traveled for forty years, and so did Hosea prophesy (2:16): “and I will...lead her into the desert.” That is the desert of Sihon and Og. Ezekiel called it the wilderness of the peoples because many nations bordered upon it.
@37
<b>under the rod</b> That you shall be subordinate to Me and to My chastisement.
<b>into the transmission of the covenant</b> The covenant that I transmitted to you.
@38
<b>And I shall separate</b> Heb. וּבָרוֹתִי, an expression of ברד [selecting, separating].
<b>from the land of their sojournings</b> From the land of their exile I shall take them and slay them in the wilderness.
@39
<b>go worship</b> and do not show the nations that you are called by My Name by coming to the prophet to inquire of him [about the] Torah, and, after he tells you My words, not hearkening to Me, as the matter that is stated (33:32): “And behold you are to them like the song of the flutes, etc.” They hear your words, but they do not carry them out.
<b>with your gifts and with your idols</b> For you separate the first born to be designated as a firstborn as I commanded you, but once My Name is called upon the thing, you sacrifice them to idols.
@40
<b>and the first of your food</b> Heb. מַשְׂאוֹתֵיכֶם, like מִשְׁאַרוֹתֵיכֶם your kneading troughs, an expression of food, like (Exod. 21:10): “her food (שְּׁאֵרָה), her clothing, or her conjugal rights shall not be diminished.” Menachem also (p. 168) associated it in this manner.
@43
<b>and you will quarrel</b> Heb. וּנְקֹטֹתֶם, an expression of quarreling (קְטָטָה). Another explanation, following the Targum: וְתִּידַנְקוּן, and so does Jonathan render (9:4) הַנֶאֱנָחִים: “and those who groan,” demonir in Old French, to melt away.

<b>all faces from the south to the north</b> All the people south of Babylon, which is to the north. וְנִצְרְבוּ, shall be scorched, comes from צרב (as Lev. 13:2), retrere in Old French, to shrivel up.
@5
<b>‘Is he not an inventor of parables’</b> when I prophesy to them in language of parable and riddle, such as a forest and a fire consuming [trees] moist and dry.

<b>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying</b> Prophesy to them a clear prophecy. What I said to you, “Set your face southward,” I explain to you: “Set your face toward Jerusalem.”
@7
<b>and prophesy</b> Heb. וְהַטֵף, and prophesy. Similarly (Micah 2:6): “Preach (תַטִיפוּ) not”; (Amos 7: 16), “and do not prophesy (תַטִיף) concerning the house of Isaac.”
<b>about the sanctuaries</b> That is the forest of the field. “Sanctuaries” denotes the two destructions.
@8
<b>righteous and wicked</b> That is “the moist and the dry.”
@9
<b>Since I cut off from you</b> and I knew that the nations would rejoice at your misfortune, I shall be wroth with them and incite Nebuchadnezzar against all of them, and that is what I wrote, “and all faces from the south will be scorched.”
@14
<b>A sword, a sword</b> Two swords: the sword of the king of Babylon first, and afterwards the sword of the children of Ammon in the hand of Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, who will slay Gedaliah and those gathered to him of the survivors of the sword, as is delineated in Jeremiah (41:1-10).
<b>furbished</b> Heb. מְרוּטָה, forbide in Old French, furbished, polished. Menachem (p. 120), however, associated it as an expression of drawing. Likewise (verse 16): “and He gave it to draw (לְמָרְטָה),” and so all of them.
@15
<b>that it may glitter</b> Heb. בָּרָק, to have a glitter, a shine, flandours, a flash, flashing (as in Deut 32: 41).
<b>Shall we rejoice?</b> This is a rhetorical question. Do we have anything more to be happy about?
<b>The rod for My son disdains every stick</b> The rod with which I strike My son to chastise him is the hardest of all rods, and it disdains the blow of every staff and every stick, for they are like nothing to it.
@16
<b>Then he had it</b> the rod.
<b>furbished to grasp in the hand</b> To furbish it so that it be easy and fit to grasp with the hand.
<b>that is the sword that was sharpened</b> That is the rod; it is a sharp and furbished sword, to give it into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar to slay with it.
@17
<b>and wail</b> Heb. וְהֵילֵל, a term for wailing (יְלָלָה).
<b>for it</b> The sword will be upon My people and upon their princes and officers.
<b>those gathered to the sword</b> Heb. מְגוּרֵי, a gathering of nations coming to the sword were around My people. So did Jonathan render מְגוּרֵי, related to the word in (Prov. 10: 5): “An intelligent son gathers (אוֹגֵר) in the summer”; (ibid. 6:8), “She gathers (אָגְרָה) her food in the harvest”; (Joel 1:17), “garners (מַמְּגֻרוֹת) are demolished”; (Haggai 2:19), “The seed is still in the granary (בַּמְגוּרָה).” Menachem, however, connected it to the word for fear, like (Num. 22:3): “And Moab became terrified (וַיָגָר).”
<b>therefore, clap upon your thigh</b> as a wailing and a lament.
@18
<b>For a test</b> For a great test, with torments in many other forms of retribution, they were tested: the rod, pestilence, famine, and wild beasts.
<b>and what of it, if there be also a rod that disdains—He will not be</b> And what more will be on My son if also this disdainful rod comes upon him with the rest of the test?
<b>He will not be</b> My son will no longer be in the world. Jonathan also rendered it “they will not exist,” but the rest of the verse he did not render in this [i.e., Rashi’s] way, but so it appears to me. I heard many explanations for it, and I saw [others] in books of interpretations, but they did not appear correct to me, and the ‘payat’ who composed for Chanukah [for the morning of the first Sabbath]: “That which disdained all wood stabbed the adulterer,” supports me, for he called the sword “that which disdained all wood.” Jonathan rendered in this manner: (verse 15) אוֹ נָשִׂישׂ. because the tribe of the house of Judah and Benjamin rejoiced at the tribes of Israel when they were exiled for worshipping idols, and they returned to stray after wooden images. He, too, explains אוֹ נָשִׂישׂ as a rhetorical question.
<b>For a test</b> and what if also a rod that disdains He will not be [Jonathan renders:] “For the prophets prophesied about them but they did not repent.” That is to say, the matter is already determined that they will not repent. And what will be their end?
<b>if also a disdainful rod? He will not be</b> He [Jonathan] says: “And also the tribes of the house of Judah and Benjamin will be exiled, and with their evil deeds, they not [continue to] exist.” The kingdom of the tribe that disdained its fellow and scorned them and the evil that befell themshe too will not be and will not endure. I shall further interpret it in another manner:
<b>Or shall we rejoice, etc.</b> Or perhaps we should rejoice, for you say to Me that the tribe of My son disdains all wood: The kings of Judah disdain idolatry, as we find with Abijah, who said (II Chron. 13:8): “and with you are the golden calves,” and Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah, who abolished all the idolatry in the world that was under their control, and these [the remaining tribes] too will repent.
<b>Cry and wail</b> and do not rejoice over this, for it will be upon My people. And why?
<b>Because it is tested</b> The matter is already tested and determined before Me that they will not repent properly.
<b>And what if even they disdain wood, it will not be</b> And what if I wait longer? Even if they came to repent and to disdain idolatry, the matter would not last with them because they would hasten to revert to their wickedness. That is what is said in Jeremiah (8: 4): “if he repents, will he not return?”
@19
<b>prophesy and clap your hands one upon the other</b> in the manner of those who lament, and what is the prophecy?
<b>and a third sword shall be doubled</b> I said, “A sword, a sword”; Nebuchadnezzar’s sword to destroy Jerusalem and the sword of the children of Ammon upon Gedaliah. There is yet a third sword, doubled as much as these two, and it shall be a sword of the slain; that is the sword of the great slaughter, which causes many slain to fall.
<b>which penetrates to them</b> Wherever you go out, it will pursue you into the innermost chambers. Behold, Johanan the son of Kareah and the generals of the armies will go to Egypt; there the sword will overtake them, and so in all the place from which they will flee, to the fortified cities, as it is stated in this piece: “by all your cities I gave the scream of the sword.”
@20
<b>In order to melt</b> Heb. לָמוּג, an expression of moving. Another explanation: an expression of something melting.
<b>and to increase the stumbling blocks</b> Heb. וְהַרְבֵּה, and to increase the stumbling blocks, and so every הַרְבֵּה in Scripture is an expression of increasing, an infinitive.
<b>the scream of the sword</b> Heb. אִבְחֳת. Some interpret [this as] טִבְחַת, the slaughter of, the ‘teth’ in place of the ‘aleph,’ by the code of א"ט ב"ח [whereby ‘aleph’ is interchangeable with ‘teth,’ ‘beth’ with ‘cheth,’ etc.] [This appears to be Jonathan’s interpretation.] Others interpret it as אִבְעַת an expression of בְּעָתָה [fright], but this cannot be because the ‘tav’ in אִבְחֳת is not part of the radical, and it comes only for the construct state, whereas the ‘tav’ in בְּעָתָה is a radical. Therefore, I say that אִבְחֳתחֶרֶב means the sounding of the voice of those slain by the sword, an expression of barking (נְבִיחָה) glapissement in French, yelping, for the ‘nun’ in נְבִיחָה is a defective radical, like the ‘nun’ in נְשִּׁיכָה biting, and the ‘aleph’ comes in its place, like (Job 13:17): “and...my speech (אַחְוָתִי) in your ears”; (II Kings 4:2), “except a jug (אָסוּךְ) of oil.” Menachem (p. 12) explained it as fear of the sword. It has no counterpart, but is interpreted according to the context.
<b>Woe, it is made to glitter</b> Alas and alack! For it is made into a furbished and polished blade.
<b>enwrapped for the slaughter</b> And enwrapped in a cloth until it would be grasped in the hand for slaughter on the day of war. Some interpret מְעֻטָה as a form of the word for diminishing (מִעוּט), for it diminishes when they sharpen it, but it is an error that they have made, for the absence of the ‘vav’ and the ‘dagesh’ in the ‘teth’ indicate about it that the ‘mem’ is not a radical, [but,] like the ‘mem’ of מְעֻנָה, afflicted, מְעֻטָה, enwrapped, and (Songs 5:14) מְעֻלֶפֶת, “overlaid with sapphires.” Menachem (p. 132) associated it as an expression of thought, like (Dan. 2:14): “answered with counsel (עֵטָא) and discretion.” Dunash, however, interprets it (p. 78) like (Ps. 104:2): “[You] enwrap (עֹטֶה) Yourself with light like a garment.”

<b>I, too, shall clap My hands</b> I say to you, “Clap your hands one upon the other,” and “I, too,” like you, lament over them, and I “shall clap My hands” one upon the other, but My fury burns within Me, “and I shall give it rest.”

<b>make for yourself two roads</b> as He concludes the [next] verse.
<b>and clear a place; at the head of the road to the city</b> Clear for yourself a place at the head of the road you are on, and make for yourself a sort of road opening into the crossroads, one facing right and one facing left.
<b>both of them will emanate</b> The two roads.
<b>and clear a place</b> A place cleared of the thorns and the thistles; [בָּרִא is like] essarter in French, to clear. A word similar to it appears in the Book of Joshua (17:15): “then go up to the forest, and clear it (וּבֵרֵאתָ) for yourself there.” Again (ibid. verse 18): “But the mountain shall be yours, for it is a forest, and you shall cut it down (וּבֵרֵאתוֹ).” Menachem connected them all (p. 48) as an expression of choosing, like (I Sam. 17:8): “Choose (בְּרוּ) for yourselves a man”; בָּרֵא meaning lisant in Old French, choosing, appointing.
@25
<b>You shall make a road for the coming, etc.</b> These two roads symbolize the king of Babylon, who is leaving his country with the intention of going either to Jerusalem or to Rabbah of the children of Ammon. To whichever of the two of them the lot will fall for him by his divinations, he will march, as is delineated (verse 26): “For the king of Babylon stood, etc.”
@26
<b>the crossroads</b> Heb. אֵם הַדֶרֶךְ, carrefour in French, crossroads.
<b>he furbished the arrows</b> Heb. קִלְקַל, he furbished the arrows with a glitter. He shot an arrow upward, and it turns by itself right or left, and to the place it turns—that is the lot.
<b>he flashed with the arrows</b> Menachem (p. 155), connected it with (above 1:7): “burnished (קָלָל) copper”; (Ecc. 10:10): “and he did not sharpen (קִלְקֵל) the edge.” It may also be explained as an expression of deterioration, as in (Jer. 4:24): “and all the hills deteriorated (הִתְקַלְקָלוּ).” Some translate קִלְקַל into French, as trait, he shot, and Jonathan as well renders קִלְקַל בֲּחִצִים as קְשֲּׁתבְּגִרְרֲיָא.

<b>And it was to them</b> To Israelwhat Nebuchadnezzar did.
<b>like a false divination</b> and they will not believe that he would succeed, but indeed, they had seven sevens. Nebuchadnezzar divined forty-nine times, and all the divinations coincided exactly.
<b>and he brings iniquity to be remembered in order that they be seized</b> And Nebuchadnezzar, in his divinations, would cause the iniquities that Israel committed to be remembered, for Ammon and Moab, their neighbors, would make them known to him because they would hear the reproofs of the prophets.
<b>in order that they be seized</b> [lit. to be seized.] That Israel be seized in his hand.
@29

<b>I shall remove the turban and lift off the crown, etc.</b> This is to be explained as the Targum renders: I shall remove the turban from Seraiah the High Priest, and I shall abolish the crown from King Zedekiah. He said: Neither this nor that will remain in its place.
<b>the humble will be uplifted</b> Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to whom it did not belong, will take it, and Zedekiah, to whom it did belongit will be taken from him.
@32
<b>A ruin, a ruin</b> Heb. עַוָה, an expression of (Micah 1:6): “a heap (עִי) in the field,” an expression of ruin after ruin, two and three times, I shall make it: It was already taken from Jeconiah and given to Zedekiah, and from Zedekiah it will be given to Gedaliah; this makes twice. Menachem (p. 131) connected עַוָה with (Esther 1:16): “has Vashti the queen done wrong (עָוְתָה)?”; (Ps. 106:5), “we have committed iniquity (הֶעֱוִינוּ) and wickedness.”
<b>this too will not be</b> Also, to Gedaliah it will not remain, [only] until Ishmael the son of Nethaniah [the assassin] comes.
<b>until he who has the judgment</b> Upon whom I placed [the mission] to exact My vengeance and My judgment.

<b>in order to glitter</b> In order that its shiny appearance should not be darkened by its slain ones.
@34
<b>When you prophesy vanity for yourself</b> The diviners of Ammon prophesied vanity for themselves, saying, “Nothing more will come upon us.”
<b>to place you with the necks of the slain of the wicked</b> To mislead you and to place your neck like the necks of the slain of the wicked of Israel.
<b>whose day has come, etc.</b> Heb. יוֹמָם, their day.
@35
<b>It has been returned</b> Heb. הָשֵּׁב, like שָּׁבָה, it has returned, because the ‘shin’ has no ‘dagesh.’ [The missing ‘dagesh’ indicates that no letter is missing; hence, the root is שוּב, return, rather than ישב, sit or dwell.] Wait until the sword that is upon Israel returns into its sheath, and afterward, when he has finished His revenge upon Israel, He will return upon you, and in the place you were created, etc.
@36
<b>I shall blow upon you</b> Heb. אָפִּיחָ, an expression for blowing fire with a bellows.
<b>brutish men</b> Who behave madly to ruin and to destroy.
<b>craftsmen of destruction</b> Artisans of murder. (Already many days [have passed] since I explained this chapter as it is written above. Now I see from the peculiarities of its wording that the prophet is talking only about the sword.) “To place you upon the necks of the slain of the wicked,” “It has been returned to its sheath, etc.” “I shall blow upon you.” This wording is appropriate only for metal, and so “craftsmen of destruction.” It seems to me that this prophecy was stated about Nebuchadnezzar, and so it appears [from]: “prophesy and say: So said the Lord God concerning the children of Ammon and concerning their taunts.” That is to say, [their taunts] over Nebuchadnezzar [because of Nebuchadnezzar], for the children of Ammon were taunting Israel because Nebuchadnezzar destroyed them. [33]
<b>Sword, drawn sword</b> The sword of Nebuchadnezzar, which is double, to go out on the two waysagainst Jerusalem and against the children of Ammon, as is delineated in the above chapterthus the retribution on the children of Ammon. [34]
<b>When you prophesy for yourself, when you divine lies for yourself</b> You think that through your divinations of vanity, futility, and lies, you will prosper, for your sword is placed upon the necks of the slain of the wicked, whose day has come by decree from before Me at the time of the payment at the time of their end. [35]
<b>It has been returned to its sheath</b> That is to say, the time will come that the sword will return to its sheath, and the sword will receive its own retribution, at the hands of the kings of Media, and then I shall blow upon you with the fire of My wrath, and you shall be delivered into the hands of mad blacksmiths, who are craftsmen of destruction, who will come to sharpen and to furbish it as of yore, and they will destroy you.

Another explanation: וַתְּבַצְעִי is a form of a word for robbery, like (Ps. 10:3): “and the robber (וּבֹצֵעַ) blesses himself for having blasphemed the Lord.” Accordingly, its interpretation is: and you robbed your friends with affliction.

Although Samaria was not built until the days of Omri, He calls the kings of Israel by its name, because as soon as it was built, it became the capital.
<b>Oholibah</b> Because My tent (אֹהֹלִי) was in her (בָה), and My sanctuary.
@5
<b>and she lusted</b> [Heb. וַתַּעְגַּב,] and she lusted, esvayer or eswaier in Old French, to covet, to lust after. Some editions read: desirer, to desire.
<b>for the Assyrians, who were nearby</b> Who were her neighbors, and they sent to them [requesting that they] aid them. This is Menachem the son of Gadi (II Kings 15: 19f.), who gave tribute to Pul king of Assyria in order “that his hands might be with him to strengthen the kingdom in his hand.” The prophet likens the matter to an adulterous woman, for, had they worshipped the Holy One, blessed be He, they would not have needed the kings of Assyria.

Menachem (p. 97) explains [טְבוּלִים] like (Gen. 37: 31) “and dipped (וַיִטְבְּלוּ) the shirt in the blood.” Thus the interpretation of סְרוּחֵי טְבוּלִים is as follows (Exod. 26:12): “The overhanging (וְסֵרַח) length” of the dyed turban. There is no [other occurrence of a word] similar to טְבוּלִים, and its meaning is derived from the context, and so did Jonathan render: helmets placed on their heads].

<b>And the children of Babylon came to her for a bed of love</b> They made a covenant together, and I say that this is said concerning Hezekiah, who rejoiced about the emissaries of Merodach-baladan (Isa. 39, II Kings 20), and he fed them at his table and showed them his entire treasure house. This resembles the prophet’s statement (verse 14), “men engraved on the wall,” because they came from a distant land, and the Chaldeans were not frequent visitors to them, as it is said (Isa. 39:3): “They have come to me from a distant country,” and from seeing their faces once, they became endeared to him. And the Holy One, blessed be He, became wroth with him because of this matter, as it is written (Isa. 36:6, II Kings 20:17): “Behold a time will come when everything in your palace...will be carried off, etc.,” and in (II) Chronicles (32:25): “But Hezekiah did not pay back according to the benefit they had done for him, but his heart became haughty; therefore, wrath came upon him and upon Judah, etc.”
<b>her soul was disgusted with them</b> [Heb. וַתֵּקַע.] That Jehoiakim and Zedekiah rebelled against them. וַתֵּקַע is esloched in Old French, dislocated. וַתֵּקַע is like (Gen. 32: 26): “and the upper joint of Jacob’s thigh was dislocated (וַתֵּקַע).” הוֹקָעָה is an expression of joining and inserting a pole into the earth, and also when it is withdrawn from the earth, is the expression קְעִיָה appropriate for it, just as you say (Ps. 80:10): “it took root (וַתַשְׁרֵשׁ),” as an expression of taking root, and (Job 31:12), “and it uproots (תְּשָׁרֵשׁ) all my grain,” as an expression of uprooting. Similarly (Isa. 17:6): “on its branches (בִּסְעִפֶיהָ) when it produces fruit,” is an expression of branches, and (ibid. 10:33), “lops off (מְסָעֵף) the branches,” is an expression of cutting off the branches of the tree and its boughs.

<b>weapons</b> [Heb. הֹצֶן]. Dunash (p. 59) explained it as one type of weapon, but I say that it is an expression of the surroundings of camps like (Num. 33:55): “and camps (וְלִצְנִינִים) in your sides,” [which Onkelos renders:] and camps surrounding you. Menachem (p. 150) explains הֹצֶן like (Ps. 91:4): “His truth is an encompassing shield (צִנָה וְסֹחֵרָה), but Dunash does not agree with him, and the Targum supports Dunash, rendering: they will come upon you with weapons. הֹצֶן is like בְּהֹצֶן, with weapons, and הֹצֶן could mean the same as חֹצֶן, from (Isa. 49:22): “and they shall bring your sons בְּחֹצֶן,”which means with the arm, and so too: “And they will come upon you הֹצֶן,” meaning [as with] an army, as (Dan. 11:15), “and the arms (וּזְרוֹעוֹת) of the south,” meaning the armies of the south.

So will it be that once their salvation comes and the cup breaks, He will not return to give them any more to drink. When He speaks of giving drink to the nations, however, He calls it gold, as it is said (Jer. 51:7): “Babylon is a golden cup in the Lord’s hand, it intoxicates all the earth.”

He scrapes with his teeth around the bone or the shard to detach from it the meat adhering to it. Menachem (p. 59) connects it to an expression of breaking, and he interprets: “and he breaks their bones,” and “they did not break the bones for morning,” in like manner.

<b>of the many people</b> who were in her midst, who were brought to commit adultery, from the desert.
<b>those dwelling all around</b> [Heb. סָבָאִים,] people who lived around her. Of her neighbors, Ammon and Moab, and so did [Jonathan] render סָבָאִים “from all around.”
<b>they placed</b> Oholah and Oholibah [placed] bracelets on their hands to adorn themselves in order to commit adultery; i.e., Ammon and Moab, since they are many, she adorns and beautifies herself for them, and because they are her neighbors, she beautifies herself before their eyes with her ornaments; therefore, Oholah and Oholibah put bracelets on their hands in order to be beautiful in the eyes of the adulterers. The “vav” of וַיִתְּנוּ is superfluous, like that of (Exod. 15:2): “The strength and the cutting of God was (וַיְהִי) my salvation,” and like that of (ibid. 9:21): “But whoever did not take the word of the Lord to heart left (וַיַעֲזֹב).”

<b>will end</b> [Heb. יִזְנוּ] will leave. Every “harlot” (זוֹנָה) is translated into Aramaic as נֳפְקֲתבְּרָא, one who goes out. So did I hear, and so did Jonathan render.
<b>of the one who had aged [in] adulteries</b> like: [lit. to the one who had aged adulteries,] the one who had aged in adulteries, as you say (Gen. 38:11): “and she remained her father’s house,” is like “in her father’s house”; (Exod. 30:20), “they shall wash water,” is like “they shall wash with water.” [Likewise,] (ibid.): “And he shall go out freedom;” [and] (Num. 30:11): “But if she made a vow [in] her father’s house.” So did Dunash (p. 17) explain [this]. However, Menachem connected it (p. 45) to (Lev 20:12): “they committed a disgraceful act (תֶּבֶל),” but his words are impossible.

<b>Set the pot</b> [Heb. שְׂפֹת, set.] On the mouth of the stove on the place where it is set. That is called שְׂפִיתָה in Mishnaic Hebrew, for our Rabbis said (Shab. 38b): “[A stove has] a place for the setting of ] שְׂפִיתַת[two pots.” We learned also (Beizah 34a): “If one sets the pot, one puts in water, and one puts in the condiments...” We learn that is the placing it on the mouth of the stove before they put anything into it. This figure represents Jerusalem, about which you said, “It is the pot.” Now the time has come for it to become a pot, and you will become the meat inside it, and Nebuchadnezzar is coming and will put in on the fire. Menachem (p. 179) explained it as an expression of placing.

@5
<b>Take the choice of the flocks</b> You, Nebuchadnezzar, take the choicest of your armies around it. So did Jonathan render, but this does not fit with the idea of the pot. This must therefore be interpreted to mean that the choicest of Israel will come and enter into its midst.
<b>and also arrange the limbs under it</b> [Heb. דוּר,] an expression of arranging, and so (Isa. 22:18): “He shall wind you around like a turban, like a surrounding wall (כַּדוּר),” a row of surrounding troops. A row (דוּרָה) is translated into Aramaic as דַּרָא. However, Menachem explains it (p. 67) as (verse 9): “Even I shall enlarge the fire (הַמְדוּרָה) .”

<b>and its filth</b> Its filth, which they remove from its surface by boiling it, is called escume in Old French, foam, ecume in Modern French. This means: the wicked within her have not come out.
<b>limb by limb</b> Exile after exile, who went out and defected to the Chaldeans, every man by himself.
<b>no lot has fallen on it</b> Not like other pots, whose pieces they take out all at once in order to place before each one his portion and his lot. Jonathan renders: because they did not repent within it. [Therefore,] the lot of the Omnipresent did not fall on it.
@7
<b>smooth</b> [Heb. צְחִיחַ,] smoothness.
<b>she did not pour it out on the ground, etc.</b> Jonathan paraphrased: with willful wickedness and with an arm raised on high did she shed it; she did not shed it unintentionally to repent of it. Our Rabbis (Git. 57b, Pesikta d’Rav Kahana 122a) explained it as referring to the blood of Zechariah the son of Jehoiada. They did not treat it as the blood of the deer or the blood of the gazelle.

<b>and prepare the mixture</b> When the meat is consumed off the bones and it shrivels and becomes mingled with the liquid, and one stirs it with a spoon, it resembles a mixture of a compounding of spices, which they mix very thoroughly; and through the shriveling of the meat, its smoke is turned back into it, which is called aorser in Old French, to burn. And this is what [the following verse] says:
<b>and the bones will be scorched</b> [Heb. יִחָרוּ.] They will be cooked and smoked, an expression of (Job 30:30): “dried out (חָרָה) from the heat.” Similarly (verse 11), “in order that it be heated, that its base be scorched (וְחַרָה),” as happens with a pot whose water has evaporated through its boiling: it heats up, its shards burn, and the cooked food spoils.

Similarly, flutes for a bride and for the dead.
<b>and stamped</b> [Heb. וְרַקְעֲךָ,] an expression of stamping.
<b>with all the disdain</b> [Heb. שָּׁאטְךָ,] interpreted as an expression of disdain, like (Gen. 25:34): “and Esau despised,” which Onkelos renders: וְשָׁט, but I say that שָּׁאטְךָ is an expression of lust, golozemant or golosement in Old French, ardent desire, gluttony.

<b>Behold the house of Judah is like all the nations</b> The love of the Holy One, blessed be He, has been annulled from them, and they are rejected, to be given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar like the other nations.

Rabbah, Proem 9) [says] that they entered the Temple and peeled off the pictures of the cherubim that Solomon had painted on the wall of the Temple (I Kings 7:36): “according to the attachment of a man and the joining, etc.” They took them outside and said, “Look at what these [Jews], who were showing themselves as decent people, were occupied with.”

But I say, because I saw elsewhere that Scripture calls the Philistines כְּרֵתִים (Zeph. 2:5): “Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of (כְּרֵתִים),” and it does not give any other nation this appellation, it appears to me that there is a region of Philistia called Chereth, and so I find in the Book of (I) Samuel (30:14), concerning the group that set fire to Ziklag: “We made a raid on the south of the Cherethites.”

In the language of the Mishnah (B. B. 91a) קְבַרְנִיט, and in French gouvernail, rudder.
<b>they made of ivory inlaid in cypresses</b> [Heb. שֵּׁן בַּת-אֵשֻּׁרִים.] It is impossible for it to be of anything but wood, and this is בּתאשּׁרים, as if it were one word, an expression of (Isa 41: 19): “firs and cypresses (וּתְאַשּׁוּר).” Both of them, Jonathan rendered אֶשּׁכְּרוֹעִן. He compares the rudder of Tyre to a rudder of cypress inlaid with ivory [and] with nails for beauty and strength, for so did Jonathan render: boards of cypresses inlaid with ivory, בֵּיתחוֹפָאָה לְאִתְיָטְרוּן, so that its cover should not fall. However, Jonathan explained this rudder as applying to the city, concerning the boards of its gates.

<b>with wheat of Minnith</b> the name of a place that produced wheat of high quality, like (Jud. 11: 33): “until you come to Minnith.” Midrash Aggadah (source unknown) [explains it as] good, thick wheat kernels, which are sold by number. Jonathan renders: בִּחִטֵי רִיחוּשּׁ expression for a gathering of many numbers, troche in Old French, bundle, bunch. A similar word appears in Pesikta [d’Rav Kahana, p. 184b]: “Just as the myrtle is crowded (רָחוּשּׁ) with leaves, so was Leah crowded with sons.” But I do not know what it [wheat of Minnith] is. In the name of Rabbi Simon, I heard that he found in a Bible with a Jerusalem Targum בְּחִטֵי מִנִיתוּפַנַג rendered: בְּחוּשְּׁלָא וְקֲלְמָא. Now, שַּׁעֲרֵי דְחוּשְּׁלָא, which is found in the Talmud (Yoma 79a), is explained as: peeled barley. I say, however, that “Minnith” is an expression of portions (מָנוֹת), prepared food. Even according to its vocalization with a “dagesh,” Jonathan is wont to translate a word sometimes according to its apparent meaning and sometimes according to its midrashic meaning. So did he render (below 39:16): “And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah (הֲמוֹנָה).” Although we punctuate the name הֲמוֹנָה without a “mappiq hey” (הֱמוֹנָה), [with a “mappiq hey” (pronounced) הֲמוֹנָה would mean “her multitude” with a silent “hey” it means simply “a multitude.”] Jonathan paraphrases: And also there, the slain of the city whose multitude is great will be cast.
<b>balsam trees</b> [Heb. פַנַג.] I saw in the book of Joseph the priest (Josiphon vol. 1 p.155 ch. 36 Flusser): The balsam tree is “pannag,” and they were found in Jericho, and because of the fragrant scent, it [the city] is called Jericho [יְרִיחוֹ from רֵיחַ, scent], balsme in Old French.

<b>and white wool</b> [Heb. צָחֹר.] [Jonathan renders:] “fine white covered wool.” On the day the lamb is born, and its mother cleanses it by licking it, they make a cover and wrap it around it with clasps so that that its wool be clean. צָחֹר means white, like (Jud. 5:10): “white (צִרוֹרוֹת) donkeys.

They are covered with leather and decorated for beauty with sorts of nails forming rows and pictures, and they are called קַמְטְרַיָא in Aramaic and בְּרוֹמִים in Hebrew, and they are tied and bound with linen ropes for beauty.
<b>and [enclosed in] myrtle wood</b> Jonathan renders: myrtle wood. Those chests were placed in chests of myrtle wood, and they would bring them into the outer chests and the chest within them, and so too, the ornaments that were inside the chests; everything all together for merchandising. This is the meaning of the wording in brief: and with treasures [kept] in chests, tied with ropes and [enclosed in] cedar wood, for the בְּרוֹמִים are the chests, and they were tied with ropes and placed in chests of myrtle, which is a species of cedar. And the adornments that were inside the chests, Jonathan calls וְכוּשּׁפִּין דְאַרְזָא בְּאִימְלִין דִּי זָהְרָיִתָא adornments that require good watching (זְהִירוּת), [i.e.,] דְמֲחֲתִין בְּקוֹמְטְרִין that were placed in chests.

<b>Ships...your plains</b> [Heb. שָּׁרוֹתַיִךּ.] They were to you as a plain and a flat terrain.

<b>Behold, are you wiser than Daniel</b> [As for] Daniel Nebuchadnezzar came to make him a god (Dan. 2:46): “and prostrated himself before Daniel, and ordered that they should offer a meal offering and sacrifices of sweet odors to him,” but he did not accept it upon himself, yet you make yourself a God?
<b>that no secret is hidden from you</b> [Heb. לֹא עֲמָמוּךָ,] is not hidden from you. These are taunts [by] which he is taunting; that is to say: Perhaps you are as wise as Daniel, about whom it is stated: (Dan. 4: 6): “and no secret overwhelms you?”

@7
<b>and they will draw their swords</b> [This is to be understood] according to its apparent meaning. [According to] Midrash Aggadah (see Mechilta to Exod. 15:9; Tan. Va’era 9), it means homosexuality, for he was used sexually as women are. Three pretended to be gods and were sexually molested like women: Joash the son of Ahaziah, as it is said (II Chron. 24:24): “and upon Joash they exacted judgment,” Hiram, and Nebuchadnezzar.
<b>your brightness</b> [Heb. יִפְעָתֶךָ,] your brightness, an expression of the appearance of the countenance. The Medrash interprets it as “the beauty of your time (יְפֵה עִתֶּךָ) .”

<b>In Eden, the garden of God</b> With much goodness and pleasure. You enjoy yourself as if you were dwelling in Eden, the garden of God. All wealth, pride, and honor are given to you: all precious stones are set on your raiment.
<b>your covering</b> Your canopy. Another explanation: Your raiment.
<b>the work of your drums and your orifices</b> Although I gave you all this honor, I knew that you would become haughty, and I made in you the work of the perforated drums that let out wind with an instrumental sound like a drum, and these are what you should have contemplated about.
@14
<b>You are a cherub of great measure, that covers</b> You are a bird of measure, i.e., the huge bird that covers a large area with his wings; i.e., you rule over a large dominion. מִמְשַּׁח is a word for largeness, like (Num. 13:32): “men of stature (אַנְשֵּׁי מִדוֹת).” which is translated into Aramaic as גַבְרֵי דְמִשְּׂחָן.

<b>from among the stones of fire</b> that you shall not take a share with the righteous. Our Rabbis in the Midrash Aggadah (B. B. 75a) interpreted this section as referring to Adam: So said the prophet to Hiram, “Why should you be proud of your sky? Were you in the Garden of Eden, as Adam was?
<b>[13] every precious stone, etc.</b> For I made all these canopies for Adam, and the least of them was gold, which is counted last.

@19

@23
<b>and they will judge themselves as slain in her midst by the sword [coming] upon her from all around</b> Because they will see the sword surrounding [them] from outside, the people of the city will assess [the situation] and be sure that they will be slain in her midst. [Heb. וְנִפְלַל,] like (Gen. 48:11): “I did not think (פִלָּלְתִּי),” and like (Deut. 32:31): “and our enemies judge (פְּלִילִים).” They will judge themselves to be slain in her midst.
@24
<b>And there will no longer be to the house of Israel, etc.</b> Since he prophesied about Ammon, Moab, the Philistines, Edom, Tyre, and Zidon, who are the neighbors of the land of Israel, that they would be destroyed. Since they all will be destroyed, there will not be a briar or a thorn to [the people of Israel, in all their surroundings, to pain or harm them.
<b>briars</b> [Heb. סִילוֹן,] a species of thistles and thorns.
<b>pricking</b> [Heb. מַמְאִיר,] a matter of hurting, like (Lev. 13:51): “painful (מַמְאֶרֶת) zaarath,” poignante in French, stinging, pricking.

<b>the great crocodile</b> Since all the greatness of Egypt and all its plenty comes though the Nile River, the prophet compares its king to a crocodile and its people to the fish of the river.

<b>the fish of your rivers to fasten onto your scales</b> [Heb. בְּקַשְּׂקְשּׂתֶיךָ,] en tes e(s)chardes in Old French, to your scales. That is to say, I shall inspire all your mighty men to go forth with you to war so that they will all fall.
@5
<b>And I will scatter you in the desert</b> [Heb. וּנְטַשְּׁתִּיךָ,] e etandre toy in Old French, and I shall spread you out. This is the perishing of fish: once they are spread out on the surface of the dry land, they die.
@6
<b>a prop of reeds</b> Many times they relied on them: in the days of Sennacherib and in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, but it did not avail them, just like this reed, which is soft and does not support the one who leans on it.
@7
<b>When they took hold of you with the hand</b> [Heb. בְּכַפְּךָ, lit. with your hand,] to be read בַּכַּף, with the hand, like a man who walks and supports himself on his staff.
<b>you splintered</b> [Heb. תֵּרוֹף] [like] תֵּרָצֵף.
<b>and pierced the whole of their shoulders</b> [lit. the whole of a shoulder,] i.e., their shoulders, like a man who leans on a reed, which breaks, and the man falls on it, and the shreds enter his shoulders.
<b>and you made their loins stand upright</b> [Heb. וְהַעֲמַדְתָּ.] Since you will break, they will be required to strengthen their loins and stand on them. You are like a man upon whom his friend was leaning, but he is weak and he says to him, “Strengthen yourself on your loins, for you can no longer lean on me.” So did Jonathan render: “and you will no longer be a support for them.” Some transpose וְהַעֲמַדְתָּ to וְהַמְעַדְתָּ, and you make all loins totter, but I do not care for their words. Moreover, Menachem (p. 134) associated it with the standing of the feet, just as I do.
@11
<b>neither shall it be inhabited for forty years</b> Forty-two years of famine were decreed in Pharaoh’s dream, corresponding to the three times the dream is written. He saw seven bad cows and seven bad ears of grain (Gen. 41) and he told it to Joseph; hence we have [it mentioned] twice, and Joseph said to him, “The seven thin and bad cows and the seven empty ears,” totaling forty-two for the famine. But they had only two, as it is stated (ibid. 45:6): “For it is two years now that the famine has been on earth,” and when Jacob came down to Egypt, the famine ceased, for behold in the third year they sowed, as it is stated (ibid. 47:19): “and then you give us seed that we may live etc.,” and the forty years were paid to them now: “neither shall it be inhabited for forty years.” תֵּשֵּׁב means sera asijiee in Old French. will be settled, peopled.
@14
<b>their habitation</b> [Heb. מְכוּרָתָם] [like] מְגוּרָתָם, their habitation. Another interpretation: like תוֹלדוֹתָם, their birth, and this is how Menachem (p. 110) associated it.
@15
<b>So that they shall not domineer over the nations</b> [Heb. רְדוֹת,] an expression of ruling, like (Gen. 1:28): “and rule (וּרְדוּ) over the fish of the sea.”
@16
<b>And it will no longer be</b> [i.e.,] Egypt [will no longer be] a source of confidence for the House of Israel, bringing iniquity into remembrance for them, since the Holy One, blessed be he, said to them (Exod. 14:13): “You shall no longer continue to see them.”
@17
<b>And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year</b> of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. That year Egypt was delivered into his hand. This is what we learned in Seder Olam (ch. 26). In this book, there are many prophecies written in a non chronological order.
@18
<b>made his army serve [a great work against Tyre]</b> [Heb. צוּר אֵל, usually to here means] against Tyre, [in] a great work.
<b>every head</b> the men of his forces
<b>became bald and every shoulder, etc.</b> As is the custom with those who besiege a city many days and toil and weary themselves with carrying burdens of wood and stones. He captured Tyre in the twenty third [year] of his reign, as we find in Seder Olam (ad loc.). מֻקְרָח means calvo in Italian, bald.
<b>sore</b> [Heb. מְרוּטָה,] pelee in Old French, peeled.
<b>yet he had no reward</b> After they had plundered its booty, the sea rose and washed it away from them, because it was decreed on it and on its booty to be lost in the sea.
@20
<b>For his labor that he undertook against it</b> [As] reward for the labor that he undertook against Tyre by My command, I shall give him the land of Egypt.
<b>because of what they did to Me</b> [Because of] the evil that Egypt [did to Me] with their prop, that they assured My people with their futile aid.
@21
<b>On that day will I cause the horn of the House of Israel to blossom out</b> I have neither heard nor found the explanation of this verse. What is the blossoming of the horn of Israel in the downfall of Egypt? Was not Israel exiled eight years before the downfall of Egypt? [Therefore,] I say that “On that day” refers back to the above section, (verse 13): “At the end of forty years, I will gather the Egyptians.” That count ends in the year that Belshazzar assumed the throne, and we find in Daniel that in that year the kings of Persia began to gain strength, and downfall was decreed upon Babylon, as it is said (Dan. 7:1): “In the first year of Belshazzar,...Daniel saw a dream, etc.”; (verse 4) “The first one was like a lion” - that is Babylon. And it is written (ad loc.): “I saw until its wings were plucked off, etc. (verse 5) And behold another, second beast, resembling a bear” that is Persia. And it is written (ad loc.) “And thus it was said to it, ‘Devour much flesh.’” i.e., seize the kingdom. And the kingdom of Persia was the blossoming of the horn of Israel, as it is said regarding Cyrus (Isa. 45:13): “He shall build My city and free My exiles.” Now, how do we know that the forty years of Egypt ended at that time? [The proof is that] Egypt was given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the twenty-seventh [year] of Nebuchadnezzar, in the year that this prophecy was said to Ezekiel. Add forty years, and you have sixty-seven. Deduct from them forty-five for Nebuchadnezzar and twenty-three for Evil- Merodach, as we say in Megillah (11b), one of these years counting for both [kings], as we say there: “they were incomplete years.”
<b>and I will give you free speech in their midst</b> You, Ezekiel, will have free speech when they see your prophecy being fulfilled.

<b>I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt</b> already another time, for I placed his army in the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as it is said in the Book of Jeremiah (46:2): “Concerning Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco, the king of Egypt, which was on the Euphrates in Carcemish, whom Nebuchadnezzar king smote, etc.”
<b>and behold, it was not bound</b> from that day on, as it is said at the end of the Book of Kings (II 24:7): “And the king of Egypt no longer went out of his land, for the king of Babylonia had taken from the river of Egypt,” and with this expression Jeremiah, too, prophesied concerning that blow, using the language “it has no cure,” as it is said (Jer. 46:11): “Go up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt; in vain you have increased medicines, you have no cure.” חֻבָּשָּׁה is an expression of binding, for they bind the broken bone. to place a bandage [Heb. חִתּוּל,] [a dressing] made of cloth and plaster, like (above 16: 44): “nor swaddled at all (והֳחְתֵּל לֹא חֻתָּלְתְּ).”

The Midrash Aggadah (Pesikta Rabbathi 34:11, Meir Ayin 33) [states]: “and among the interwoven branches was its lofty top.” Whence did he merit greatness? Because 1) he withdrew from the counsel of the generation of separation, as it is said (Gen. 10: 11): “Out of that land Asshur went forth. “When all those who came upon the world formed one league to enter counsel to rebel against Him, then his lofty top was visible by itself, and [he] did not link himself with them. “Water nurtured him; the [waters of the] deep raised him up” and because 2) he hearkened to the voice of Jonah the son of Amittai, who descended into the [waters of the] deep, and the people of Nineveh repented of the violence that was in their hands.

<b>and you went out with your rivers</b> [Heb. וַתָּגַח,] and you went out with your rivers, the same meaning as in (Ps. 22:10): “You drew me (גֹחִי) from the womb”; (Job 40:23), “he will draw (יָגִיחַ) the Jordan into his mouth”; Jud. 20:33), “And the liers in wait of Israel drew forth (מֵגִיחַ).” [This is] an expression for something flowing and going out of a hidden place.

Therefore, they will pass by them and bury them. Menachem (p. 91) interprets it in his book (Machbereth) to mean that they will close their nose so as not to smell the odor of the corpses.

@5
<b>And behold a wall outside the House</b> He showed me the structure of one building on the north side of the mountain and a wall on the outside going all around. It is delineated as such at the end of the Book that the city is in the south and the House in the north.
<b>six cubits by a cubit and a handbreadth</b> “Six cubits of a cubit that is a cubit and a handbreadth.” So did Jonathan render it. This is a cubit of medium length which equals a cubit and a handbreadth using a cubit that equals five handbreadths.
<b>the width of the structure</b> the thickness of the wall.
<b>and the height one rod</b> And this was the outside wall, which surrounds the Temple Mount, and it was low, as we learned (in Middoth 2:4): All the walls that were there were high except for the eastern wall, for the priest who would burn the [Red] Cow would stand on the Mount of Olives [and would look directly at the entrance to the Temple proper at the time of the sprinkling of the blood].
@6
<b>And he came to the gate that faced eastward</b> he entered the enclosure and came to the eastern gate of the Women’s Court, which is called “the Outside Court” throughout this entire account, since it is in front of the Israelites’ Court.
<b>and he ascended its steps</b> For the incline of the mountain ascends gradually from the lower “hel” (an expanse and steps) up to the Women’s Court, twelve steps, in accordance with the Mishnah that we learned (Middoth 2:3): On its inner side, [i.e., on the inner side of the fence] was the “hel” of ten cubits’ [width], and twelve steps were there, etc.
<b>the post of the gate</b> This is the doorpost of the gate.
<b>one rod the width</b> six cubits. It overlay the entire thickness of the wall, which was one rod, as stated above (verse 5).
<b>and the other post</b> The second sidepost; one was in the north and one was in the south.
@7
<b>And the cell</b> This was a projecting gallery, called appentis in French (see I Kings 6:5). There were three on the right of the gate and three on the left, as is stated in this section. The cells were near the eastern wall of the Women’s Court, on the outside, facing the Temple Mount. Now, from where do I learn that they were on the outside? From what is written after this entire account (verse 17): “And he brought me to the outer Court.” From here I learn that all that had been spoken of previously was outside it, for he had not yet entered it.
<b>And the cell was one rod in length, etc.</b> The inner area of each one was six cubits square.
<b>and between the cells five cubits</b> The walls separating the cells were five cubits thick, and so did Jonathan render: and between the cells was a wall of five cubits, and so we learned in Tractate Middoth (4:7): The wall of the cell was five [cubits.]
<b>and the post of the gate that was beside the hall of the gate, etc.</b> [i.e.,] [extending] beyond the gate was a hall connected to the gate, as is delineated in this account, protruding ten cubits into the Women’s Court, and at its front end were doors and posts, and this is what he meant by saying: “and the post of the gate” which was “next to the hall of the gate.”
<b>from inside</b> [Heb. מֵהַבָּיִת i.e.,] toward the inside. The width of one rod covered the thickness of the wall of the hall, one on the right, [wall] and one on the left, for the thickness of [each] wall of the hall - to the [hallway’s] right and to [its] left - was one rod, as he explains further.
@8
<b>And he measured the hall of the gate from inside</b> inward of the gate.
<b>one rod</b> The thickness of the right and left walls upon which the hall was founded.
@9
<b>And he measured the hall of the gate eight cubits</b> the length of its protrusion into the Women’s Court.
<b>and its pillars</b> Meselins in Old French, posts, pillars. All the pillars mentioned in this account were sort of round trees made of hewn stone, standing in the entrance, one to the right and one to the left, in place of posts, in place of doorposts, and so did Jonathan render (Isa. 1:4): “And the doorposts (אַמוֹתהַסִפִּים) quaked”: אֵילְמַתסִפּיָא. And they are called אֵילִים because they were round like the terebinth and like the oak (וְכָאַלוֹן כָאֵלָה).
<b>and its pillars two cubits</b> in diameter. They were standing at the end of the hall space, this one attached to the right wall and this one to the left wall. The result is that the [total] protrusion of the hall and its pillars was ten cubits beyond the gate, into the Court interior.
<b>and the hall of the gate from inside</b> Since the hall of the Israelites’ Court Gate protruded and extended outward, as is delineated in this account, he explains concerning the hall of the Women’s Court Gate that it [in contrast] extended inward. The Women’s Court Gates were built in a straight line with the gates of the Israelites’ Court, resulting in one hall facing another hall, which is a beautiful thing.
@10
<b>And the cells of the gate</b> [i.e., of] this [gate] that faced eastward - which was in the eastern wall of the Women’s Court - three were from here and three were from here: three to the south and three to the north, next to the wall of the Women’s Court, and facing the Temple Mount. The measurements of each cell’s interior and the wall that intervened between one and another were explained above.
<b>and one measure for the pillars</b> made for the hall’s posts on the inside.
<b>from here and from here</b> of the right and of the left; their measurement was two cubits.
@11
<b>the width of the entrance of the gate</b> The width of the span of the entrance, and so we learned (Mid. 2:3): All the entrances...were ten cubits wide.
<b>the length of the gate</b> This is the span of the hall of the gate from north to south.
<b>thirteen cubits</b> ten corresponding to the span of the entrance plus a cubit and a half on this side and a cubit and a half on the other side. Now, do not wonder why in respect to the entrance he calls it width and in respect to the span of the hall he calls it length, because in respect to the entrance, its height and its length and the width is from post to post, but the hall, since the extension of the protrusion of its east to west span is less than the measure of its north to south span, as this is eight cubits and that is thirteen, he calls the larger measure “length.” And here is evidence for the matter: in the Temple of [the Book of] Kings (I 6:3): “And the hall before the Temple of the House, twenty cubits [was] the length thereof, beyond the breadth of the House.” We thus find that north-to-south is called breadth as regards the Temple, yet, as regards the hall, it is called length, because the east-to-west measurement of the Temple exceeded [its measurement] from north to south, and with the hall, it was the opposite. [Hence,] you learn that the large measurement is [always] called length.
@12
<b>And a border [area] was before the cells of one cubit, etc.</b> The cells on either side of the gate were inset [away] from being in line with the area of the inward-going hall, a cubit to the north and a cubit to the south. For he already made it clear that on the inside, it [the space] was extended beyond from the [the area] facing the space of the gate, a cubit and a half to the north and likewise to the south. Now he explains that the cells which were on the outside were recessed to the north, one cubit more than the hall, and likewise one cubit to the south. As a result, they were recessed from the area of the [gate’s] entrance’s width, two and a half cubits to this side and two and a half cubits to this side. This is [the meaning of] the word וּגְבוּל, somayl in Old French, border, limit, an empty place. The wall of the cell was five cubits thick, resulting in the thickness of the northern wall of the northern cell, a nd the thickness of the northern wall of the hall, ending opposite each other. For the wall of the hall was six cubits thick and the wall of the cell was five, and it was extended one cubit inward opposite the thickness of the wall of the hall, and likewise, to the south.
@13
<b>And he measured the gate from the roof of the cell to its [other] roof</b> from the roof of the cell at the north of the gate to the roof of the cell at the south of the gate.
<b>twenty-five cubits</b> The thickness of the wall of the cell was five [cubits], as was the thickness of the wall of the cell that was on the second side, totaling ten [cubits]; and the two and a half cubits that it (some versions: the cell) was recessed from the space of the entrance to this side and likewise to that side, totaled fifteen; and the space of the entrance was ten cubits, making twenty-five. And all of these, which together make up the measurement of the width of the gate, corresponded to the thirteen cubits of the space of the inward going hall, plus the two walls, one rod from this side and one rod from that side, totaling twenty-five [cubits].
<b>an entrance opposite an entrance</b> The entrance of the cell that was next to the gate in the south was directed exactly opposite the entrance of the cell that was next to the gate in the north, for the six cells did not have an entrance in the outside wall, but the two cells nearest the gate had entrances facing the space between the two of them, and so he says below (verse 16): “and for their doorposts [facing] toward the ‘inward of the gate.’” This teaches us that their entrances faced the gate.
@14
<b>And he made the pillars sixty cubits</b> The height of the pillars of the posts of the hall was sixty cubits.
<b>and [likewise] to the pillars of the court [and of] the gates all around</b> And the same was for all the pillars that were in all the halls of the gates all around. For also in the north and in the south the gates were constructed like this gate, as is delineated in this account.
@15
<b>And the height of the entrance gate</b> [Heb. וְעַל פְּנֵי הַשַּׁעַר,] lit. and on the face of the gate. The height of this gate. It is called שַּׁעַר הָאִיתוֹן because it serves as an entrance and exit for all who come into the Temple court. [The word] איתון is Aramaic for בִּיאָה, entry.
<b>together with the height of the inner ball of the gate</b> together with the height of the hall of the gate, which is further in than the gate.
<b>fifty cubits</b> And from the height of the other gates [mentioned] in this account, which were fifty cubits, I learn that the עַל פְּנֵי stated here means the height. (i.e., the outer gate’s height was fifty cubits, “together with the height of the entire hall:” just like the inner gate of the hall. For also at the end of the hall is a[nother] gate, as was already made clear in verse 7.).
@16
<b>And narrowing windows [were made] for the cells</b> These cells did not have doors facing the outside, but one open to the other; and so we find in Tractate Middoth (4:3) regarding the cells around the Temple: “Each one had three entrances, one to the cell on the right, one to the cell on the left, and one to the cell above.” But as for the cells in the Court which were only three cells, one beside the other, having no cells above them the middle ones had two entrances: one to the cell on the right and one to the cell on the left; and the outer one, [standing] at the side of the gate, had two entrances: one open to the middle one and one to the side of the gate, and it was likewise with the outer cell of the other second side, on both sides of the gate, as is written above (verse 13): “an entrance opposite an entrance.” Now these [cells] had windows “שְּׁקֻפִים אֲטֻמִים both open and shut” - [I Kings 6:4] - open to the outside and “shut” to the inside, meaning narrow on the inside and wide on the outside to the east. Menahem (p. 180) interpreted שְּׁקֻפִים as being related to the word for looking (הַשְּׁקָפָה), as in (Song 6: 10) “Who is this who looks forth (הַנִשְּׁקָפָה)”; (Ps. 102:20) “For He has looked down (הִשְּׁקִיף) from His holy height.” He interprets [the word “lintel” in] (Exod. 12:22) “to the lintel (אֶל הַמַשְּׁקוֹף)” also, as being related to the word for [over]looking.
<b>and for their doorposts [facing] toward the “inward of the gate”</b> [i.e.], and to the edges of the entrances of the two cells nearest the gate on this side and that side. For their entrances were [facing] towards the inner area of the gate: the entrance of the northern cell on the north of the gate, and the entrance of the southern cell on the south of the gate. The edges of the entrances on each side of the entrance of the cell are the “posts.” And they had windows open to the intervening space - having the width of the gate - which intervened between the cells. Now, he calls that space “inward of the gate,” for when someone enters the area between the protrusions of the cells of here and there, it appears as though he has entered the gate.
<b>and likewise for the halls</b> And so did the halls of every gate have windows.
<b>and windows all around [facing] inward</b> in the wall, on the Court’s side, on the inside.
<b>and to the posts were palm like crowns</b> Jonathan renders: כּוֹתַרְתָּא, crowns at the top of the pillar. They were made like crowns, [each] resembling a palm tree, for in [the account about] Solomon’s Temple (I Kings 6:29) they are translated by the Targum, צוּרַתדִּקְלִין (shapes of palm trees), pomels, crowns.
@17
<b>and a balcony</b> [Heb. וְרִצְפָּה,] planchez in Old French, flooring, paving: and I say that it was a surrounding balcony, like the one of which we learned (Middoth 2:5): “Originally it had been quite bare, but they surrounded it with a balcony” and on that balcony were the chambers, chanbres in Old French. And from that which is stated in this account “And the balcony was to the side of the gates,” and its base was on line with the height of the gates - we learn that this flooring was a balcony.
@18
<b>And the balcony was to the side of the gates</b> The top of the gates of the Court separated the balcony, so that it did not go around the entire Court, and [thus the balcony] was to the sides of the gate from this side and from that side, parallel to the top of the gates.
<b>the base of the balcony</b> [Heb. הַתַּחְתּוֹנָה.] This word is different from every תַּחְתּוֹנָה in the Scriptures, for everywhere the accent is on the “nun,” whereas here, it is on the “tav” [so that the word is essentially תַּחְתּוֹן]. We learn that this תַּחְתּוֹנָה was not a balcony that is under another one but was one balcony, and the base of this balcony paralleled the top of the gate. The “hey” of תַּחְתּוֹנָה is like the “hey” of בֵּיתָה and like the “hey” of עֶזְרָתָה, and of חֶלְאָתָה, each of which is superfluous.

For the cells were inside, in the Inner Court, for the hall of the gate protruded into the outer [court], as is included in the account, and it is impossible for [both] the cells and the hall to have been facing the same area so that the entrances of the cells [too] could have opened to the inside of the hall, for the account equates all the measurements of the outer gates with those of the inner ones, and it distinguishes between them only as regards the protrusion of the halls.] (For the cells were outside, and six cells and their walls and the fifteen cubits of the width of the gate total eighty-one cubits, whereas the entire Inner Court is only one hundred by one hundred, as is specified in the account. Absent in other editions).

<b>and he measured the pillars of the hall</b> [Heb. אֵל אֻלָם,] like אֶל אֻלָם, the pillars of the hall; the thickness of the sides of the entrance (that look toward the east absent in some editions) he measured from east to west. (And I, the copyist, found in other commentaries as I copied.)
<b>and the width of the gate, three cubits from here, etc.</b> That was the width of the northern pillar [going] into the hall space to the west. So too was the thickness of the southern pillar which went inside the Hall on the west. And although we learned that (Mid. 4:7): “The wall of the Hall was five [cubits] and the Hall was eleven,” that of the future Temple will only be three, but in the Hall of the Second Temple etc. - absent in some editions.)
<b>five cubits</b> That of the Second Temple was the same, for so we learned (Mid. 4:7): “The wall of the Hall was five [cubits] and the Hall was eleven [cubits],” except that there were no [front wall] sides to the entrance on the north and south in the Hall of the Second Temple. The width of the entrance was twenty cubits, just as the width of the Hall, and here it says, “and the width of the gate: three cubits over here and three cubits over there,” (and I do not know how to reconcile it) except [to say] that the width of the front sides of the entrance was three cubits closing in on the space of the entrance here and three cubits there.

<b>And he came to the interior</b> to the wall that separated the Heichal from the Holy of Holies.
<b>and measured the pillar of the entrance</b> Its thickness was two cubits. This was not equal to the cubit for the partition.

@5
<b>And he measured the wall</b> the western wall.
<b>and the width of the cell</b> [Heb. הַצֵלָע,] apendiz in Old French. The interior of the cell behind it was four amos in measurement, and in the Second Temple it was six (amos). And perforce this Temple is the one of the future, because there was no wall separating the Holy of Holies in the Second Temple.
@6
<b>thirty-three times</b> But in the Second Temple, there were thirty-eight: fifteen in the north, and fifteen in the south - five upon five, and five atop them - and eight in the west. [The term] צֵלָע is synonymous with יָצִיעַ and with תָּא. I say that the cells in the north and the south were arranged as follows: each one was twelve cubits long, totaling sixty cubits for five cells, and five walls of five cubits each, totaling 85. The width of the cleared space was five cubits. Thus you have accounted for ninety cubits of the length of the wall, and so to the south. Those in the west were one on top of another, and a third atop them, and their length across their top was twenty cubits, paralleling the width of the Holy of Holies, making eleven in each row. So did Jonathan render: eleven in a row.
<b>thirty-three times</b> eleven upon eleven, and eleven atop them. So did Jonathan render: eleven in a row, but in the Second Temple etc.... and with תָּא, and no more.)
<b>and they rested upon the inside of the wall</b> The beams of the cells of the top story - their ends on the side toward the cells’ outer wall would rest upon the wall, on its inner side, and puncture it. This is the meaning of “the inside of the wall of the cells” into the side that was toward the interior of the cells; and this is the meaning of “that they might hold therein,” - be fastened securely, po[r]pris in Old French, firmly held.
<b>that they should not be held in the wall of the House</b> Their ends on the side toward the wall of the Heichal rested on, and penetrated the recesses, i.e., the wall of the Heichal protruded into the interior of the cells, as it is stated regarding Solomon’s [Temple] building (I Kings 6:6): “for he made rebatements in [the wall of] the House round about on the outside.” The width of the interior of the nethermost chamber was five cubits, and its upper story was six, for the wall of the Heichal was recessed from above one cubit; therefore the interior of the nethermost one was five cubits wide and the third chamber was seven cubits wide and this was atop the middle one, which had the wall of the Heichal protruding into it one cubit from above and these too were like them. And this is what is meant by “and they would nor be held in the wall of the House”; they did not penetrate into the wall of the Heichal as do ends of other low beams which are fastened onto a high wall, i.e., [builders usually] make holes in the wall and thrust the beams into the holes.
@7
<b>And it became wider</b> And the cells constantly widened as they went upward, as I explained: the middle one was a cubit wider than the lowest one, and the uppermost [one] was a cubit [wider] than the middle one.
<b>and it wound higher and higher</b> [Heb. וְנָסְבָה,] and it was surrounded by a spiral staircase, fiz in Old French. This is a stone structure similar to a pillar, with steps winding around it. It seems to the person who is ascending upon it that he is encircling a stone pillar. In German it is called a wendelstein. This is what is [meant when it is] stated regarding Solomon’s Temple (I Kings 6:8): “and upon winding stairs (לוּלִים) they went up into the middle [chamber].” That too is translated [into Aramaic] as וּבִמְסִיבָתָא, like וְנָסְבָה לְמַעְלָה לְמַעְלָה and it wound higher and higher. The spiral staircase continued to wind higher and higher up to the roof of the uppermost cell, as he proceeds to explain, [so] that the spiral staircase ascended from the nethermost cell to the middle one and from the middle one to the uppermost one.
<b>for the encompassing of the House</b> to the cells.
<b>went upward round about the House: therefore, the widest part of the House was above</b> Therefore, we said, “And it became wider and it wound higher and higher.” The widest part of the House within the cells was above. The uppermost [cell] was wider than all of them.
<b>and so, [from] the nethermost</b> Jonathan rendered: “And so, with the spiral staircase they would ascend from the nethermost to the uppermost through the middle one.” And so they would ascend with the spiral staircase from the nethermost one to the uppermost one by way of the middle one.
@8
<b>And I saw that the House had a height</b> He does not delineate its measurement, but we learn in Tractate Middoth (4:6): “with a height of one hundred cubits.”
<b>the foundations of the cells were the full length of a rod</b> The foundation of the cells was the full length of a rod.
<b>six cubits was its span</b> [Heb. אַצִילָה.] Jonathan renders: span. [The part] of the foundation of the stone wall within the earth was six cubits wide, but [the part] above the earth was five cubits wide, as is delineated in this section in the following verse.
@9
<b>The width of the wall of the cell to the outside</b> The wall of the cells adjoining the Court; i.e., the western wall.
<b>was five cubits</b> And we also learned in Tractate Middoth (4:7), that the wall was five cubits [wide].
<b>and what was left clear</b> And a clear area was left at the northern and southern corners that adjoined the east and the west. For the cells did not encompass the entire House, and the entrances of the cells in the eastern corners led to that cleared area - as is stated in this section: “And the entrance of the cell to the clear space”. The cells had no entrances either to the side of the Court or to the side of the Heichal, but to those in the northeastern [corner] and the southeastern corner, had an the entrance in the wall which opened to the cleared off area. And by that entrance they would enter it, and from it, into the second cell, and from the second into the third, and so on all around, as we learned in Tractate Middoth (4:3): “and an area left over.” Another explanation:
<b>left clear</b> Those on the inside of the cells that were toward the side of the House was left clear; i.e., a clear area was left over between the cells and the House, and in the area were the cells’ entrances, as is delineated in this section: “And the entrance of the cell was toward the clear place,” and its width was five cubits, as [Scripture] says: “and the width of the clear area was five cubits,” as I explained above, [i.e.,] that the cells will not be close to the House at all, and there will be a space of five cubits between them and the House. And so did Jonathan render: and an area left over.
<b>for the structure of cells that belonged to the House</b> Opposite the space of the width of the cells in the corner. The words “round about,” written about the clear area, are not referring to [all] four corners, but mean “here and there,” i.e., south and north: the southeastern and the northeastern corners.
@10
<b>And between the chambers was a width of twenty cubits</b> There were chambers in the Outer Court, at the north and at the south of the Inner Court, near its wall. And there was a space twenty cubits wide between the walls of the chambers and the walls of the cells that were around the House. It was not so in the Second Temple edifice, but [it will be so] in the future edifice.

<b>And the entrance of the cell was toward the clear space</b> And the entrances of the outside cells were open to the left over clear area in the corner, as I explained.
@12
<b>And the structure that was before the fortress, etc.</b> The width of the entire structure on the western side - the width of the House and the thickness of the northern and southern wall, with the northern and southern cells, and the thickness of their walls on the north and on the south - equaled seventy cubits, and so too it was in the Second Temple. And so we learned in Tractate Middoth (4:7) about the western wall: “From north to south - seventy cubits,” and it computes the calculation.
<b>the fortress</b> [Heb. הַגִּזְרָה.] Jonathan renders: the fortress. And I say that the tall House was called [the fortress] and that the low cells that were around it were called “the structure.” Menahem, however, (page. 54) interpreted גִּזְרָה as a chamber.
<b>the side that was toward the west</b>. [Heb. דֶרֶךְ יָם, lit. the way of the (Mediterranean) Sea.] The western side.
<b>the side that was toward the west was seventy cubits wide</b> And the width of the structure on the western side, from north to south, was seventy cubits, and here you have the computation: The northern cell was 4 [cubits], and its walls 10, totaling 14. The clear area between the cell and the House was 5 [cubits], totaling 19. The width of the foundation of the walls was included in the interior of the cell and in the clear place. The wall of the Heichal was 6 [cubits], totaling 25, and its interior was 20 [cubits] wide, totaling 45 [cubits]. The southern wall of the Heichal was 6, adding up to 51, and with the 19 [cubits] of the southern cells, the grand total is 70 [cubits].
<b>and the wall of the structure</b> the walls of the cells.
<b>and it was ninety cubits long</b> The length of the structure of the cells and the clear place was ninety cubits [in] the north and [in] the south, not including the depository of the knives, which is not counted because it protruded outward to the north and to the south, and was not the same shape as the rest of the structure. The House was thirty cubits wider in the front than in the back, as we learned (Middoth 4:7): “The Hall exceeded the Heichal by fifteen cubits in the north and fifteen cubits in the south, and that [longer area] was called the Depository of the Knives, because there they stored the knives.” The length of that structure from east to west was ten cubits. This leaves 90 cubits of length with 70 cubits width, for the entire House was 100 cubits long on both sides, as is delineated in this section and in Tractate Middoth (4:6).
@13
<b>And he measured the House, its length was one hundred cubits</b> the grand total, including the extension of the Depository of the Knives. So we learned in Tractate Middoth [concerning the Second Temple] (4:6): “The Heichal was 100 by 100, with a height of 100 cubits. (4:7) From east to west, the Hall’s wall was 5 cubits and its width, 11; the wall of the Heichal was 6 cubits and its length was 40; the partition was 1 cubit; the Holy of Holies was 20 cubits; the wall of the Heichal was 6 cubits; the cell was 6 cubits; and the wall of the cell was 5 cubits.” Above, in this section, [which concerns the Third Temple] as well, all of their measurements are explained in the same way, except for the [single] cubit for the partition, concerning which it is written in this section (verse 3): “two cubits,” but counterbalancing that, it decreases the width of the cell by a cubit, for the cell in the Mishnah was 6 cubits wide and its wall was 5 [totaling 11 cubits], and here its width is 4 and its wall is 6 [totaling only 10 cubits] as it is written (verse 8): “the foundations of the cells were the full length of a rod,” and though higher up it became narrower and recessed a cubit, as it is written (verse 9): “and the wall of the cell was five cubits.”
<b>and the fortress and the structure and its walls</b> The end of the verse explains its beginning, saying that [it is] the sum total [that] was one hundred cubits.
@14
<b>And the width of the front of the House and the fortress to the east was one hundred cubits</b> The fortress and the cell that was behind it that is הַבְּנִיָה, the “structure” - like בִּנְיָן - and the thickness of the walls, all added up to one hundred cubits. For I explained above that the House was thirty cubits wider in front, for the Hall spread out wider than the Heichal and the cells, fifteen cubits to the north and fifteen cubits to the south. Not that the interior of the Hall was wider than the interior of the Heichal, but that the depository for the knives was attached to the Hall on either side.
@15
<b>And he measured the length of the structure before the fortress, which was behind it</b> [Heb. אֲשֶׁר עַל אַחֲרֶיהָ, lit. that was on its back.] Now he returns and measures the length of the House on the south, as he measured it on the north. (I found:) And that is the meaning of “behind it,” i.e., backwards, for he returned and measured by turning around, turning on his heels, toward the west.
<b>and its corners</b> [Heb. וְאַתִּקֶיהָא, and its extremities.] Jonathan renders: its corners; i.e., with the extended section making up the depository for the knives, which was at the corners of the house.
<b>and the Inner Sanctum and the Halls of the Court</b> The end of this verse is not related to its beginning, but is connected to the following verse, and this is its explanation: And the Heichal as well as the Inner Sanctum - which is the Holy of Holies - as well as the Halls of the Court delineated above -(30: 40) “and the Halls round about” - all these had posts, narrowing windows, and “attikim” surrounding the three of them, including the “gizrah,” which is the Heichal, (the Halls), and the Holy of Holies. The three of them had the “sippim,” posts for their entrances, and the three of them had narrowing windows, and the three of them had “attikim.” I do not know what they are. I say, however, that they are a sort of square column protruding into the wall for reinforcement, they are called piliers in French, pillars.
@16
<b>opposite the posts was a wooden board</b> [Heb. שְּׂחִיף עֵץ.] Jonathan renders: a board of cedar wood.
<b>opposite the posts</b> opposite the posts of the entrance, within the interior space framed by the thickness of the entrance, which was covered with wood (not found in all editions). I found.
<b>round about</b> That is to say: here and there, on both sides of the interior of the entrance.
<b>and from the floor until the windows</b> The base of the wall was made into a wall of cedar wood boards opposite it, and it ascended upward until the windows, and the windows were also covered with it. It is thus found that the windows were also closed from the inside, as it is said (here) (40:16): “And closed windows to the house.” (sic) And all this was [done] on the inside because they would spread upon it a gold plating - for the entire inside was spread over with gold - and gold cannot be spread upon stones.

<b>like [that] appearance</b> Jonathan rendered: “Its appearance was like the appearance of His Glory” - like the appearance of the Throne of Glory that I saw in the Chariot by the River Chebar; I saw a bright light in the Holy of Holies.
@22
<b>The altar was wood</b> Jonathan renders: “Standing for the altar was the table,” i.e., the table is called an altar because nowadays it atones like an altar.
<b>and its corners</b> its legs; and the words “its length,” mentioned in the verse refer to its roof, the main part of the Table.
<b>and its walls</b> its frames.
@23
<b>And...two doors</b> to each entrance, closing one opposite the other, one on the northern doorpost and one on the southern doorpost.
@24
<b>And the doors had two doors each</b> The entrance of the Heichal had two pairs of doors, as we learned in Middoth (4:1): “It had four doors, two on the inner side and two on the outer side... The outside doors opened [swinging] into the entrance space, overlaying the thickness of the wall.” For it [the wall’s depth] was six cubits, and the door was five cubits wide, measuring half the width of the entrance, and was recessed a cubit within the doorpost, with the result that the thickness of the wall had five cubits exposed, and when the outside door was opened toward the inside, it would cover it; and the inner doors would [swing] open toward the interior of the House, covering up [the area of the doorpost] behind the doors, for the entire House was overlaid with gold except [for the area of the doorpost] the doors. Rabbi Yehudah says: Also the inner doors stayed within the entrance, and were in the form of double doors. And they would fold back upon one another. These were two and a half cubits, and these were two and a half cubits, and a half cubit of the doorpost was here and a cubit and a half of the doorpost here, as it is said: ‘And the doors had two doors [each], two turning doors, etc.’ Now this is its explanation: Both the inner doors and the outer doors stood in the area demarcated by the thickness of the wall. These were recessed one half cubit further in along the doorpost. The inner doors would open toward the outer doors, and the outer doors toward the inner doors. How so? Two doors of five cubits each would open one opposite the other along five cubits width of the thickness of the wall. They were composed of leaves, and at their midpoint they would fold back when they were opened, like the wooden tablets upon which [scribes] write using an iron stylus, which fold up one behind the other. The result is that when they were folded, they [each] stood at two and a half cubits, and when they were opened one against the other, they [together] covered five cubits of the thickness of the wall.
@25
<b>and a wooden beam before the Hall</b> [Heb. וְעָב,] tref in Old French. Poles of cedar wood were attached from the wall of the Heichal to the wall of the Hall so that it should not slant down. So we learned in Tractate Middoth (3:8): And a beam projected from the wall of the House and came to the outside facade of the Hall.
@26
<b>to the sides of the Hall</b> The two sides of the entrance.

And the עֻבִּים refer to מְרִישּׁוֹת. Now what are מְרִישּׁוֹת? They are beams. And what are מַלְטַסִים? They are cedar planks placed at the tops of walls, upon which the ends of the beams are lain.

<b>And he took me out</b> of the Inner Court.
<b>to the Outer Court</b> through the Northern Gate mentioned above (40:35): The gate of the Inner Court was opposite the gate to the north, and it was situated in the middle of the length of the Israelites’ Court, which was one hundred cubits.
<b>and he brought me to the chamber that was opposite, etc.</b> To one of the first chambers, or to the place of the chambers, chanbrediz in Old French, block of chambers. These are the chambers standing north of the House, separated twenty cubits from the cells, as is written above (41:10), “And between the chambers was a [space] twenty cubits wide surrounding the House.” Someone [standing in the inner court] would be unable to enter those chambers or the twenty [cubit] wide space between them and the cells except through the Outer Court, as is made clear below in this section. For he states that the Inner Court was one hundred [cubits] by one hundred [cubits] square before the House, to the east; and he states concerning the width of the eastern side of the House: “one hundred cubits.” Ergo, the width of the House blocked off the width of the Inner Court, and one could not enter the Inner [Court if he was starting] from the sides of the chambers of either the north or the south. Therefore, one had to come to those chambers by way of the outer Northern Court.
<b>that was opposite the fortress</b> Those chambers were parallel to the entire one hundred cubit east-to-west length of the House, as is stated in the section concerning [the east-west length of] these chambers (verse 8): “and behold, facing the Temple was one hundred cubits.”
@2
<b>Opposite the hundred cubit length span to the northern entrance</b> [He brought me] to the entrance of the chamber that faced north, towards the Outer Court. And he saw before him a fifty- cubit wide space [extending] until the northern wall of the Outer Court, and the length was one hundred cubits. For the chambers occupy one hundred cubits from east to west, and its width from north to south was fifty cubits, as is stated below in this section, and the interior of the Outer Court was [a total of] one hundred cubits wide, as is stated above (40:23): “and he measured, from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.” We thus find that before the chambers was an empty space one hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.
@3
<b>Opposite the twenty of the Inner Court</b> All this is [meant as] an indication of the location of the chambers [that were] beside the twenty [cubit] wide space of the Inner Court surrounding the House, as it is stated above (41:10): “And between the chambers was a [space] twenty cubits wide.”
<b>and opposite the balcony of the Outer Court</b> For [as] we stated above, the Court was encompassed by a surrounding balcony.
<b>a pillar opposite a pillar</b> [Heb. אַתִּיק,] I do not know what this is.
<b>(Addendum A pillar opposite a pillar</b> An אַתִּיק is a pillar, as Rashi explained [on] (41:15): “and the pillars (וְהָאַתִּיקִים) were around the three of them,” i.e., they surrounded the “upper chambers”, [and he calls them upper ones because they are at the top of the (Temple) Mount, as Rashi explained regarding (verse 9):] “And below these chambers.” And here is a running commentary [of these verses]:
<b>[5] And the uppermost chambers</b> which were at the height of the mountain - two of them were narrow i.e., they were not wide because the pillars would decrease them, for builders reinforce the work on their building by making pillars up to two thirds of the wall [which], from there on, slant to a point. Therefore, the third story was not narrow. This is what Scripture means (verse 6): “For they were three storied, and they did not have pillars”; they did not need to be strengthened as did the lower ones. “And they did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts,” i.e., the pillars of these chambers were not like all other pillars, insofar as other pillars are established beside walls for reinforcement, whereas these were [set] within the thickness of the wall, and protruded outward and inward. Therefore, they consumed part of the building.
<b>[6] Therefore...were deprived</b> Targum renders, דְּחִיקָן, were pressed, since they were in the thickness of the wall, protruding outward and inward, strengthening the chambers.
<b>the lowest and middle stories...of ground space</b> [Heb. מֵהָאָרֶץ, lit. from the ground] Toward the ground. This I found in the name of “a great oak.”)
<b>three-storied</b> [Heb. בַּשְּׁלִשִּׁים,] threefold, implying that those chambers were threefold - three, one over another; and the verses indicate this too, for [Scripture] states (verse 5): “And the uppermost chambers were narrow... more than the lowest stories and the middle stories.” But I could not understand, regarding these three verses, what the meaning of “for the ‘attikim’ consumed” is. What were those “attikim” and how did they consume parts of the upper stories and not any of the lowest and middle stories? And the explanation he gives for the matter, viz. that “they had no pillars” - I do not know how to understand it. (And I had no teacher or aid concerning this entire edifice; only as they showed me from heaven.)
@4
<b>And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits width to the innermost one, a pathway of one cubit</b> It appears to me that since the interior of [each side of] the Outer [Court] was one hundred [cubits] wide from north to south, and of these, the chambers were [occupying a] fifty [cubit] width, and before them was a fifty [cubit] space on the north - here is [already accounted for] the entire width of the Court. It is thus found that the entire width of the [Inner] Court was blocked off, i.e., there was no space between the chambers and the extremity of the depository for the knives, and there was no passageway through which to enter the twenty [cubit] space between the chambers and the cells; The twenty cubit space that intervened between the cells and the chambers consisted of the fifteen cubits that were behind the depository for the knives, and five cubits in addition to them. Now if you ask, “If so, there is a space of five cubits between the corner of [the depository for] the knives and the corner of the chambers?” [I will answer that] the thickness of the wall that intervenes between the Inner Court and the Outer Court blocks him from east to west. For its thickness is six cubits, and its end terminates at the corner [formed by] the end of the one hundred [cubit] length of the Inner Court [meeting] with the corner of the depository of the knives. Therefore, there can be no passageway to that space of twenty [cubits], either in the Inner [Court] or in the Outer [Court] unless there would be a diagonal entrance [inserted] - where the end of the wall between the two courts terminates - in the thickness of the wall, a cubit [wide], enough for a man to enter. One would enter into the five cubit space that is between the [the depository for] the knives and the wall of the Chamber, and [then] walk through that space, toward the west, ten cubits. There, the extension of the depository for the knives terminates, and one enters the twenty [cubits] wide space. This is the meaning of what it says, “a walk of ten cubits width [going] to the innermost one, a way of one cubit.” For he enters it by way of an entrance of one cubit, which [starts to] enter diagonally at the end of the wall. Now why does he call it “a walk of...width”? Should he not say, “a walk of ten cubits length”? Because regarding the housing for the knives, it refers to the width, since the housing for the knives is fifteen cubits from north to south and only ten cubits from east to west.
<b>and their entrances were to the north</b> And the entrances of these chambers were to the north. I found [the following]: And this is the meaning of the northern entrance written above. There he stated it briefly, and here is its explanation.

<b>And the outer wall, etc.</b> that intervenes between the chambers and the Outer Court of the eastern side.

<b>For the length of the chambers</b> from north to south, was fifty cubits.
<b>and behold, before the Temple</b> from east to west, paralleling the Hall and the Temple and House of the Ark Cover, [i.e., the Holy of Holies] and the cells, were one hundred cubits.
@9
<b>And below these chambers</b> I do not know whether this comes to teach that they had tunnels beneath them, or whether it comes to teach that there were chambers in the east of the Court, and [that] since the mountain slopes [downward] to the east, he calls it “and below these chambers.” And he is saying this: And at the lowest point of the Court, to the approach that was on the east as one comes to them from the outer Court.
@10
<b>Along the width of the wall of the Court, etc.</b> One who comes from the east of the Outer Court and veers to the north by way of the outside of the northeastern corner of the Inner [Court’s] walls, to come to those chambers in the north, will find, facing the wall of the [Outer] Court, the eastern wall of the Inner Court, which is west of the Outer [Court] opposite the fortress and the building in the Inner [Court].

@11
<b>And the way before them</b> there was a road before these chambers whose width [was the same as] the space of the Court: fifty cubits. Its appearance was the same as that of the pathway to the chambers that were on the northern side, mentioned above (verse 4).

<b>And as the entrances of the chambers that are toward the way of the south</b> the eastern entrances of the chambers. For in the south, too, there were chambers separated from the southern cells by twenty cubits (as it is written) above (41:10): “And between the chambers was a [space] twenty cubits wide surrounding the House, round about.”
<b>an entrance at the beginning of the pathway</b> The eastern chambers had an entrance at the beginning of the pathway, and the pathway was before the wall of the musicians. Jonathan renders: the platform of the Levites. The expression הַגְּדֶרֶתהֲגִינָה means a stone wall structure made like steps upon which the musicians and the choristers stood.
<b>the way of the east</b> For the platform was in the east, as it is written in (II Chron. 5:12) in the chapter commencing: “was completed”: “And the Levites who sang, all of them - Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, etc., stood east of the altar.”

@15
<b>and he measured it round about</b> the entire outer perimeter of the Temple Mount.
@20
<b>On four sides he measured it</b> Three thousand cubits by three thousand [cubits], for the rod was six cubits long. This is what the Kalir asserted, “The Beloved will stretch out a line of three thousand cubits limited by three thousand cubits.” This is thirty-six times the original dimensions - for the Temple Mount was [originally] five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits; arrange 3,000 times 3,000 as strips of 500 cubits laid vertically and horizontally [forming a solid square], and you will have thirty-six squares of 500 cubits by 500 cubits. [3,000 x 3,000 = 9,000,000. 500 x 500 = 250,000. 9, 000,000 divided by 250,000 = 36.] Therefore, the poet states: “And thirty-six as it was multiplied.”

But [their] sin caused [this not to happen] for their repentance was not suitable, [i.e.,] they did not resolve to stop sinning. [Therefore,] they emerged to freedom [only] through the sanction of Cyrus and his son. Some say that in Babylon they stumbled regarding gentile women.

<b>And these are the measurements of the altar</b> as he explains further (verse 17): “fourteen [cubits in] length by fourteen [cubits in] breadth.”
<b>in cubits; the cubit, one cubit and a handbreadth</b> with a cubit of six [handbreadths], which is a cubit and a handbreadth, [judging] by a cubit of five [handbreadths].
<b>but the base one [ordinary] cubit</b> but its base is measured with an ordinary cubit, which equals five [handbreadths]. The word חֵיק is related to חֵקוּי, permanence, it refers to the one cubit. The cubit is the ordinary cubit, not a cubit and a handbreadth, which is the cubit of six [handbreadths]. So too did we learn in Menahoth (97b) that the base, the circuit, and the horns are measured with a cubit of five [handbreadths].
<b>but the base one [ordinary] cubit</b> This is the yesod.
<b>and such a cubit also for the breadth</b> This is the circuit.
<b>and [likewise on] its border, [going] one span to its edge all around</b> These are the horns, [each of which measured] one span from its center; and they measured a span to each side, totaling a cubit by a cubit.
<b>and equally so the very top of the altar</b> And with this cubit the top of the golden altar was measured [to be] a cubit in length and a cubit in breadth [forming a] square. So it is explained in Erubin (4a). In Menahoth (97b) it is explained more fully in terms of the computation: The base was a cubit in height. It extended upward a cubit, and a cubit was its breadth. The recess of the circuit was recessed a cubit of five [handbreadths], but its height, of which we learned (Middoth 3:1): “It extended upward 5 [cubits] and was recessed a cubit” was not [measured] with a cubit of five [handbreadths].
<b>and [likewise on] its border, [going] one span to its edge</b> The horns, both in their breadth and in their height, were [measured] with a cubit of five [handbreadths].

<b>and the breadth one cubit</b> when one places the second frame upon it. The second frame was thirty by thirty, the result being that it [the bottom, 32 by 32 cubit frame] had a recess around it a cubit wide which was the base. Jonathan renders: עֲזָרָה as מסְתַּמְתָא, a word for floor, [and it was called so] because one would fill the frame with smooth stones, pitch, lime, and molten lead, mix it and pour it out and smooth it out on top, and behold, it would be a kind of floor.
<b>and from the smaller ledge to the greater ledge four cubits</b> From the top of the lower frame until the top of the frame that was upon it was a height of four cubits.
<b>and the breadth, one cubit</b> This is the amount of the recess of the circuit. It went up four cubits and went in one cubit. [In the second Temple, it went up five cubits and went in one.] And this is the “circuit.” The lower one is called smaller because it is only two [cubits] high, whereas the upper one is four.
@15
<b>And the altar hearth</b> The height of the top of the altar, from the circuit and above; and in the [Second] Temple it was only three [cubits]. Jonathan, too, renders: And the altar was four cubits.
@16
<b>And the altar hearth shall be twelve [cubits in] length</b> The [entire] place for the woodpile was twenty-four [cubits] by twenty-four [cubits] and this [section] was twelve by twelve.
<b>to [each of] its four sides</b> [i.e.,] he measured twelve [cubits] from its center to every side. Behold [it was] 24 [cubits] by 24 [cubits]. So is it clear from Zebahim (61b), and so have we learned in Tractate Middoth (3:1): The altar [of the second Temple] was 32 by 32 [cubits]. It extended upward a cubit and receded a cubitforming the baseleaving it 30 by 30 [cubits]. It extended upward five [cubits] and receded a cubitthis is the circuitleaving 28 by 28 [cubits]. The area for the horns was a cubit here and a cubit there, leaving 26 by 26 [cubits]. The area for the priests to walk was a cubit here and a cubit there, leaving 24 by 24 [cubits]the place for the woodpiles.
@17
<b>And the ledge, fourteen [cubits in] length</b> The top of the altar, including the area for the horns and including the area for the feet of the priests, was 28 by 28 [cubits], and the 14 mentioned here were measured from its center, as is explained by “to its four sides.”
<b>and the boundary around it</b> Jonathan renders: and the rim, but our Sages explained it as referring to the horns.
<b>half a cubit</b> He measures from its center; hence it was a cubit by a cubit.
<b>and its base a cubit</b> This is the recession of the base.
<b>and its ascents will look towards the east</b> The ramp upon which they ascended was in the south in order that the one who ascended it would face east, for all the [priests’] turns were made toward the right, and when you place the ramp in the south, the one who ascends it and turns right faces east.

<b>at the end of the House</b> [Heb. בְּמִפְקַד.] Jonathan renders: in a place where he sees the House, i.e., in a holy place. בְּמִפְקַד הַבַּיִת means a place where the House terminates, as in (Num. 32:49): “and not one man of us is terminated (נִפְקַד).” This [bull] is the bull of investiture, [used] in the manner that they [used it] in the Tabernacle, and that bull was burnt and not eaten. And our Sages expounded so in Menahoth (45a): They sacrificed investiture offerings in Ezra’s days just as they sacrificed in Moses’ days.

No one ever entered the one in the south, of which Ezekiel says, “This gate shall be closed.”

<b>by way of the hall of the gate he shall come</b> When he enters the Inner Court in order to enter this small gate to eat therein, he shall enter by way of the hall of the Court’s eastern gate and leave the same way. Now since it states below (46:9), concerning: “But when the people of the land come before the Lord on the Festivals, he who enters by way of, etc.” Scripture commanded making the Court a shortcut since that entry was [made] for the sake of appearing [before God]. He must therefore be well seen [i.e., throughout the entire Court]. It was necessary to specify here concerning visits during the rest of the year that he should not make it a shortcut because this visit is not for the sake of appearing, as is that of the Pilgrimage Festivals. This matter is corroborated many more times in this account.
<b>The prince</b> The High Priest is a prince, and because of his importance he will be permitted to eat the meat and bread of hallowed status in that gate, which is opened for him at the time of his eating.
<b>by way of the hall of the gate he shall come</b> By way of the hall of the Eastern Gate he shall enter the Court and come up to that wicket to eat his bread therein.

Another explanation: The Torah prohibited the priests from wearing woolen raiment because wool causes the body to sweat (not found in some editions).

<b>into the Outer Court, into the Outer Court</b> Since he was speaking of the Heichal and the Inner Sanctum, and he called them the “Inner Court,” and in relation to them, he should call the Israelites’ Court an “Outer Court,” he therefore had to double it twice to say that he is speaking of the Men’s Court, the area that all Israel enter.

<b>you shall measure the length</b> of 25,000 rods and the width of 10,000 rods. Because he did not explain in the first verse what the 25,000 are, whether rods or cubits, he had to say, concerning the 25,000 measures that they were measured with the measuring rod by which the five hundred by five hundred of the Temple Mount were measured.

And from that strip he separated in its center the three strips stated above, which [all together] are twenty- five thousand by twenty-five thousand.

From here we derive that the “maneh” of the Sanctuary was double, and they added a sixth to it in Ezekiel’s time, totaling 240 [zuz] (Men. 77a). When Scripture divided it into three parts and did not write simply, “sixty shekels shall the maneh be for you,” it commanded to make from it a weight one third of it, and a weight equaling a fourth of it, and a weight of the ordinary “maneh” as it was originally. So too did Jonathan paraphrase: a third of the “maneh” shall be twenty “selaim” of silver; a “maneh” of silvertwenty-five “selaim”; a fourth of a “maneh”fifteen “selaim”; altogether, sixty “selaim”; and the great “maneh” of the Sanctuary shall be for you.
@13
<b>a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat</b> This amounts to one out of sixty. Whoever wishes to give little shall not give less than this, and this is what they said (Ter. 4:3): “A stingy person gives one out of sixty.”

@14
<b>And the rule of the oil</b> regarding tithes.
<b>the bath, [which is a measure of] oil, etc.</b> The “bath,” which is a measure of oilthis is its tithe: the “bath” will be from a “kor.” I found [the following]: The tenth that the “bath” represents as a tithe shall be from a “kor.” How so? The tithe of a “bath” is from a “kor.” Dix measures in French, ten measures. This word is used for itself and for others, like (Num. 7:9): “the service of the Sanctuary,” (ibid. 4:33): “the service of [the families of] the sons of Merari.”
<b>ten baths</b> shall equal a “homer” for you. Then it will be possible to take from it one “bath” as a tithe.
<b>for ten baths are a homer</b> because the “homer” will consist of ten “baths” for you. So too did Jonathan render it: one out of ten is the “bath” in relation to the “kor” for ten “baths” are a “kor”.

From here it is derived that “orlah” and “mingled species in the vineyard” are nullified in two hundred [times as much].

<b>and you shall purify</b> [as translated,] and you shall purify.
@20
<b>And so shall you do on seven [days] in the month</b> It may be said that [this means]: And so shall you do all seven, and so too he says above (43:26): “For seven days they shall effect atonement for the altar.” But our Rabbis explained it in Menahoth (45a) in the following manner: And so shall you make [as a sacrifice] a bull that is not to be eaten in [the event of] “seven” tribes who “interpreted the Torah in a new way (שֶּׁחְדֹּשּׁוּ)” and whose tribunal issued a decision that fat is permissible, and seven tribes, (which are the majority of the nation), who acted on their word. They must bring a bull for communal error.
<b>because of mistaken and simple-minded men</b> This is a transposed verse: And you shall expiate the House from mistaken and simple-minded men. After the seven days of investiture, whenceforth the altar will be dedicated, they shall bring their sin-offerings and their guilt-offerings, and they will attain atonement, for at the time that Israel attains atonement, the House attains atonement.

<b>And the prince shall make on that day, etc.</b> Our Rabbis (Hag. 13a) said that they sought to suppress the Book of Ezekiel for his words contradicted the words of the Torah. Indeed, Hananiah the son of Hezekiah the son of Gurion is remembered for good, for he sat in his attic and expounded on it. But because of our iniquities, what he expounded on these sacrificeswhy a bull is brought on the fourteenth day of Nissanhas been lost to us. I say that perhaps he is dealing with the fourteenth of Nissan of the first Passover in which the fully erected House will be dedicated, and this bull will be brought in lieu of the calf born of cattle that Aaron offered up on the eighth of investiture (Lev. 9:2). [Scripture] tells us that if he will not have offered it up on the eighth day of investiture, he should offer it up on the fourteenth of Nissan in order that he should be initiated for the service before the Festival, for it is incumbent upon him [to bring] the sacrifices and the burnt offering of the appointed time, as is stated above (v. 17): “And the burnt offerings and the meal-offerings and the libations on the festivals...shall devolve on the prince, etc.”
@23
<b>seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily</b> But the Torah states (Num. 28:19): “two young bulls, one ram.” We can explain this verse only as meaning seven bulls and seven rams for the seven days, a bull daily and a ram daily, and it comes to teach us that the bulls do not render each other invalid and the rams do not render each other invalid. [I.e., if one bull is missing, the other one may be brought.] So we learned in Menahoth (45a); however, they did not bring proof from this verse but from the verse below (46:6): “But on the New Moon: a young bull from those without blemish, and six lambs and a ram.” But perhaps this too comes to teach the same thing, and this is its meaning: seven bulls and seven rams daily. By adding the sacrifices of each day on its day, they add up to seven bulls for the seven days.
<b>and a sin-offering, a he-goat daily</b> the he-goats of the pilgrimage festivals.
@24
<b>And a meal-offering...an ephah for a bull</b> the meal-offering of the libations, an “ephah” for a bull. Now I do not know what this means, for the Torah stated (28:20): “three tenths for the bull.” It is possible that it means an “ephah” of flour from which we extract a tenth of fine flour from a “se’ah”, for the “ephah” is three “se’ahs”.
<b>and an ephah for a ram</b> This too is flour from which we extract two tenths of fine flour sifted thoroughly, as we learned (Men. 6:6): The two loaves were two tenths from three “se’ahs”. [The requirement of] an “ephah” for the bull teaches that if he did not find fine sifted flour that yielded that much, he may bring from [flour that yields] a tenth to a “se’ah”.
<b>and for each ephah one hin of oil</b> I do not know why. We may say that it does not mean that he must sacrifice the entire “hin,” but that there were notches in the “hin” and he would sacrifice oil according to the fine flour, according to the sacrificial laws for a bull according to its requirement and for a ram according to its requirement, according to the notches of the “hin”.

<b>On the Sabbath day shall be six lambs</b> I do not know why, for the Torah said (Num. 28:9): “two lambs,” and “on the Sabbath Day” means either the Sabbath commemorating the Creation or a festival. I, therefore, say that this Sabbath is not the Sabbath commemorating the Creation, but a festival that requires seven lambs and two rams. Scripture comes and teaches you that [the absence of one] does not render the other one invalid, and if he does not find seven, he should bring six, and if he does not find two rams, he should bring one, as our Rabbis expounded regarding the New Moon.
@5
<b>as he is able to give</b> This teaches that the meal-offerings do not render each other invalid [in each other’s absence].
@6
<b>But on the New Moon: a young bull without blemish</b> Our Rabbis expounded upon this verse in Menahoth (45a): Why does it say, “a young bull”? Since it is stated in the Torah (Num. 28:11): “And at the beginnings of your months, etc., two young bulls,” how do you know that if he did not find two, he should bring one? Because it is stated: “a bull.”
<b>and six lambs</b> Why is it necessary to state this? Since it is said in the Torah, “seven,” how do you know that if he did not find seven, he should bring six? Because it is stated: “and six lambs.” And how do you know [that he should bring] even one? Because the Torah says, “but for the lambs as much as he can afford.”

But on the festivals, concerning which it is stated (Deut. 16:16): “shall all your males appear,” he is required to make it a short-cut like the rest of the people. That is what is written (verse 10): “goes in among them when they go in, and when they go out, they [the prince and people together] go out.”

And he shall not enter by way of the eastern gate as he regularly does on the New Moon and on the Sabbath of Creation, for the eastern gate has no gate opposite it in the west.

<b>And when the prince brings a freewill offering</b> on the six working days.

(Verse 2) “And he shall stand at the doorpost of the gate, and the priests shall offer his burnt offering, etc.”
<b>after he has gone out</b> He does not say here: “but the gate shall not be closed until the evening,” as he says regarding the Sabbath day. For regarding the Sabbath day it says (verse 3): “And the people of the land shall prostrate themselves at the entrance of that gate.” Therefore, it is left open. But on weekdays it is not customary for them to come to prostrate themselves, for everyone is occupied with work; therefore, “after he has gone out, one shall close the gate.”

As soon as he came to the water reaching the loins, he went out upon the bank of the river and measured another thousand before him, a stream that cannot be crossed, and his feet were standing on dry land.

Moses, too, delineated the southern boundary in this way, from the desert of Zin alongside Edom, and he proceeds and counts until (ibid. 34:5): “from Atzmon to the stream of Egypt, and its ends shall be at the sea.” [Accordingly,] נַחֲלָה stated here is like לַנַחַל, to the stream. I found it, however, translated [by Jonathan] as אַחֲסָנָא, an inheritance, and were it not for the fact that the accent is on the last syllable, and [that] the Masorah states that there is no other instance in which the accent is on the first syllable, I would have said that it is an error, and that Jonathan did not translate it that way, only erring readers.

<b>And these are the names of the tribes</b> The arrangement of the portions they divide among themselves; the place of each one.
<b>From the northern end</b> Dan will receive the northern border from Hazer-enan, which is at the eastern corner, until the border of Damascus (in the northwestern corner).
<b>and he shall have the eastern side to the sea</b> i.e., from the eastern side until the sea, Dan [shall have] one portion. Now, he delineated the length but not the width. In the Baraitha of Sifrei in the portion of Ha’azinu (Deut. 32:12), [it says]: “What is the reason for stating, ‘Judah: one portion; Dan: one portion; Asher: one portion?’ It is to teach us that Israel are destined to receive the length, from east to west, measuring 25,000 rods in width, which equal 75 mil.” Now from where did they learn this measurement? From the offering, which is like one of these portions, as is explained above (45:1,6). I found that the following is written: “the length is like one of the portions, and it has a width of 25,000 rods, and a length, from the western side to the eastern side, of twenty-five thousand rods.” [Now, 15, 000 rods] equal 150,000 cubits, for a rod equals six cubits, and every 2,000 cubits equals one mil as we find in Tractate Yoma (67a) regarding the ten sukkot [booths] from Jerusalem to the precipice- behold 150,000 cubits amount to 75 mils. This is what Rabbi Eliezer [Hakalir] established in the liturgical poem, entitled “When I take an appointed time” (the last poem for the second day of Succoth): “At the time of the division of her lands, like a row of a vineyard abroad, in the length from the eastern side to its ends, until the ocean are its commandments, with a width of seventy-five mils are its limits.” (Some editions read: Seventy-five mils to thirteen strips, between the strips of the tribes and the strips of the Sanctuary will amount to 975 mils. Now, according to the figure of 400 parasangs by 400 parasangs for the land of Israel, the mils amount to 1600 [not 975] according to the figuring of the Kalir, who said that four mils equal a parasang. Perhaps the mils of the computation by strips are larger, four of them not fitting into a parasang, and he therefore came to count two and a half mils to a parasang, by which 400 parasangs will equal 1,000 mils. However, the computation of the mils of a strip equal only 975 mils, still leaving the total 25 mils short. The sum of the liturgical poet’s mils of strips does not equal the sum of four hundred parasangs. And whence did Rabbi Eliezer learn that the length of the strips extended to the ocean, which is at the end of the world, whereas Scripture testifies that the western border is [only] until the Great Sea [the Mediterranean], which is quite a distance inland from the ocean?)
@2
<b>And alongside the border of Dan</b> and alongside the border of Dan to its south.
@8
<b>shall be the offering etc.,</b> Now, if you ask, how is it possible that Jerusalem should be in its place? Was not Jerusalem on the northern border of Judah, which received the south of the land of Canaan? And here it is in the middle of the tribes! [I will answer you that] this division is not like Joshua’s division, for this one is like the rows of a vineyard and all the portions are equal, whereas [in] Joshua’s division, the tribe of Judah had such a large portion that [its territory was] too much for it until Simeon took part of it as is said (Josh. 19:9): “Out of the lot of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon.” Therefore, the width of the portion that Judah received in the days of Joshua suffices now for the five remaining tribes to take a share of it, because its length was very great, from the eastern side to the ocean, and Jerusalem is located there.

Thus we have 5,000 by 5,000 in the middle of the strip, thereby filling its entire width. In the length of this third strip, 10,000 are left to the east and 10,000 are left to the west.

<b>and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash</b> He was of the sons of Jehu [i.e., a great grandson of Jehu], and he too reigned with Uzziah and Jotham, but a meritorious deed caused him to be counted with these righteous men, since he did not heed slander concerning Amos, as is explained in Pesachim, in the chapter entitled הָאִשָּׁה, “The woman” (87b), as it is stated: “(Amos 7:10) And Amaziah sent etc. ‘Amos has conspired against you etc.’”

<b>At the beginning of the Lord’s speaking to Hosea</b> Lit. in the beginning the Lord spoke to Hosea. Therefore, our Rabbis stated: The first of the four prophets who prophesied (in these days): Hosea, Isaiah, Amos, and Micah. [Parshandatha reads: in the days of Uzziah. Michah, in fact, is not mentioned as having prophesized in the days of Uzziah, but only in the days of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah; this will be explained further. In Pesachim 87a, we read: at that time] Isaiah prophesized [at the time of the earthquake (Parshandatha)], as it is stated: (Isaiah 6:4) “And the doorposts quaked etc.” And that was the day that Uzziah was stricken when he entered the Temple, for the ethereal beings clamored to burn him, and the earthly beings to swallow him as the punishment of Korah’s company, among which there were [some] swallowed up and [some] burned. Concerning Amos, it is stated: (Amos 1:1) “Two years before the earthquake.” [Amos, accordingly, preceded Isaiah.] And Micah was the last of all of them, for it is said concerning him: (Micah 1:1) “In the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,” and Uzziah is not mentioned in his regard (Cf. Pesachim 87a; Seder Olam, ch. 20; Tanhuma Tzav 13; Rashi, Isaiah 6:4). But the simple meaning of the verse is: At the beginning of the speech which the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke to Hosea, he said this to him.
<b>take yourself a wife of harlotry</b> Our Rabbis said: This is to be explained according to its apparent meaning: Since he said about Israel, “Exchange them for another nation,” as is explained in Pesachim at the beginning of the chapter entitled האשה, “The woman” (87a).
<b>and children of harlotry</b> For she will bear you children who will be of possible illegitimacy. And Jonathan paraphrased: Prophesy a prophecy about the inhabitants of the cities of idolatry. The word קַח, stated here is an expression of teaching, [derived from לֶקַח, doctrine]. Teach them to repent.
<b>goes astray</b> Heb. תִּזְנֶה. This is the present tense.

<b>Gomer</b> Our Rabbis (Pesachim 87a) said. That was her name by dint of her harlotry, for all would gratify their lust on her (גּוֹמְרִין) and they would tread upon her like a pressed fig (דְּבֵלָה). [That is a euphemism for sexual contact.] Jonathan, however, paraphrases: גֹּמֶר, that if they would return from their way, their retribution would be finished, and if not, they will be like unripe figs falling from the fig tree.

<b>And the number...shall be</b> What is the connection of retribution and consolation juxtaposed in one speech? Our Rabbis explained in Pesachim (87b): Hosea felt that he had sinned by saying, “Exchange them for another nation.” He stood and begged mercy for them (See above 1:2). And in Sifrei Devei Rav, in the section commencing: “And Israel abode in Shittim” (Num. 25) we learned: Rabbi says: Some sections are close to each other yet as far apart as east is far from west. “For you are not My people... And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea.” What is the connection of one to the other? This can be compared to a king who became angry with his wife. He summoned a scribe to come and write a bill of divorcement. Before the scribe arrived, the king became reconciled with his wife. Said the king, “Is it possible that this scribe should leave here divided?” I.e. his heart should be divided and bewildered, saying, “Why did the king send for me?” He said to him, “Come and write that I am doubling her kethubah.” And according to its simple meaning, this is the reason for its juxtaposition. “For you are not My people, and I will not be yours.” I will show Myself as though I am not yours, and you shall be exiled among the nations, and even there you shall multiply and grow, and there you shall lay it to your heart to return to Me, as it is said through Moses (Deut. 30:1,3): “And you shall lay it to your heart among all the nations where...has exiled you etc. And the Lord your God shall return your captivity.” Here too, “And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together.”

<b>and lead her into the desert</b> In exile, which is to her like a desert and a wasteland. And there she will lay up to her heart that it was better for her when she performed My will than when she rebelled against Me.
@17
<b>her vineyards</b> Jonathan rendered this as an expression of managers and leaders. Comp. (Job 24: 18) “he will not face the way of the vineyards,” meaning that the people of the generation of the flood had made up their mind not to follow the righteous leaders, such as Noah and Methusalah. And so, (Song 1:6) “my vineyard I did not guard.” The allusion is to the worship of idols instead of worshipping God, the Leader. Another explanation:
<b>and lead her into the desert</b> To the desert of Sihon and Og, and with the same expression Ezekiel prophesied (20:35, 38), “And I will bring you there to the desert of the peoples, and I will contend with you there, etc. As I continued with your forefathers etc., and I will bring them into the tradition of the covenant. And I will purge you of those who rebel...” but the righteous I will keep alive. That is the intention of “her vineyards.” [from Ruth Rabbah 5:6, Pesikta d’Rav Kahana 49b].

Concerning our father Abraham, it is written (Gen 18:19): “For I love him since he commands etc. to perform righteousness and justice.” And, corresponding to them, He bestowed upon his children loving-kindness and mercy, as it is said (Deut. 13:18): “And He shall grant you mercy”; (ibid. 7:12) “And the Lord your God shall keep for you the covenant and the loving-kindness.” When they ceased to perform righteousness and justice, as it is said (Amos 5:7): “Those who turn justice into wormwood, and righteousness they leave on the ground,” also the Holy One, blessed be He, took away from them the loving-kindness and the mercy, as it is said (Jer. 16:5): “for I have gathered in My peace from this people, says the Lord, the loving- kindness and the mercies.” And when they will return to perform righteousness and justice, they shall be redeemed immediately, as it is said (Isa. 1:27): “Zion shall be redeemed through justice, and her penitent through righteousness.” And the Holy One, blessed be He, will add mercy and loving- kindness to them and make a crown of all four of them and place it on their head.

<b>goblets of grapes</b> Heb. אֲשִׁישֵׁי עֲנָבִים. Menahem (Machbereth p. 34) explains. ‘goblets of wine.’ They are fond of becoming drunk with their wine and do not engage in Torah. And so we find that elsewhere he castigates for this: “that drink wine in bowls, etc” (Amos 6:6).
@2
<b>And I bought her</b> It is an expression of a business transaction, ‘bargaine’ in Old French, similar to “which I have purchased (כָּרִיתִי) for me” (Gen. 50:5). Now in the sea-towns they refer to a sale (Heb. מְכִירָה) as כִּירָה [from Hullin 92a].
<b>for fifteen pieces of silver, and a chomer of barley and a lethech of barley</b> Jonathan paraphrases: “And I redeemed them at My command on the fifteenth day of the month of Nisan, and I made shekalim of silver an atonement for their souls, and I declared that they offer before me an ‘omer’ as heave-offering from the barley harvest; that is to say, I did not weary you with difficult duties.”
<b>for fifteen pieces of silver</b> It is the numerical equivalent of Nissan. Now in the Pesikta it is expounded: “fifteen pieces of silver,” on the fifteenth day of Nissan. Now a chomer and a lethech total forty-five, for the chomer equals thirty seah, and the lethech is a half- chomer.
@3
<b>and I said to her: You shall remain as mine for many days</b> The plural “days” refers to (a minimum) of two, “many” to (a minimum of) three, making a total of five. This (the forty-five of the previous verse added to the five of this verse) alludes to the fifty days between Passover and Pentecost. On that day I offered her the Torah, admonishing her:
<b>you shall not play the harlot and you shall not belong to another man</b> [that is], “You shall have no other gods before Me” (Exodus 20:3); so...
<b>will I be towards you</b> “I am the Lord your God” (Ex. 20:2). Now the reason he split the fifty days into separate calculations, one at the conclusion of “chomer” (i.e., 50 days), the other at the conclusion of “lethech” (i.e., the ensuing 15 days), is to represent the “manna” that descended upon them at the culmination of thirty days [from their exodus] on the fifteenth day (sic) of Iyar. From that point, for an [additional] fifteen daysthe numerical equivalent of the number of seah in a lethechon that day they arrived in the Sinai desert on the first day of the month of Sivan. Now in the name of Rav Hai I found a most fitting thing: “So I bought her to me etc.,” (verse 2) I have established her atonement indemnity money as a light sum, for whosoever states: “My valuation is incumbent upon me to contribute to the sanctuary, should he be from the age of sixty and above” his valuation shall be fifteen shekels (Lev. 27:7). This sum of fifteen shekels is, according to this interpretation, symbolized by the fifteen pieces of silver of v. 2): Now the “chomer” of barley [represents] the valuation of a male aged twenty and above until sixty, viz. fifty shekels (see Lev. 27:3), the amount of redemption money of a chomer of barley which is similarly fifty silver shekels (See Lev. 27:16: “And if a man shall dedicate to the Lord some part of his field...the seed of a “chomer” of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.”) Now regarding the lethech of barley, the amount for redeeming a field containing a lethech of barley for the sanctuary is twenty-five shekels, which is [equal to the sum of] the valuation of someone from one month up to five years, which equals five shekels (Lev. 27:6), and that of one from five years up to twenty years, in which cases, “the valuation shall be twenty shekels (Lev. 27:5),” totalling twenty-five shekels. After all this display of affection [by allowing for such relatively easy absolution,] I said to her:
<b>[3] You shall remain as mine for many days; you shall not play the harlot</b> by turning to other gods, for, if you do play the harlot, your children shall remain for many days...

<b>Afterwards</b> Following the days of exile.
<b>shall the children of Israel return</b> It was taught in the name of R. Shimon the son of Yochai: The children of Israel rejected three things during the reign of Rehoboam; the Kingdom of Heaven, the kingdom of the House of David, and the Holy Temple, as it is written: “What portion have we in David” (I Kings 12:16) which may be understood literally; “to your tents O’ Israel” (ibid.), do not read, “to your tents” (Heb. לְאֹהָלֶךָ) but “to your gods” (Heb. לֵאלֹהֶֶךָ) “now see your own house, David” (ibid.), refers to the Holy Temple (see Rashi I Kings 12:16). R. Shimon the son of Menassiah said: Israel shall not be shown any omen of good until they repent by seeking out all three; “Afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek their Lord their God,” which refers to the Kingdom of Heaven; “and David their king” is self explanatory; “and shall come trembling to the Lord and to His goodness,” which refers to the Holy Temple, as it is written “that good mount” (Deut. 3:7) (a reference to the Temple Mount.

<b>the more they have sinned against me</b> As they multiplied and increased, so they continued to sin. (Heb. כֵן חָטְאוּ.) So is the Hebrew expression in numerous places: “As they afflicted them, so they increased (Heb. כֲּאֲשֶׁר יְעַנוּ אוֹתוֹ כֵן יִרְבֶּה);” “As they called them so they turned away from them, (Heb. קָרְאוּ לָהֶם כֵּן הָלְכוּ מִפְּנֵיהֶם Hosea 11:2),” the more the prophets called after them to rebuke them, so they ran away from them.
<b>the more they have increased the more they have sinned</b> Therefore “I will exchange their glory for shame.”
@8
<b>the sin-offerings of My people</b> Heb. חַטַּאתעַמִּי. Every (mention of) חַטַּאת in the books of the Twelve Prophets appear with (the diacritical voweling of) ‘patachin’ (under the letter ט) as follows: חַטַּאת, since all are connected (to the following word) with the exception of one: “she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion. (Heb. חַטָּאתהִיא לְבַתצִיוּן Michah 1:3).” The sin-offerings of my nation shall be eaten by the false prophets concerning whom had been stated above: “and the prophet that is with you shall also stumble with you (v. 5).” They became for them priests of the high places who would eat what the legitimate priests should rightfully have eaten.

<b>elms</b> ‘olma’ in old French, whose branches are many and are planted for shade.
<b>therefore</b> Because you participate in idolatry, and the gentile nations join you, you therefore intermarry with them; [hence] your daughters born to you from their daughters act in the manner of their mothers and commit adultery. So does Jonathan interpret.
@14
<b>I will not punish your daughters</b> anymore, to test them with the ‘bitter waters’ should they commit adultery. Why? Because their husbands join with harlots; for once the man is not free of sin, the waters do not test his wife. [based on Sifrei Num. 5:82 and Sotah 47a]
<b>join</b> Heb. יִפָרֵדוּ. Jonathan translates מִסְתַייעָן from סִיעָה, ‘a company,’ that is, they join with them (the harlots) in drinking wine. Now Menahem [Machbereth Menahem p. 145] connects it with עָבְשוּ פְרוּדוֹת “the wine barrels decay” (of Joel 1:17) where they (פְרוּדוֹת) are wine barrels.
<b>the people that does not understand shall be knocked about</b> Because you do not set your heart to comprehend, therefore you shall be knocked about, struck with (divine) visitation: יִלָּבֵט is an expression of road weariness and toilsome burden, ‘dיlaser’ in old French.
@15
<b>Though you, O Israel, play the harlot</b> the sons of Judah ought not learn their (sic) way. An alternate explanation is: Though you, O Israel, play the harlot, let not Judah become guilty. Though Israel is as a harlot, the sons of Judah are not guilty thereof, and I shall [therefore] not hold them accountable, as it is written above (1:17): “But I will have compassion upon the house of Judah.”
<b>and do not come</b> you sons of Judah to Gilgal. (Judah shall be blameless) provided the sons of Judah do not come to Gilgal where the ten tribes worship [idols], as it is stated: “All their wickedness is in Gilgal” (Hosea 9:15); “[Come] to Gilgal and multiply transgression” (Amos 4:4).
<b>nor go up to Beth- aven</b> This is Bethel (which is called by the pejorative, Beth-aven, house of iniquity), for Jeroboam set up the calves there.
<b>nor swear</b> with them (the Israelite kingdom) “as the Lord lives,” “for if they say, ‘As the Lord lives,’ they, nevertheless, swear falsely” (Jer. 5:2). When they swore falsely, they would mention the name of Heaven, but when they swore truthfully, they would swear in the name of the Baalim.

<b>and they shall be ashamed of their altars</b> Heb. מִזְבְּחוֹתָם, of the altars of their deities (lit. their abominations), to which they do not turn. Now, just as חֵטְא, sin, can be stated in the feminine as חֲטָאָה, so can one say, instead of זֶבח, זִבְחָה, which denotes the places where they would sacrifice. And so did Jonathan render: of the altars of their abominations. Addendum according to Abarbanel: I found a Midrash Tanhuma, where it is an expression of tying, like a man who threatens a person who provokes him, “[I swear] by your life that I will tie it to you at your end.” So does this verse threaten Israel: “My zeal and My fury are tied up to avenge Myself at the end, and they will be ashamed of their deeds.”

<b>The extent of their straying they have deepened</b> The extent of their straying they have deepened. I said that anyone who does not go up to Jerusalem on the Pilgrimage festivals transgresses a positive commandment, and they decreed that anyone who does go up to Jerusalem shall be put to death. Hence, they went deeper than I. I.e., they were more stringent than I (Sanhedrin 102a). The word שַחֲטָה, translated as ‘extent’ is an expression similar to זָהָב שָׁחוּט, “malleable gold” (I Kings 10:16) stretched and spun. Jonathan, however, renders it as an expression of slaughtering sacrifices to idols.

<b>for now you have committed harlotry, O Ephraim</b> Until Hosea son of Elah, they blamed their sins on their kings, who prevented them from going on the pilgrimages. This one arose and abolished the sentries; yet they did not go up. Therefore, they were exiled. For now you have committed harlotry, O Ephraim, and they cannot blame the king. I learned this in Seder Olam (ch. 22).

<b>And the pride of Israel shall be humbled</b> Heb. וְעָנָה. Jonathan renders: And the pride of Israel shall be humbled. Comp. (Exodus 10:13) “to humble yourself (לֵעָנֹת) from before Me.” An expression of poverty and humility.

And Dunash ben Livrat explained it (וְעָנָה) as an expression of testimony; when their retribution comes to them, the pride and haughtiness, which they were haughty, and transgressing My will, will testify against them and before them. [from Teshuvoth Dunash, p.79]

Jonathan, however, renders: Sound a shofar: [O prophets, raise your voices like a shofar.] The news of the sword which is coming as retribution for the iniquity of crowning Saul, who was in Gibeah, and for disobeying Samuel, who was from Ramah. And their kings caused them to turn away from following Me, such as Jeroboam and his ilk. Shout over them, “Violence and great destruction!”
<b>“After you, Benjamin!”</b> Since you delayed and hesitated to go on the pilgrimages to the Temple, which is in Benjamin’s territory. Because of your delay of Benjamin. [explaining according to Targum Jonathan]

<b>shall be bewildered on the day of contention</b> When I come to debate with them, they will be bewildered and will wonder, and they will have no answer in their mouth. Why? Because, among the tribes of Israel I made known a true Torah, and they transgressed it. [Another explanation:]
<b>Ephraim shall be bewildered etc. among the tribes of Israel I made known a true [judgment]</b> Said Rabbi Abahu in the name of Rabbi Yose bar Chanina. On the day that the Holy One, blessed be He, debates with them in judgment, they will not be able to open their mouths, for among their tribes I made known that the judgment is a true judgment. You find that, when the ten tribes were exiled, Benjamin and Judah were not exiled, and the ten tribes were saying, Because they are the dwellers of His palace, He did not exile them. There is favoritism in this matter. God forbid, there is no favoritism, but their measure of sin was not yet full. As soon as they sinned, they were exiled. Then the ten tribes were bewildered, without an answer in their mouths, and they said, “Behold God! Behold the Mighty One! Behold the Just One! For even to those who dwell in His house He shows no favoritism.” This is to fulfill what is stated: Among the tribes of Israel I made known a true judgment. [from Lam. Rabbah, Proem 6]

<b>like those who remove the landmark</b> As a person who attaches the landmark of his neighbor, so did they hasten to grasp the ways of Israel, their colleagues, the kings. Therefore, “upon them will I pour My wrath like water.” And, according to its apparent meaning, they were stealing fields. But it is difficult to me, since he should have written. מַסִיגֵי גְבוּל, those who remove the landmark, not כְּמַסִיגֵי like those who remove.

<b>and he will not remove the pain from you</b> Heb. וְלֹא יִגְהֶה מִכֶּם מָזוֹר. And I say that it is one of the words whose radicals are transposed. This is an expression similar to (II Sam. 20:13) “When he was removed (הוֹגָה) from the highway”; (Isaiah 59:13) “sprouting and giving forth (והוֹגוֹ) from the heart”; (Prov. 25:4), “take away (הָגוֹ) the dross from the silver.”

<b>for they devised a plot</b> For this is a plot which they plotted prior to their gathering, to which place they would go to murder and to loot. וּכְחַכֵּי means ajjmedours in O.F, fishermen. And also in mishnaic Hebrew, חַכֵּי is an expression of joining. The Gemara states (Baba Kamma 119b): “And he shall not put into it more than three חַכִּין.” Those are the stitches with which the comber joins together both ends of the garment when he beats it with sticks. This [following] interpretation is mine, and it seems appropriate, and this is the explanation: And when there is a group of five men gathering together, it is a company of priests to murder. The first one is that of Rabbi Meir Sheliach Zibbur o.b.m.
<b>in one group</b> Heb. שֶׁכְמָה, an expression of one group.
@10

<b>from the kneading the dough until it leavens</b> From the time he thinks of the evil in his heart, how he will do it, he rests and sleeps until morning, when he can do it, just as the baker rests from the kneading of the dough until it leavens, when he can bake it. And so it is stated in Micah (2: 1): “Woe is to those who plan iniquity and work evil on their beds; when the morning lights up, they do it.”

<b>their baker sleeps</b> i.e., until morning they sleep, and in the morning they burn like fire until they consummate their evil.
@7
<b>and they devour their judges</b> They slew their Sanhedrin because they protested against them, and what happened to them?
<b>All their kings have fallen because</b> “none of them calls to me.” And in the Palestinian Talmud in tractate Avodah Zarah (1:1) it is expounded as follows: On the day they crowned Jeroboam, “the princes became ill from the heat of wine” as is explained. They came to him and said to him, “Get up! Make idols for us.” He replied, “Now is the time of evening, and all the people are drinking”; i.e., it is a time of drunkenness. Perhaps now you are drunk, and tomorrow you will recant. “Go and return in the morning.” They went and returned in the morning. That is what is written: “For they have made ready etc.” He said to them, “I fear your Sanhedrin.” They replied, “We will kill them.” I.e. what is written: “And they devour their judges.” “He draws his hand etc.” When he saw a righteous man, he would seat two scorners next to him, and they would say to him, “Which generation was the most beloved of all generations?” And he would reply, “The generation of the desert.” And they would say to him, “Did they not worship idols?” And he would reply, “Since they were beloved, they were not punished.” And they would say to him, “Quiet! The king wants to do that.”
@8
<b>mingles</b> He will mingle in exile with the nations.
<b>as a cake which was not turned over</b> Jonathan renders: as a cake which, before being turned over, was consumed. עֻגָה is a cake which they bake on the coals.
@9
<b>but he did not know</b> He did not lay it up to his heart that the kings of Aram consumed him in the days of Jehoahaz, as it is said: (II Kings 13:7) “For he had not left to Jehoahaz etc. and made them like dust to trample.” Nonetheless, Jeroboam his son did not repent of his father’s evil.
<b>also weakness was cast</b> Heb. שֵׂיבָה, lit. ripe old age. Jonathan rendered. Also weakness reached them, but they did not contemplate it.
@10
<b>And the pride of Israel was humbled before Him</b> Heb. וְעָנָה. And the glory of Israel was humbled and they saw; an expression of humility, and this is not a future tense but a past tense. Comp. (Isa. 6: 3) “And one called (וְקָרָא) to the other.” I heard that one called to the other. Also (Gen. 37:3) “and he made (וְעָשָׂה) for him a woolen shirt.” This too is a past tense. They have already been diminished and humbled, and, despite this, they did not return to the Lord.

<b>When they go</b> to Egypt.
<b>I will spread My net over them; like the fowl of the heaven</b> For the eagle and the hawk ascend higher than he and they bring them down to the earth, so will I bring them down in Egypt through Nebuchadnezzar. Another explanation: like the fowl of the heaven that is caught in a net hung on poles, and after they are in the net, they bring down the net.
<b>I will chastise them as I let their congregation hear</b> I will bring chastisements upon them according to all that I let them hear through Jeremiah the prophet, that they are destined to say to him (42:2-6) “And pray in our behalf etc. And let the Lord your God tell etc. Whether good or bad etc.” And he said to them (verse 15f.), “If you direct your faces to come to Egypt etc. the sword that you fear will overtake you there,” and the entire section.
<b>I will chastise them</b> Heb. אַיְסִירֵם, an expression of chastisements (יִסּוּרִין) and Menahem (Machbereth Menahem pp. 128f.) explained [it as] an expression of binding. Comp. (Jer. 30:8) “and I will break your thongs (מוֹסְרוֹתֶיךָ),” but Dunash (Teshuvoth Dunash p. 34) interpreted [it as] an expression of chastisements (יִסּוּרִין). Comp. (Lev. 26:18) “to chastise you (לְיַסְרָה).” And the second “yud” in אַיְסִירֵם is added, as it is added in (יַיְשִׁירוּ) (Prov. 4:25) “and your eyelids look straight (יַיְשִירוּ) ahead of you.”

<b>they were like a deceitful bow</b> which, when one wishes to shoot with it toward the north, shoots toward the south.

Another explanation: [הֵשִּׂירוּ is like הֵסִירוּ, they removed,] they removed this one from the throne and crowned this one, and in the book of the Masorah, this is proven, for he classified it in the Masorah of those written with a “shin” and read as a “samech,” bearing the meaning of the “samech.”

<b>For it is from Israel</b> From each one’s silver and gold it was collected, and the craftsman made it. And the “vav” of וְהוּא is superfluous, and there are many like it, e.g. (Ezekiel 47:11), “Its swamps and its pools shall not become healthy (וְלֹא יֵרָפְאוּ).” Here too, for its preparation is from Israel and it is made. And this “vav” may be reconciled in the following manner: כִּי מִיִשְׂרָאֵל וְהוּא Also, this calf came from them like the first calf.

@9
<b>a wild donkey secluded to himself</b> He became like a wild donkey that goes alone to itself, sniffing air from place to place to wander.
<b>they paid hire for love</b> Heb. הִתְנוּ. Jonathan interprets it as an expression of a dragon; like this dragon that goes through the deserts. They sniffed the air like the dragon to acquire for themselves lovers, strange paramours. הִתְנוּ, endragonיrיnt in O.F., like the tremors of the nostrils of a dragon, [derived from תַּנִין. According to this derivation we render: dragonlike, they sought lovers.] It may also be explained as an expression of hire.
@10

<b>for their bread is for themselves</b> It is fit for them for food, but not to come into the house of the Lord. Another explanation is: אוֹנִים, like bread of mourners, which is contaminated, and the end of the verse proves it: all those who partake thereof become contaminated.

<b>As for Ephraimtheir honor shall fly away like a bird etc.</b> Said the prophet: If only they would be like a bird that wanders from its nest and ceases to multiply, so should they be bereft of their seed, either at the time of birth, or that it should disintegrate and they should miscarry, or at the time of conception that they should not conceive, for what use is it that they raise their children, since, if they raise them, I will bereave them before they become men.
@12
<b>for woe... also</b> Woe to the fathers.
<b>when I turn away from them</b> Heb. בְּשוּרִי, like בְּסוּרִי, when I turn away from them. This is one of the words listed in the Masorah, which are spelled with a “sin” but read with a “sammech.” Another explanation:
<b>their honor shall fly away like a bird etc.</b> Like this bird which flies away and is no more, so will their honor fly away and flee, all that they toiled with their children in birth, [in the womb,] and in conception.
<b>From birth</b> This refers to the birth pangs.
<b>and from the womb</b> This refers to the days of pregnancy.
<b>and from conception</b> At the time of coitus. All this toil of theirs will end. How so? For, when they raise their children, I will bereave them.
@13

@14
<b>Give them, O Lord, what You will give</b> The prophet prays that they should die when young, for the mourning for a child is not as bad as the mourning for an adult. Therefore, if it is impossible that they die from birth, from the womb, or from conception, for it was already decreed from the Creation of the world, (Gen. 3: l6) “And to your husband shall be your longing,” give them quickly in their childhood what you say to give to them after a time, for You said, “For, if they raise their children. I will bereave them.” [from Pesikta Rabbathi 45:3]
<b>give them a bereaving womb</b> When they emerge into the world (lit. the air of the world), let them die or let their mother’s breasts dry up so that they will have no milk to nurse them.
@15
<b>All their evil is in Gilgal</b> There they worshipped idols to a great extent (on high placesabsent in mss.). Since the mishkan was there first, the prophets of Baal would tell them that was a choice site, and it belonged to the kings of Israel.

<b>fruit fitting for it</b> The fruit that is fitting for them and good for them.
<b>When I increased their good, they increased for the altars</b> When I lavished good upon them, they made many calves for the altars. Another explanation
<b>Israel is a plundered vine;</b> the produce of their deeds brought it about to them. פְּרִי יְשַׁוֶּה לוֹ means ‘will avail them’ to be plundered, for they made the altars and availed their nation for evil. This is the wording of the Targum.
<b>they increased pillars</b> Heb. הֵטִיבוּ מַצֵבוֹת.
@2
<b>Their heart has parted</b> from Me.
<b>now they shall be desolate. That</b> is the thing that shall demolish (וְעָרְפוּ) thier altars, i.e., it will destroy them. This is an expression similar to (Deut. 21:4) “and they shall dehead (יַעֲרֹף)”; (Ex. 13:13) “and you shall behead it (וְעֲרַפְתּוֹ).” He will break their neck. Another explanation according to Midrash Aggadah: Peace is great, for, even if Israel worships idols, but there is peace among them, Satan does not bring charges against them, as it is said: (above 4:17) “Ephraim is joined: although he worships idols, let him alone.” Strife, however, is hated, as it is said: “Their heart has parted; now they will be guilty.” Satan can open his mouth to bring charges.

<b>on the furrows of the field</b> for the iniquity that they move back the boundaries of the field.
<b>the furrows</b> Heb. תַּלְמֵי. The furrow of a plowshare is called תֶּלֶם. Another explanation:
<b>on the furrows of the field</b> where they erect their altars, as it is said (below 12:12): “like heaps on the furrows of the field.” There the judgment for their iniquity shall spring up on them. Another explanation:
<b>swearing falsely</b> Every covenant they form with one another they break.
<b>and...shall spring up like hemlock</b> which springs up on the furrows of the field, which is a bitter grass, so do their judgments spring up and bitterness grows for the poor and needy. Amos, too, says: (6:12) “For you have turned judgment into hemlock.”

<b>Because of the calves of Beth-aven etc.</b> Because of the retribution destined to befall the calves in Bethel, called Beth-aven in the Book of Joshua (7:2).
<b>shall be frightened</b> Heb. יָגוּרוּ. Its neighbors who were in Samaria shall be frightened over it. Why? For its people mourn over it, and its priests, who would constantly rejoice over it will not mourn over its glory, for it has been exiled.
@6
<b>That too shall be carried off to Assyria</b> This took place in the twelfth year of Ahaz, “And the Lord (sic) aroused the desire of Pul king of Assyria...and they exiled the Reubenites and the Gadites etc.” (I Chron. 5:26), and he took the golden calves that were in Bethel and went away, to fulfill what was said: “That too shall be carried off to Assyria.” [from Seder Olam ch. 22]
<b>a gift to King Yareb</b> This is Sennacherib.
<b>Ephraim shall take shame</b> Heb. בָּשְׁנָה. Jeroboam, who was from the tribe of Ephraim, shall take shame for himself, that he erected this calf for a deity.
<b>and Israel shall be ashamed</b> of that counsel that they took counsel to make them, as it is said: (I Kings 12:28) “The king took counsel and made two golden calves.”

<b>The king of Samaria is silenced</b> Heb. נִדְמֶה. The king of Samaria is silenced, and he is like foam on the surface of the water, which is eskoume (ecume) in Old French.

<b>thorns and thistles shall come up on their altars</b> for their worshippers have gone into exile, and no one turns to them anymore.

<b>to the mountains, Cover us up</b> lest our enemies see our shame.
@9
<b>Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel!</b> Heb. חָטָאתָ. This word חָטָאת is punctuated weakly, since it is of the feminine gender and of the past tense. Comp. (Lev. 25:21) וְעָשָת, “and it shall produce”; (Gen. 16:8) בָאת, “have you come”; (Deut. 32:36) אָזְלַת, “their power is gone.” From the days of Gibeah of Benjamin, Israel sinned. Since the incident of the concubine in Gibeah (Jud. 19) took place during the time of Othniel the son of Kenaz, who was the first of the judges, at the time of Cushan-rishathaim, and in whose time the image of Micah existed, and all this we find in Seder Olam (ch. 12).
<b>There they remained</b> They adhered to that trait since then.
<b>the battle...did not overtake them in Gibeah</b> Since the iniquity of idolatry was with them and they were not concerned about it, they were not victorious in the battle of Gibeah against the Benjaminites. Scripture calls them בְּנֵי עַלְוָה, lit. sons of haughtiness, who made themselves superior (עֶלְיוֹנִים) and did not heed their brethren to deliver the people of Gibeah. Jonathan, however, translates this in reference to their request for a king and their crowning Saul. However this does not appear to me to follow the Hebrew wording. Moreover, the context fits the former interpretation.
@10
<b>With My will, I chastised them</b> According to My will, I always chastised them from judge to judge, and I delivered them into the hands of their plunderers.
<b>and nations shall gather about them, when they bind them to their two eyes</b> Since Hosea compares them to a heifer as stated further: “Ephraim is a goaded heifer,” he, therefore, compared their chastisement to a cow, which they tire with plowing and they bind it to the yoke of the plowshare, and the pegs of the yoke penetrate it, [i.e., they penetrate the yoke,] one on this side and one on that side, next to the ox’s two eyes. And so did Jonathan render: as one hinds a “padna” on its two eyes. “Padna” is a yoke of oxen.
@11
<b>And Ephraim is a goaded heifer</b> Heb. מְלֻמָּדָה, porpojjnte in O.F. punctured, wounded in many places with the oxgoad, which is called agojjlon in O.F. I.e., many chastisements have I brought upon her, yet she has not humbled herself, and he always loves to thresh the grain in a place of food and fat, and she did not subject herself to be plowing, i.e., they did not subject themselves to My Torah, but follow the vision of their heart.
<b>that loves</b> Heb. אֹהַבְתִּי. The “yud” is superfluous. Comp. (Gen. 31: 39) “stolen by day (גְּנֻבְתִי).”
<b>and I passed over her fair neck</b> Therefore, I bring upon them kings who will weaken their strength.
<b>I will cause Ephraim to ride, Judah shall plow etc.</b> If you wish that I would cause Ephraim to ride upon the nations, Judah shall plow, and Jacob יְשַּׂדֶד, shall break his clods with a plowing of good deeds, as Hosea explains and says: plow yourselves a plowing etc.
@12
<b>Sow righteousness for yourselves</b> But you have plowed wickedness etc.; therefore, a tumult shall rise in your people.
<b>plow yourselves a plowing</b> Engage in the Torah and from there you will learn to go on the good way, to overpower temptation, like a person who plows the field to turn over the roots of grasses which sap the strength of the grain in the summer many days prior to sowing, and you shall set aside a time to seek the Lord, i.e., for the study of the Torah.
<b>until He comes and instructs you in righteousness</b> When you toil in it, He will give you to understand to let you know its secrets with righteousness. Another explanation:
<b>Plow yourselves a plowing</b> Do good deeds before oppression comes upon you, and that will cause for you that your prayer will be accepted in time of necessity, and then it will be a time fit for you to seek the Holy One, blessed he He, for all your necessities, for then your cry will be heard, and He will cast down (יוֹרֶה) charity to you; i.e., He will rain down charity to you. Comp. (Ex. 15:3) “He cast (יָרָה) into the sea.”
@13
<b>you have eaten fruit of lies</b> You have received the retribution for your deeds.
@14
<b>And a tumult shall rise in your peoples</b> i.e., a voice shouting, “Flee! Flee!”
<b>as the plunder of a peaceful people by an ambush</b> Like plunderers who come upon a tranquil people suddenly with an ambush, for they did not beware of them to flee from before them, and they plunder everything.
<b>an ambush</b> Heb. בֵּיתאַרְבֵּאל. Jonathan renders: a place of ambush (בֵּיתמַאֲרָב), and the “aleph” “lammed” are superfluous. Comp. יִזְרְעֶאל, which is not the name of a city, e.g., (above 2: 24) “And they shall answer Jezreel,” and he called it with the expression of a name. Here, too, he called it as a sort of name. In this manner, Menahem (Machbereth Menahem p. 34) classified it, but Dunash (Teshuvoth Dunash p. 49) interprets it as a placename.
<b>was dashed to pieces</b> Heb. רֻטָּשָׁה, split. Comp. (Isa. 13:18) “shall dash (תְּרַטַשְנָא) youths”; (ibid. v. 16) “and their babes shall be dashed (יְרֻטָשׁוּ) .” Another explanation of רֻטָּשָׁה is “abandoned,” like נֻטָּשָׁה.
@15
<b>So has Bethel done to you</b> The calf in Bethel has brought about all this retribution upon you.
<b>the evil of your wickedness</b> Heb., lit. the evil of your evil. Because of the evil of your wickedness, the sins of your evil intention.
<b>at dawn the king of Israel has been silenced</b> Heb. נִדְמֹה נִדְמָה. He has sunk into a deep sleep as though it were night; i.e. he has no strength. Now why has all this come about? For when Israel was young, devoid of all good, I loved him.

<b>and from Egypt I called My son</b> through My prophets to cleave to My Torah. But what did they do?...
@2
<b>The more they called to them, the more they went away from them</b> As much as the prophets call to teach them the good way, so did they turn their backs to run away from them and they would slaughter sacrifices to the baalim. It is customary for Scripture to speak in this manner. Comp. (above 4:7) “The more they have increased, the more they have sinned against Me”; (Ex. 1:12) “And the more they afflicted them, the more they increased.”
@3
<b>But I sent to train Ephraim, he took them etc.</b> I sent a leader before them who would train them gently.
<b>he took them on his arms</b> This is Moses, concerning whom it is stated (Num. 11:12): “As the nursing father carries the sucking child.” The form תִּרְגַּלְתִּי is like הִרגַּלְתִּי, I trained, or accustomed, and there is no similar form in Scripture.
<b>but they did not know that I healed them</b> They, in fact, knew, but they trod with their heels; they pretended not to know. The Aggadah in the Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (Gen. 48:1) expounds it in reference to the sons of Joseph. When he brought them before Jacob to bless them, Jacob perceived wicked men destined to come from Ephraim, viz. Jeroboam and Ahab, and the Holy Spirit left him, “and he said: Who are these?” Joseph prayed for mercy, and the Holy Spirit rested on Jacob and he blessed them. This is the meaning of: And I trained My spirit upon Jacob for Ephraim’s benefit, and he took them on his arms.
@4
<b>with cords of a man</b> I constantly drew them with tender cords with which a man draws his son; i.e., drawing mercifully. Jonathan, too, rendered it in this manner.
<b>and I was to them like those who lift the yoke on their bridles</b> I.e., like the good farmers who lift the yoke with their hands through bridles to lighten it for the cow that is plowing. So was I with them in every trouble, to make it lighter for them. Another explanation:
<b>like those who lift the yoke on their bridles</b> Like the farmers who lift the yoke off the neck of the cow or the ox by lengthening the peg upon which the yoke is placed, to lighten it for the plowing cow. So was I with them in every trouble to make it lighter for them. So did Jonathan render it: like a good farmer [who makes it lighter for the shoulders of the oxen and lengthens their bridles.]
<b>on their bridles</b> Heb. אוֹכִיל, an expression of a stake of an alley.
<b>and I extended to him the ability to bear</b> I extended him the strength to bear the yoke of the torments. Jonathan renders: referring to His supplying them food in the desert.
@5
<b>He shall not return to the land of Egypt</b> I promised him (Ex. 14:13): “you shall no longer continue to see them etc.” Now what did it avail? Against his will, Assyria is his king. They sinned and brought about that they should be vassals to Assyria since they refused to repent.
@6
<b>And a sword shall rest in his cities</b> Heb. וְחָלָה, and a sword shall rest in his cities.
<b>and it shall destroy his branches, and it shall consume</b> And it shall destroy his mighty men and consume them. [after Targum Jonathan]
<b>because of their counsels</b> (all these came upon them.) The word מִמֹּעֲצוֹתֵיהֶם is punctuated by two accents: it contains a tipcha and it contains a silluk (sof passuk), since it is a clause by itself. Comp. (Lev. 21:4) לְהֵחַלְוֹ, “for him to become profaned,” of the verse commencing, “A husband shall not contaminate himself.” Similarly, (Ex. 30:3l) לדֹרֹתֵיכֶם, “to your generations,” of the verse dealing with the holy anointing oil.
@7
<b>And My people waver whether to return to Me</b> When the prophets teach them to return to Me, they are in doubt whether to return or not to return; it is with difficulty that they return to Me.
<b>and to the matter concerning which they call them, together they do not uphold it</b> And to the matter concerning which the prophets call them, together My people will not uphold it and will not agree to do it. Some explain וְאֶל-עַל יִקְרָאֻהוּ to mean: Harsh happenings shall befall them. The word וְאֶל means the same as (Gen. 31:29) “My hand has power (לְאֵל),” [and the word עַל means the same as עֲלִילוֹת, deeds (Kara). But this is not so since אֶל is vowelized with a “pattah.” [I.e. with a “segol,” called “pattah katan” by the early grammarians.] Were אֶל a noun, it would be vowelized with a “tseireh,” [i.e., אֵל]. Jonathan, however, renders: A harsh happening will befall them. He interprets וְאֶל as an expression of harshness, but it appears to me that I have interpreted it properly.
<b>together they do not uphold [it]</b> [Jonathan renders:] Together they shall not walk erect.
@8
<b>deliver you</b> Heb. אֲמַגֶּנְךָ. Comp. (Gen. 14:20) “Who delivered (מִגֵן) your adversaries.”
<b>My remorse has been kindled</b> Heb. נִכְרְמוּ, are heated. This is an Aramaic expression. Comp. (Lam. 5:10) “Our skin is heated (נִכְמָרוּ) like an oven.”
@9
<b>I will not return</b> from My good word, which I said. (Lev. 26:44) “I have not rejected them nor have I abhorred them,” to destroy Ephraim.

<b>I will not enter a city</b> I.e., another city. I have already promised to cause My Shechinah to rest in your midst in Jerusalem, and I will never again cause it to rest on another city. Others explain it as an expression of hatred. Comp. (I Sam. 28:16) “And has become your adversary (וַיְהִי עָרֶךָ).”

Eventually, the Holy One, blessed be He, will reveal Himself to you in Bethel, and there you will find Him, and there He will speak with us, and He and I will agree with you concerning the blessings that Isaac blessed you.” Now that angel was Esau’s genius, and he was contesting the blessings.

<b>Surely I have become rich</b> Now why should I worship the Holy One, blessed be He?
<b>I have found power for myself</b> Heb. אוֹן, meaning strength. Rabbi Simon, however, explained it homiletically as follows: I found אוֹן for myself: I found a deed of indebtedness for myself, that I possess kingship over Israel. (Gen. 50:18) “And his brothers too wept and fell etc. ‘Behold we are slaves to you etc.’” אוֹן means the laws of a deed. Comp. (Gittin 43b) “They may write his deed (אוֹנוֹ) for it.” Comp. (Gittin 43b) “They may write his deed אוֹנוֹ for it.” Comp. also (Gen. Rabbah 2:2) With one deed (אוֹנוֹ) and with one price. “And this is its explanation:
<b>“And Ephraim said: Surely I have become rich; I have found a deed for myself.”</b> Jeroboam son of Nebat, who was of the tribe of Ephraim, boasts and declares: Surely I have become rich, I have found a deed for myself, one deed, that all Israel are my slaves, for my father acquired them, as it is written: And his brothers too went and fell before him, and said: Behold we are your slaves. And whatever a slave acquires belongs to his master. Hence, all their property is mine. Therefore, I have no sin if I take all that is theirs, for they are my slaves. What is written after this? And I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt. The greatness that came to your father in Egypt was from Me. Said the Holy One, blessed be He. ‘Behold we are your slaves,’ you have not forgotten, but ‘I am the Lord your God,’ which was stated in the Decalogue, you have forgotten, for you have erected two calves, one in Bethel and one in Dan. And according to the simple meaning of the verse, you say, “I have found power for myself through oppression and deceitful scales.” And I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt. There I distinguished between a droplet [of seed] of a firstborn and a droplet which was not of a firstborn. I also know and exact retribution from deceitful scales made without understanding and from one who hides his weights in salt in order to deceive.
<b>all my toils shall not suffice for my etc.</b> It would have been better for you had you said to yourself: All my money shall not suffice to atone for my iniquity which I have sinned. In this manner Jonathan renders it: The prophet said to them: All your wealth will not remain with you on the day of the retribution of your sins.
<b>shall not suffice</b> Heb. לֹא יִמְצְאוּ, usually translated ‘shall not find.’ They shall not suffice. Comp. (Num. 11:22) “and suffice (וּמָצָא) for them.” But it cannot be explained: כָֹּל-יְגִיעַי, all those who toil to seek my iniquity shall not find any iniquity with me, for, were that the case, it should be spelled יְגֵעַי without a “yud,” and it should be vowelized with a “tseireh,” but now it is not an expression of one who toils but an expression of toil.

<b>when he became guilty through Baal</b> As soon as he assumed greatness and became guilty with Baal.
<b>he died</b> i.e., Jeroboam’s dynasty was terminated, and so was Ahab’s dynasty. Jonathan renders: When one of the house of Ephraim would speak, fear would seize the nations. They were great among Israel, but when they sinned by worshipping idols, they were slain.

<b>Those who sacrifice man may kiss the calves</b> The priests of Molech say to Israel, “Whoever sacrifices his son to the idol is worthy of kissing the calf” for he has offered him a precious gift. So did our Sages explain this in Sanhedrin (63b), and it fits the wording of the verse better than Jonathan’s translation.

<b>I knew you</b> I set My heart to know your necessity, and I provided you.
<b>deprivation</b> Heb. תַלְאוּבֹת. There is no similarity to this in Scripture, and its interpretation is, according to the context, תֵּל, a heap, שֶאוֹבִין, where they long for all good and do not find it.
@6
<b>When they grazed</b> When they entered the land of their pasture and they were sated, then...
<b>they were sated and their heart became haughty</b> (Ex. 7:20) “And he lifted (וַיָרֶם) the staff,” is an expression of lifting something else. “Became haughty (וַיָרָם)” here means that he himself was lifted.
@7
<b>by the way I will lurk</b> Heb. אָשּׁוּר. Every instance of אָשּׁוּר in Scripture is punctuated with a “dagesh,” but this one is “weak,” since it is not a place name but it means, “I will lurk and ambush.” Comp. (Num. 24:17) “I see him (אֲשּׁוּרֶנוּ) but not near.”
@8
<b>as a bereaving bear</b> Heb. שַׁכּוּל. Like שּׁוֹכֵל, as you say חָנּוּן, gracious, and רַחוּם, merciful, so שַּׁכּוּל, i.e., entirely attired with bereavements and ready to bereave people.
<b>and I will rend the enclosure of their heart</b> like the habit of the bear, which holds its nails on the chest and rends until the heart. Another explanation:
<b>the enclosure of the heart</b> Their heart which is closed from understanding to return to Me.
@9
<b>You have destroyed yourself, O Israel</b> Heb. שִּׁחֶתְךָ.
<b>for against Me</b> you have rebelled: you have rebelled against your help. This is an ellipsis, but [to] one who understands the language of the Scriptures, it makes sense. For against Me was the rebellion which you rebelled, and if you ask, “What does it mean to You?” Against your help you rebelled when you rebelled against Me.
@10
<b>I will be, where is your king?</b> Heb. אֱהִי מַלְכְּךָ אֵפוֹא. Jonathan renders: Where is your king? But I say that it is unnecessary to interpret it other than its apparent meaning.

<b>I will decree...upon you</b> Heb. קָטָבְךָ. I will decree upon you the decree of the grave.
<b>Remorse shall be hidden from My eyes</b> Heb. נֹחַם. I will not regret this evil. נֹחֵם is an expression of regret (נִחוּם), and the “mem” is a radical like the “mem” of נֹעַם, pleasantness, for the accent is on the first syllable, and the “heth” is vowelized with a “pattah.” Were it an expression of resting (נָח), with the “mem” serving as a suffix denoting the plural, the accent would be under the “heth,” and it would be vowelized with a “kamatz” [like כֹּחָם their strength; רוּחָם, their spirit.]
@15
<b>For though he flourish among the marshes</b> Heb. כִּי הוּא בֵּין אַחִים יַפְרִיא. Jonathan renders: For they are called sons, but they increased corrupt deeds. אַחִים An expression of an evil thing. Comp. (Ezekiel 21:20) “Woe! (אָח) It is made for a blade.” Also (ibid. 6:11) “And say, ‘Woe!’ (אָח) to all the... abominations.” יַפְרִיא An expression similar to (Deut. 29:17) פֹּרֶה רֹאשׁ וְלַעֲנָה, that hears (פֹּרַה) hemlock and wormwood.” But I say that אַחִים is an expression similar to (Gen. 41:2) “And they grazed in the marsh (בָּאָחוּ).”
<b>For though he flourish among the marshes</b> Heb. יַפְרִיא. Blossoms and grows in the marsh. Among the marshes, among those growing in the marshes, which always flourish. And, since He compares him to a marsh, He says: An east wind shall come... and his spring shall dry up. Another explanation: For he decreased among the brothers, i.e., Jeroboam. He was a son who decreased the brotherhood [other versions: the heritage] of Israel. Through him, they were divided into two kingdoms. Decreased יַפְרִיע. An expression similar to (Gen. 16:12) “One who decreases men (פֶּרֶא אָדָם) .”

<b>Return, O Israel</b> You, who are in the land of Judah, lest what happens to Samaria happens to you. Therefore, the topics are juxtaposed.

He said to them, “Take for yourselves days (sic); otherwise, I will do to you as I have done to such-and-such a province and to its allies, and to such-and-such a prefecture and to its allies.” Therefore it says, “Samaria shall be accounted guilty,” and then Scripture says: “Return, O Israel.” As is found in Sifrei in the section commencing. (Num. 25:1), “And Israel abode in Shittim.”

<b>and teach [us the] good [way]</b> Heb. וְקַח-טוֹב. And teach us the good way. Another explanation: The few good deeds in our hands take in Your hand and judge us accordingly.

<b>nor will we say any longer</b> to the work of our hands that they are our gods.

@5
<b>I will remedy their backsliding</b> Said the prophet: So has the Holy Spirit said to me.

@9
<b>In the city they clatter</b> Heb. יָשֹׁקּוּ. This is an expression of making a din. Cf. (Isa. 33:4) “like the roaring (כְּמַשַּׁק) of the cisterns”; (Prov. 28: 15) “A growling (שּׁוֹקֵק) bear”; (Zeph. 2:9) “the clattering of (מִמְשַׁק) the thorns.” <i>Jonathan</i>, however, renders it as an expression of arms (נֶשֶק). They are armed.

<b>And the Lord was zealous for His land</b> Heb. וַיְקַנֵּא, an expression similar to (Num. 11:29) “Are you zealous (הַמְקַנֵּא) for me?” Their distress entered His heart, and He fought their battle and engaged in their necessities. Our Sages explain it as an expression of warning. He warned the locusts concerning His land. [from <i>Sotah</i> 3a]
@19
<b>derision</b> Heb. חֶרְפָּה, a derision, that they will call you ill-provided.
@20
<b>And the northerner</b> Heb. הַצְּפוֹנִי. This can be interpreted as referring to the host of locusts, upon which the expression, “and I will drive him to a land barren and desolate,” fits aptly. Another explanation: The people that come from the north, viz., the kings of Assyria. And our Sages (<i>Sukkah </i>52a) state: This is the temptation, which is hidden (צָפוּן) in a person’s heart.
<b>the western sea</b> the eastern sea. And our Sages, who interpreted it [i.e., הַצְּפוֹנִי] as a reference to temptation, interpreted these two seas as the First Temple and the Second Temple. I.e, they explain הַקַּדְמוֹנִי as first and הָאַחֲרוֹן as last. And so they explained it: Because he directed his face toward the First Temple and the Second Temple and destroyed them. [God says: I will drive him out to a land barren and desolate, where he will find no one to incite. That will be because he set his sights for the First Temple and for the Second Temple and, because he incited the people to sin, they were destroyed. The two Temples, where everyone would gather during the three Pilgrimage Festivals, are symbolized by the sea, where water of the streams gather.] And, according to the <i>Targum</i>, who explains it as a reference to the king of Assyria, we must explain “his face to the eastern sea, and his end to the western sea” to mean that part of his army I will send to the east and part of it to the west.
<b>its ill savor</b> Heb. צַחֲנָתוֹ. The word בָאְשוֹ, its stench, indicates concerning that it is an expression of filth.

<b>in the first month</b> -In Nissan. Although the early rain is the first rain, which falls on the seeds, and that is in Marcheshvan, that year they sowed in Nissan, as is explained in Tractate <i>Taanith</i> (5a) that the grain grew in eleven days.

<b>and your pruning hooks</b> Heb. וּמַזְמ ְרוֹתֵיכֶם, serpes in French.
@11
<b>Gather</b> Heb. עוּשׁוּ. Like חוּשוּ, hasten, so did Menahem associate it. <i>Jonathan</i>, however, renders: they shall gather, and I say that it is an expression of a block of iron (עֶשֶת), which is gathered together, masse in French, and the “tav” is not a radical.
<b>there the Lord shall break your mighty men</b> Heb. הַנְחַת. There in the gathering of the Valley of Jehoshaphat, He will break your might. So did <i>Jonathan </i>render it, but I do not know whether it is an Aramaic expression of lowering (נחת) or an expression of breaking (חתת), and the “nun” is defective. Cf. (Dan. 2:25) “brought Daniel in (הנְעַל) before the king,” which has no radical but על.
@13
<b>Stretch out a sickle etc.</b> -Draw the swords, you who go on My mission to destroy the nations.
<b>for the harvest is ripe</b> -I.e, for their time has arrived, and he compared the matter to harvest, which is harvested with sickles when it becomes completely ripe.

<b>press</b> Heb. רְדוּ, an expression of pressing [or ruling]. Cf. (Gen. 1:28) “And rule (וּרְדוּ) over the fish of the sea.”
<b>and the vats shall roar</b> - The sound of the stream of the wine going down in the vats before the winepresses is heard.
@14
<b>in the valley of decision</b> -For there it is decided that the judgment is true. And so did <i>Jonathan </i>render: the valley of judgment.

@19
<b>Egypt etc. and Edom</b> -He juxtaposed them as regards their retribution. You find that, were it not for Egypt, Edom would not exist, as it is stated: (I Kings 11:16 21) “For Joab and all Israel remained [stationed] there for six months etc. every male in Edom.” And it is stated there: (verse 17) “Adad fled, he and some Edomite men etc. And Hadad pleased Pharaoh very much etc. And Hadad etc. that David slept with his fathers etc.” And, at the end, (verse 25) “And he was an adversary to Solomon (sic).” Said the Holy One, blessed be He: I will destroy both of them.
<b>because of the violence done to the children of Judah</b> -Because of the violence they did to the children of Judah, viz., that they shed their blood.
@21
<b>Now should I cleanse, their blood I will not cleanse</b> -Even if I cleanse them of other sins in their hands, and of the evils they have done to Me, I will not cleanse them of the blood of the children of Judah. When will this come to pass? At the time the Holy One, blessed be He, dwells in Zion.

<b>two years before the earthquake</b> -Two years before Uzziah was plagued, the day Isaiah prophesied, as it is stated: (Isaiah 6: 4) “And the doorposts quaked,” and it is stated: (Zechariah 14:5) “As you fled before the earthquake.”

<b>and the dwellings of the shepherds shall be cut off</b> - <i>Jonathan</i> renders: And the dwellings of the kings shall become desolate, and the strength of their walled cities shall be destroyed.
@3
<b>For three transgressions of etc.</b> -As it is stated (Job 33:29) “Lo, all these things does God work, twice, yea, thrice, with a man.” But He does not forgive more (according to Shem Ephraim). And here, it is as follows: I have already behaved toward them according to My standard, to forgive them for three transgressions, and if there are more, surely the smaller number is included in the larger amount.
<b>yea for four I will not return them</b> -For the fourth transgression, I need no longer return him empty- handed from taking his recompense from Me, and surely since there are many transgressions in their hands; now I will visit upon them the retribution for threshing the inhabitants of Gilead, their neighbors.
<b>with sledges of iron</b> - <i>Jonathan</i> renders: <i>morigin</i> of iron. Now that is a sort of file called ‘lime,’ which is made with numerous grooves, and with which they chastise people with tortures, and with them they cut the stubble of the grain to make straw.
@4
<b>Hazael etc. Ben Hadad</b> -The kings of Aram, and the head of Aram is Damascus.
@5
<b>from Bik’ath-Aven</b> -That is a place in Aram.
<b>and one who holds the scepter</b> -[<i>Jonathan</i> renders:] and one who exercises sovereignty. Cf. (Gen. 49:10) “The scepter shall not turn away from Judah,” since the ruler castigates the people with sticks.
<b>from Beth-Eden</b> -A place name.
<b>to Kir</b> -A place name, where Sennacherib exiled them during the time of Ahaz, as it is stated: “And he went up to Damascus and seized it, and exiled Aram to Kir.” [see II Kings 16:9, where the wording differs.] All the retribution that the prophets of Israel prophesied concerning the nations - the prophets who preceded Sennacherib, e.g. Isaiah and Amos, prophesied concerning the sword of Sennacherib, and Jeremiah and Ezekiel prophesied concerning the sword of Nebuchadnezzar.
@6
<b>Gaza</b> -That was a city of the Philistines.
<b>a whole captivity</b> -I.e, the captivity of Israel, that the captivity be complete, that no one should escape, for they would stand on the roads and seize those fleeing and deliver them. And so did the people of Tyre, and so to the four sides during the destruction of the Second Temple, as is delineated in the Aggadah of Ha’azinu (<i>Sifre</i> 322), Gaza from the south, Tyre from the north, Damascus from the east, the Arabs from the west, as it is stated: (Isaiah 21: 13) “The harsh prophecy concerning Arabia: In the forest in Arabia did you lodge, on the roads of your cousins.”
@8
<b>Ashdod... Ashkelon... Ekron</b> -They were the lords of the Philistines.
<b>and I will return My hand</b> -I will smite them repeatedly.
@9
<b>and did not remember the brotherly covenant</b> -which existed between Hiram and Solomon, as it is said: (I Kings 5:26) “And they both made a league together.” And they called each other brothers, as it is said: (ibid. 9:13) “And he said: ‘What are these cities that you have given me, my brother?’”
@11
<b>for pursuing their brother with a sword</b> -As it is said: (Num. 20:18) “Lest I go forth against you with the sword.” And he still clings to his anger, keeps his wrath, and has not retracted it.
<b>and grasped forever their anger</b> -He clung to it and did not let it go.
@12
<b>the palaces of Bozrah</b> -It is between Moab and Edom, and it belonged to the land of Moab, but it was attracted to Edom. And it set up a king for them when the first king died, and it is said: (Gen. 36: 33) “Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah.” [from <i>Gen. Rabbah 83:3]</i>
@13
<b>they ripped up the pregnant woman of Gilead</b> -They destroyed it and also ripped up their pregnant women so that no heir would remain who would contest the inheritance. And so does Scripture state: (Jer. 49:1) “Concerning the children of Ammon. So said the Lord: Has Israel no sons? Has he no heir? Why has Malcam taken possession of Gad?”
#2
@1
<b>For he burnt the bones etc.</b> -Once the king of Edom fell into the hands of the king of Moab, and they burned his bones and plastered them on the walls of the house, and the Holy One, blessed be He, requited the injustice inflicted upon the king, for they treated him with disgrace.

<b>and a poor man in order to lock [the fields]</b> Heb. נַעֲלָיִם. <i>Jonathan</i> renders in two places [here and below 8:6]: in order to inherit. And I say that this is its explanation. They pervert the judgment of the poor man so that he will be compelled to sell his field that he had between the fields of the judges, and this one seeks an opportunity and takes it for a cheap price in order to fence in and lock all his fields together, and it should not intervene between them.
@7
<b>Who aspire on the dust of the earth</b> -On the dust of the earth, when they walk on it, all their aspiration and all their thoughts are concerning the head of the poor, how they will rob them and take their property. שְׁ אִיפָה is <i>goloser</i> in O.F., aspiring.

<b>to the maid</b> -I.e, a betrothed maid.

<b>And they recline on pledged garments</b> - <i>Jonathan</i> renders: On couches of a pledge they dine. They settle [the charge as] a loan upon the poor. and they take a pledge from them, and make their garments into couches and recline on them at the time of their meal.

<b>in the house of their god</b> - In the house of the idol that they had beside the altar.
@9

<b>and his roots from below</b> -I. e, the earthly princes. Another explanation: the wasp would blind their eyes from above and castrate them from below. [from <i>Sotah</i> 36a]
@11
<b>as Nazirites</b> - <i>Jonathan</i> renders: as teachers. For they were separated from the ways of the people of the land and were engaged in the Torah. The expression נְזִירָה is everywhere only an expression of separation.
<b>Is this not so?</b> -This is a rhetorical question. I.e, can you deny this?
@12
<b>And you gave the Nazirites to drink wine</b> -lest they instruct you, for a drunken man is forbidden to instruct.
<b>And you gave the Nazirites to drink wine</b> - <i>Jonathan</i> renders: And you misled your teachers with wine.
<b>“Do not prophesy.”</b> -Amaziah the priest of Bethel commanded Amos in this manner: (Amos 7:12) “Seer, go, flee to the land of Judah.”

<b>Behold I will oppress</b> Heb. מֵעִיק, the Aramaic translation of מֵצִיק,

@3
<b>Will two walk together</b> -Concerning what you say to the prophets, “Do not prophesy,” do the prophets prophesy from their own mind unless they were commanded? Are things done in any way but in their customary fashion?
<b>unless they agree</b> -Unless they made an appointment to go together to such and such a place.
@4
<b>Will a lion roar in the forest if he has no prey</b> -When a lion lays hold of its prey, it customarily roars, and it does not roar unless it has taken [prey]. Similarly, Scripture states: (Isa. 5:29) “He will roar like the lion cubs, and he will growl and lay hold of prey.” Similarly, (ibid. 31:4) “As a lion or a young lion growls over his prey.”
@5
<b>Will a bird fall on a net upon the ground unless it has a snare</b> -in the net which has fallen upon it?
<b>Will a net ascend from the ground</b> -from the place it was laid unless a bird was caught in it? When it wishes to escape, it pulls up the net and lifts it from its place a little, and at that time it is caught.
@6
<b>Will a shophar be sounded</b> -For the lookout sees troops approaching the city and sounds the shophar to warn the people. These are but words of allegory and similitude, [to be explained as follows:]
<b>[4] Will a lion roar</b> -That is Nebuchadnezzar. Another explanation: The prophets compare the holy spirit that comes upon them from the roar of a lion, as he states below: (verse 8) “A lion has roared; who will not fear?” And here he explains the allegory. Did the Holy One, blessed be He, bring the holy spirit into the mouths of the prophets to [prophesy] evil unless retribution was decreed by Him? That is the prey. Will the Holy One, blessed be He, let out a cry to speak harshly unless He has taken you with the snare of iniquity? Will a bird fall on a net that the net will not snare it? I.e, is it possible that you commit sins and it will not be a snare to you? Will a net ascend etc.? Similarly, will your iniquities ascend on high and not take you? Will a shophar be sounded in the city?... So should you quake before the words of the prophets who look out for you to deliver you from the evil, that it not come, and when the evil comes to you, should you not know that the Holy One, blessed be He, does it to you because you did not take heed of His prophets?

<b>in the corner of a bed or in the corner of a couch</b> Heb. בִּפְאַת מִטָּה וּבִדְמֶשֶׁק עֶרֶשׂ. <i>Jonathan</i> renders: with the strength of rule and trusting in Damascus. I say that the interpretation of the <i>Targum</i> is as follows: Since, in the days of Jehoahaz son of Jehu it is written. (II Kings 13:7) “For the king of Aram had destroyed them,” and Jeroboam his grandson saved them partially, as it is said. (ibid. 14:27) “And the Lord did not speak to eradicate the name of Israel from under the heavens, and He saved them through Jeroboam the son of Joash.” (ibid. verse 25) “He restored the boundary of Israel.” And that is the meaning of ‘in the corner of a bed.’ The corner of a house is the strongest part of the house. Therefore, he translates. ‘with the strength of rule’ of Jeroboam, and Amos prophesied in the days of Jeroboam. He further prophesied that they would eventually rely on the kings of Aram, and so they did in the days of Pekah son of Remaliah. This is the meaning of וּבִדְמֶשֶׁק עֶרֶשׂ, and their couch will be Damascus. Their rest and trust will be on Damascus. And our Sages said in <i>Seder Olam</i> (ch. 22) Rabbi Nehorai said in the name of Rabbi Joshua: These are the ten tribes, which relied on Hezekiah, and on Judah, and escaped with them.
<b>in the corner of a bed</b> -This teaches us that only one eighth of them was left. And the rest of the couch -where was it? In Damascus, to fulfill what is stated: (below 5:27) “And I will exile you beyond Damascus.” And I heard in the name of Rabbi Menahem of blessed memory, that he explained. This is one eighth, since it is not stated. “the corner of;” but “in the corner of a bed,” in part of it, in one of the two ends of a corner. That is an eighth of the bed, for it has four corners, and two ends of each corner. [This is Rabbi Menahem’s explanation of <i>Seder Olam</i> ch. 22. This is probably Rabbi Menahem ben Helbo, the author of <i>Pithronim</i>.] Another explanation I found in the words of Rabbi Meir of blessed memory, as follows:
<b>In the corner of a bed</b> -Because of the sin of Ahaziah son of Ahab, who sent to inquire “of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this illness” (I Kings 1:2).
<b>and in Damascus is the couch</b> -Ben-hadad, king of Aram, sent to inquire of the God of Israel (ibid. ch. 8).

<b>your posterity</b> Heb. וְאַחֲרִיתְכֶן, lit., your end. Dunash ben Livrat (<i>Teshuvoth</i> p. 50): We find a person’s descendants called ‘his end.’ Cf. (Daniel 11:4) “And when he stands up, his kingdom shall be broken, and it shall be divided to the four winds of the heaven, and not to his posterity (לְאַחֲרִיתוֹ).” I.e, he will not leave over his kingdom to his son.

<b>And [through the] breaches they shall emerge, each woman straight before her</b> -And in the breaches of the wall they shall emerge there to flee.

<b>and you shall cast off the haughtiness</b> Heb. הַהַרְמוֹנָה. And you shall cast off yourselves the haughtiness and the authority that you took. This is an Aramaism in the Talmud: (<i>Baba Mezia</i> 84) “הַרְ מָנָה דְמַ לְכָּא, It is the king’s command.” And <i>Jonathan</i> renders: “And they shall exile you beyond the טורֵי חַרְ מִינֵי”. They are the mountains of darkness, an expression of destruction (חֵרֶם) and waste.

<b>Come to Bethel etc.</b> -Like a man who says to a scoundrel, “Do [as you please] until your measure [of sin] is full.”
<b>and bring your sacrifices in the morning</b> -The priests of Baal say to them, “Idolatry is liberal and does not impose stringent regulations upon you. The Torah states: (Exodus 34:25) ‘Shall not stay overnight,’ but for idolatry, ‘And bring in the morning. ’ The Torah states concerning sacrifices of lesser sanctity: (Lev. 19:6) ‘On the day of your sacrifice, it may be eaten, and on the morrow, ’ but idolatry, ‘after three days your tithes of cattle.’ The Torah states: (Lev. 2: 11) ‘Leaven... you shall not offer up,’ but idolatry, (verse 5) ‘And offer up a thanksgiving offering of leaven. ’ The Torah states: (Deut. 23:22) ‘You shall not delay its payment,’ but idolatry, ‘and proclaim and publish the free will offerings.’ Proclaim: ‘Whoever vowed and forgot, shall give it thought and remember.’” (<i>Yerushalemi, Avodah Zarah</i> 1:1) And <i>Jonathan</i> renders: And offer up from robbery. Cf. (Isa. 1: 17) “Strengthen the robbed (חָמוֹץ);” (Psalms 71:3) “From the hand of the unrighteous and the robbers (וּמְ חַמֵּץ).”

@5
<b>But seek not Bethel etc. nor pass Beersheba</b> -Here it does not say, “You shall not come,” or “You shall not seek,” but, “You shall not pass.” This teaches us that there was no idol worship there, but as long as one of the members of the ten tribes would go out to seek and did not yet pass Beersheba, he could still turn to the Temple, to Jerusalem, and once he passed Beersheba, that is the way to the calf in Bethel or to the calf in Dan. And so Scripture states: (infra 8:14) “As your god, O Dan, lives, and as the way of Beersheba lives.” And you should know [that this is so], for Scripture pronounced decrees of retribution on Gilgal and Bethel, and did not decree upon Beersheba.
<b>for Gilgal shall be exiled</b> - According to its name is its curse. And, similarly, there is a city near Bethel named Beth-aven in the Book of Joshua (7:2).
<b>shall become nought</b> Heb. לְאָוֶן. [<i>Jonathan</i> renders:] לִלְמָא, which is the Aramaic translation of הֶבֶל, vanity, and this is a similarity to (Hosea 12: 12) “If Gilead is nought, it is because they are but futility.”

<b>He Who calls the water of the sea</b> - <i>Jonathan</i> renders: He Who said to gather camps as numerous as the water of the sea, and scatter them upon the face of the earth. And our Sages explained it as a reference to the generation of Enosh, when He caused the water of the ocean to inundate them. [from <i>Mid. Psalms</i> 88:2, <i>Gen. Rabbah</i> 23:7]

<b>and the burden of grain you take</b> -The settling of the balance as a loan, that you raised the market price for them immediately to sell them grain with interest, in order to take their estate from them. Therefore, houses and vineyards that you have built and planted on those estates shall not remain in your hands.

I said: (Lev. 1: 2) “Should a man sacrifice,” when he wishes to sacrifice. And Scripture states: (Num. 9:2) “And the children of Israel shall make the Passover sacrifice in its time.” This tells us that Israel made only that Passover sacrifice.

<b>and the Sabbatical Year, so that we will open grain</b> -When will the Sabbatical Year come, and the grain will become expensive, and we will open our storehouses of grain.

<b>Shall the land not quake for this</b> -Is this iniquity not serious enough that the land be destroyed because of it?
<b>Yea, it shall rise up wholly like the rain cloud</b> Heb. כָּאֹר. And in another place (9:5), Scripture says: “And it shall come up wholly like the river (כַיְאֹר),” and <i>Jonathan</i> renders them both identically: And a king shall rise upon it with his camp as numerous as the waters of the river, and cover it completely. To me, it seems difficult to define כָאֹר like כַיְאֹר. It can, however be explained like: (Job 36:32) “On the clouds, the rain (אוֹר) is covered. (Job 37:11)” He scatters his rain cloud (אוֹרוֹ) .” And it shall go up wholly like a rain cloud, pitch darkness.
<b>and it shall overflow and sink like the river of Egypt</b> -The Nile overflows once in forty years and waters the land, and when it overflows, it brings up mud and dirt on its banks, and when it returns from watering, it returns over its banks and its water sinks. And that is called sinking, for the dirt that makes the water murky, settles.
<b>and it shall cast up</b> Heb. וְנִגְרְשָׁה, Like (Isa. 57:20) “And its waters cast up (וַ ִיּגְרְשׁוּ) mud and dirt.” Also the land will spew out the wicked in its midst, and afterwards it will rest.

And the sideposts shall quake, meaning that the Temple will be destroyed, and the Courtyards will be demolished. וּבְצַעַם בְּרֹאשׁ כֻּלָם, meaning that the vessels of the Temple will go into captivity. וּבְצַעַם means ‘their money’ shall go into exile at the head of all of them.

So will you be able to improve.”

The Philistines, too, I took out of Caphtor in such a manner when the Caphtorites came upon the Avvites, as the matter is stated (Deut. 2:23) “And the Avvites who lived in open towns up to Gaza etc.” They vanquished also the people of Gaza and the remaining lords of the Philistines under them, and I took them out of their hands, and, even so, I did not make them My people.

Our Sages of blessed memory stated: Obadiah was an Edomite proselyte. Said the Holy One, blessed be He: From them and in them will I bring upon them. Let Obadiah, who dwelt between two wicked people, Ahab and Jezebel, and did not learn from their deeds, come and impose retribution upon Esau, who dwelt between two righteous people, Isaac and Rebecca, and did not learn from their deeds.

<b>to flee to Tarshish</b> -I.e, to a sea named Tarshish, which is outside the Holy Land. He said, “I will flee to the sea, for the Shechinah does not rest outside the Holy Land.” Said the Holy One, blessed be He, to him, “By your life, I have messengers like you to send after you and fetch you from there.” This is illustrated by an allegory of a priest’s slave who fled from his master and entered a cemetery [making it impossible for his master to retrieve him]. His master said to him, “I have slaves like you to send after you and fetch you from there.” Now what did Jonah see that he did not wish to go to Nineveh? He said, “The gentiles are quick to repent. Should I prophesy to them and they repent, I will be found condemning Israel, who do not heed the words of the prophets.” [from <i>Mechilta</i>, Exodus 12:1]

Therefore, it is stated וַיְמַן, the letters מָן י"ו sixteen [days of] manna. Similarly, וַיְמַן קיקָיוֹן, and He appointed a kikayon, for he ate four omers; therefore, it says four times וַיְמַן (4:6 ff.).

(Ps. 76:6) “The stout-hearted have become mad (אֱשְׁתּוֹלְלוּ)”; (Isa. 59:15) “And he who turns away from evil is considered mad (מִשְׁתּוֹלֵל).” The ‘tav’ comes into the word to serve in the reflexive present and past. This is the normal pattern of a word whose first radical letter is ‘shin’ or ‘sammech’ when a ‘tav’ is added in the reflexive, either present or past, as in מִשְׁתּוֹלֵל. I say that it is an expression of error, as in (II Kings 4:28) “Do not mislead (תַשְׁלֶה) me”; (II Sam. 6:7) “For his error (הַשַּׁל) ;” (Dan. 3: 29) “who speaks anything amiss (שָׁלוּ).”

<b>Do not declare it in Gath</b> -lest the Philistines rejoice about us.
<b>in the houses of Aphrah</b> -This is Ophrah of the Abiezrites (Jud. 6:11).
<b>wallow in the dust</b> Heb. הִתְפַּלָּשִׁי, a play on words with the name Philistia (פְּלֶשֶת). Similarly, (verse 11) “You inhabitant of Shafir, with your private parts exposed.” Similarly, (verse 11) “The inhabitant of Zanaan has not gone forth.” In all of these, the language of the lamentation is according to the name of the city.
<b>wallow</b> Heb. הִתְפַּלָּשִׁי, roll. According to the context, cover yourself with dust.
@11
<b>Pass along your way</b> Heb. עִבְרִי לָכֶם. He commences with an expression in the feminine singular, as used in addressing the people of the city, as it is said: “the inhabitant of Shafir” addressing them all in the name of one people. And then he says, “לָכֶם, along your way” as used in addressing many people, for he was speaking to the public.
<b>the inhabitant of Shafir</b> -Shafir is the name of the city.
<b>with your private parts exposed</b> -Private parts would be exposed, appropriate to a city called “Shafir,” the name of the aborted fetus that comes out of the woman’s womb.
<b>the inhabitants of Zaanan did not go forth</b> -The fugitives of the inhabitants of Zaanan shall not go forth. -[from <i>Jonathan</i>]
<b>the lamentation caused by drawing the houses one to the other shall take its stand from you</b> -The lamentation you caused those who were robbed, whom you robbed of their inheritance in order to draw one house to the other, one field to the other, will take its stand from you - the stand of the houses that you built and erected on their inheritance.
<b>by drawing the houses from one the other</b> ajoustement in Old French [which means, adding or joining].
@12
<b>For the one dwelling in disobedience hoped for good</b> -For the one dwelling in tranquility and disobeying the word of the prophets hoped for good.
<b>but evil descended</b> Heb. כִּי. This instance of כִּי serves as an expression of “but.” She hoped for good, but, because of her disobedience, evil descended to her.
@13
<b>Hitch the chariot to the swift steeds</b> Heb. רְתֹם הַמֶּרְכָּבָה לַרֶכֶשׁ. Hitch the chariot to the רֶכֶשׁ, which is swift to run, and you shall escape. The word רֶכֶשׁ is explained by Dunash (<i>Teshuvoth Dunash</i> p. 69) as an Arabic word.
@14
<b>Since you give expulsions to the dynasty that gave you the possession of Gath</b> -Since you give expulsions to the kingdom of David, which gave you the possession of Gath, as the matter is stated (I Chron. 18:1): “And he took Gath and its cities out of the hands of the Philistines.” But you reject it, as it is stated (Isa. 8:6): “Since this people has rejected the waters of the Shiloah that flow gently, etc.” Therefore, “the houses of Achzib” which was of the land of Judah and was drawn after Pekah the son of Remaliah, shall ultimately be a “dried up spring” to the kings of Israel - for Pekah the son of Remaliah will be assassinated, and all those who relied on him will be disappointed. This prophecy was prophesied during Ahaz’s reign.
<b>since you give expulsions</b> Heb. לָכֵן. The definition of לָכֵן is עַ ל אֲשֶׁר, because of. Cf. (Isa. 17:10) “Because (עַל כֵּן) I planted you with pleasant saplings,” and you turned into a branch of a stranger.
<b>the houses of Achzib shall be a dried up spring</b> Heb. לְאַכְזָב. This [too] is a play on words לְאַכְזָבת אַכְזִיב. I learned the midrash of this verse from the Aggadah of the chapter “<i>Chelek</i>.” [from <i>Sanh.</i> 102a]
@15
<b>I will yet bring the possessor to you</b> -The enemies, who will possess you, you who dwell in Mareshah. The possessor (הַיוֹרֵש) to Mareshah (מָרֵשָה) -another play on words.
<b>up to Adullam</b> -(which is within the border) will the glory of Israel retreat and come, for the enemies shall conquer from their border up to Adullam. So did <i>Jonathan</i> render: Until Adullam shall they go up and enter the border of the land of Israel. And I heard a Midrash Aggadah in the name of Rabbi Menachem:
<b>I will yet bring the heir</b> -The children of Elam were fit to inherit the land of Israel - for he [Elam] was the firstborn of the sons of Shem - but because of love for your forefathers I transferred it to the children of Arphachshad. Now I will bring the Chaldeans and the Elamites upon them.

<b>and he shall lament, “A lamentation has come about…”</b> Heb. וְנָהָה נְהִ י נִהְיָה. וְנָהָה is a future tense, like וְעָשָה, and he shall make, and וּפָנָה, and he shall turn. The lamenting one shall lament and say, “A lamentation has come about in the world. Now what is the lamentation that has come about?...”
<b>They have robbed us!</b> Heb. שָׁדוֹד נְשַׁדֻּנוּ. Our enemies have robbed us, The prophet uses the expression נְשַׁדֻּנוּ, in which there is a “nun” in the beginning, and does not use שַׁדוּנוּ, because נְשַׁדֻּנוּ serves in two voices, the passive voice and the active voice. Had the prophet written נְשַדֹנוּ, in the passive voice, the expression would refer to the robbed and not to the robbers. Had he written שַדוּנוּ, in the active voice, the expression would refer to the robbers and not to the robbed. This way, it refers to both: we were given into the hand of those who robbed us. In Old French, there is the expression <i>somes degatert nous</i>, we were ravaged. Another explanation: נְשַׁדֻּנוּ means we brought upon ourselves that they robbed us.
<b>He changes the portion of my people</b> -The inheritance of the portion of my people has been exchanged to the enemy.
<b>How will He turn to me to return our fields, which he divides</b> -How will He turn again to me, to return our fields to us, which this enemy divides for himself? How is it possible to return them to me anymore? All these are the words of the lamenting one who takes up the parable.
<b>How will He turn to me</b> - <i>Kome se destornera amois</i>? As in (Jud. 4:18) “Turn to me.... And he turned to her.”

<b>they shall not take shame</b> -Lest disgraces from them overtake them, as the matter is stated (Prov. 9:8): “Reprove not a scorner.” Every instance of טִיף is an expression of prophecy, as in (Amos 7:16) “And do not prophesy (תַטִיף) concerning the house of Isaac” and (Ezek. 21:2) “And prophesy (וְהַטֵף) to the south.”
@7
<b>Is that what is said by the house of Jacob?</b> -Do (the people of) the house of Jacob say this when they hear the evil that my prophets prophesy for them?
<b>Has the Lord’s patience grown short?</b> -Is He now unable to do good, or does He not (now) have the patience that He had in the early days to do good?
<b>Are these His deeds?</b> -I.e., to do evil?
<b>Do not My words benefit the one who goes straight?</b> - I am not impatient, neither are these My deeds, except to the wicked; but with the one who goes straight, I do good.
@8
<b>And the matter for which My people causes [Me] to rise as an enemy</b> -Heb. וְאֶתְמוּל. The verse is connected to the one preceding it. I am good and do good, but the matter for which and because of which My people make me rise as an enemy to them...
<b>because of the garment, and the mantle that you strip</b> -Because you rob the garment, and you strip the glorious raiment from all those who pass you by on the road.
<b>from those who pass by confidently, who return from war</b> -Instead of passing by confidently, as they expected to, they became like men returning from war without clothing or food, for their enemies took everything they had.
<b>who return</b> Heb. שׁוּבִי, as in (Jer. 2:21) “A degenerate (סוּרֵי) wild vine” and (Zeph. 3:18) “Those taken away (נוּגֵי) from the appointed season.”

<b>Arise and go, for this is not the tranquility</b> -Arise and go into exile from the land, for it was not in this manner that I gave it to you for tranquility.
<b>in order to contaminate it, it forms bands, and the band is clarified</b> -In order to contaminate it [the land], it [the people] forms a band of groups of wicked men.
<b>it forms bands</b> Heb. תְּחַבֵּל. This is an expression of companies, as in (I Sam. 10:5) “a band (חֶבֶל) of prophets”; (Ps. 119:61) “Bands of (חֶבְלֵי) wicked men.” And so did <i>Jonathan</i> render: And they band together upon it, an expression of a band.
<b>and the band is clarified</b> Heb. וְחֶבֶל נִמְרָץ. And at the time of their banding together, they already took counsel among themselves and explained for what purpose they were banding together.
<b>clarified</b> Heb. נִמְרָץ. A thing explained clearly, as in (Job 6: 25) “How clear (נִמְרְצוּ) are right words”; (ibid. 16:3) “What clarifies (יַמְרִיצְךָ) to you”; (I Kings 2:8) “A clear (נִמְרֶצֶת) curse.”

<b>shall stir with people</b> -The cities shall be noisy because of the large number of people in their midst.

<b>and broke [them] as in a pot</b> Heb. וּפָרְשׁוּ. They break the limbs as they break the cuts [of meat] in a pot to cook [them].
<b>and broke</b> Heb. וּפָרְשׁוּ, an expression of breaking. Cf. (Isa. 58:7) “To share (פָרֹס) with the hungry”; (Jer. 16:7) “And they shall not break [bread] (יִפְרְסוּ) for them”; (Lam. 1:17) “Zion broke (פֵּרְשָה).”

@6
<b>I will heal the limping one</b> Heb. אֹסְפָה. I will gather in the exiles. So did <i>Jonathan</i> render. To me, however, it appears as an expression of healing, as in (II Kings 5:6) “And you shall cure him (וְאֲסַפְתּוֹ) of his zaraath.”
<b>and those whom I harmed</b> -And those whom I harmed because of their iniquity.
@8
<b>And you, tower of the flock</b> Heb. מִגְדַּל עֵדֶר. <i>Jonathan</i> renders: And you, anointed one of Israel, who is hidden because of the sins of the people of Zion. His explanation is: מִגְדַּל is an expression of a stronghold, and he renders עֵדֶר as the people of Israel. He renders עֹפֶל as an expression of אֹפֶל, darkness. [I.e., מִגְדַּל עֵדֶר is the stronghold of Israel, identified as the Messiah. He is hidden because of the sins of the people of Zion. The word “hidden” is derived from אֹפֶל, darkness.] But it is possible to interpret מִגְדַּל עֵדֶר as the Temple, and עֹפֶל as an expression of a mighty tower. Likewise there is (Isa. 32:14) “Rampart (עֹפֶל) and tower.”
<b>to you it shall come</b> -The remnant of the limping ones and the scattered ones shall gather to you.
<b>and the former kingdom shall come</b> -The complete kingdom, in its entirety, shall come to the house of David in Jerusalem as it was originally, before it was divided. Now what was the former kingdom? The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
@9

@10
<b>Be in pain</b> Heb. חוּלִי, an expression of pain, as in (verse 9) “that pangs (חִיל) have seized you.” This expression is appropriate for a woman in confinement.

<b>With a rod, they strike... on the cheek</b> -Who caused them (Babylon) to succeed? The Israelites deride their prophets and their judges and strike them on the cheek. So were they wont to do, and so we find in <i>Pesikta</i> (<i>d’Rav Kahana</i>, p. 125b), and so does Isaiah say, (Isa. 50:6) “I gave my back to smiters.”

<b>you should have been the lowest of the clans of Judah</b> -You should have been the lowest of the clans of Judah because of the stigma of Ruth the Moabitess in you.

<b>Therefore, He shall deliver them until the time a woman in confinement gives birth</b> -He shall deliver them into the hands of their enemies until the coming of the time that Zion has felt the pangs of labor and borne her children; Zion, which is now seized by the pangs of labor, is now called a woman in confinement. [I.e., now the labor pains will cease and the redempyion will come about.] But our Sages state that from here we deduce that the son of David will not come until the wicked kingdom spreads over the entire world for nine months (<i>Yoma</i> 10b, <i>Sanh.</i> 98b). But, according to its simple meaning, this is the structure as I explained.
<b>and the rest of his brothers</b> -The brothers of the King Messiah; i.e., the rest of the tribe [of Judah].

<b>and to walk discreetly</b> - <i>Jonathan</i> renders: Walk discreetly in the fear of your God. Another explanation: And walk discreetly. The standard of flesh and blood is not like the standard of the Holy One, blessed be He. The standard of flesh and blood is: If one man embarrasses his fellow and comes to placate him, the fellow says to him, “I will not accept your apology until so and so and so and so, before whom you disgraced me, come.” But the Holy One, blessed be He, desires only that the man’s return to Him be between the two of them.

<b>The voice of the Lord calls out in the city</b> -The voice of the prophets of the Lord calling out, calling them [the people] to repentance. [from <i>Jonathan</i>]
<b>and the wisdom of the Torah, the one who sees Your name</b> -The prophet who sees Your name calls out the wisdom of the Torah; i.e., the one who puts his heart to contemplate and to see your ways. The word וְתוּשִׁיּה refers to the verse above it.
<b>hearken to the staff and Who appointed it</b> -Bend your ears, and hearken to the staff of retribution that will punish you, concerning which the prophets warn you; and hearken to who it is Who appointed that retribution, whether He has the ability to fulfill what He decreed. But <i>Jonathan</i> did not render in this manner.
<b>and the wisdom of Torah, the one who sees Your name</b> From here we deduce that whoever recites daily a verse beginning [with the letter] and ending [with the letter] as his name begins and ends, the Torah saves him from Gehinnom.
@10
<b>Does the house of the wicked last long, [or do] the treasures of wickedness?</b> -The “hey” of הַאִשׁ is vowelized with a “pattach” [not a kamatz] because it denotes a question. And this is its meaning: עוֹד is an expression of longevity. הַאִשׁ is like הֲיֵשׁ, is there. In I Chronicles (2:13) we find: “Ishai the father of David,” instead of “Yishai.” Here, too, is אִשׁ instead of יֵשׁ. And so in II Samuel (14:19): “If anyone can (אִשׁ) turn to the right or to the left.” [This is identical to] “If anyone can (יֵשׁ) turn to the right or to the left.” So did <i>Jonathan</i> render it: Is there. Will it enter your mind that the house of the wicked will last long, and the treasures of wickedness?
<b>And an ephah of leanness is condemned</b> -A small measure with which your wealthy deceive the poor and bring them to leanness - that is condemned by the wrath of the Holy One, blessed be He.

<b>and it shall bend you over in your innards</b> Heb. וְיֶשְׁחֲךָ. The food that you eat - I will bring a curse into it within your intestines, and it will cause you illness, that you will be ill and walk bent over. So it is explained in <i>Sifre</i>: How do we know that, even within the intestines? Scripture states: “And it shall bend you over in your innards.” In the parashah of Ekev, in expounding (Deut. 11:12) “The eyes of the Lord your God are upon it,” <i>Jonathan</i>, too, renders [our verse] in this manner: And it shall be to you for illness and a wound in your intestines.
<b>and you shall overtake</b> -your enemies who lead your sons and daughters away, into captivity; but you shall not rescue them, and if you rescue them, their end will be to the sword. In the name of Rabbi Menahem I heard: You shall gain your desire for sexual intercourse, but you shall not ejaculate. You shall not have the strength to ejaculate semen; and, if you do ejaculate them [and beget children], their end will be that I will deliver them to the sword [of the enemy].

These are the last figs, which are inferior. And so did <i>Jonathan</i> render: as the late figs of the summer.

<b>what is in his heart</b> Heb. הַוַּתנַפְשׁוֹ. He speaks what is (הוֶֹה) to his will and to his desire. Cf.(Jer. 15:1) “I have no desire for this people.” And so did <i>Jonathan</i> render: The desires of his heart.
<b>and they weave the web</b> -They made it into a rope of sin amongst the three of them. As the cart ropes, so is the sin, for a rope is braided of three strands. So have I found in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Taanith</i> 2:1): We made it like a web of sins.

@12
<b>It is a day, and he shall come up to you</b> -The prophet says: That day that you deride, saying that it has been nullified and gone away - that day is guarded and preserved, and has not become nullified. The enemy shall come up to you to destroy you.
<b>from Assyria</b> -which is the first of those who harmed us.
<b>and the fortified cities</b> -I.e., and until the fortified cities. And <i>Jonathan</i> renders (as follows): the great dark mountains.

Cause to come true Your word that You promised Jacob (Gen. 28: 15): “For I will not forsake you.”
<b>the loving-kindness of Abraham</b> The reward for the loving- kindness of Abraham, [out of] which he commanded his sons to keep the way of the Lord: to perform righteousness and justice. Therefore, it does not say, “And the loving-kindness,” but “the loving- kindness.” The truth - that you will make come true the promise to Jacob - that will be the payment of the reward for Abraham’s loving-kindness.

<b>The harsh prophecy concerning Nineveh</b> Heb. מַשָׂא. The burden of the cup of the curse [which was] to be given Nineveh to drink.
<b>The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite</b> - חזון is vowelized with a “kamatz” (חָזוֹן) since it is not in the construct state, and it is unlike “חֲזוֹן יִשַׁעְיָהוּ,” the vision of Isaiah, which is vowelized with a “hataf pattah.” This is its meaning: A book of vision has already been written concerning it [Nineveh], the prophecy of Jonah son of Amittai; and now, again, Nahum the Elkoshite prophesied this harsh prophecy over it. Elkosh is the name of his [Nahum’s] city. And so did <i>Jonathan</i> paraphrase: In early times, Jonah son of Amittai prophesied concerning it, and they repented of their sins, and when they continued to sin, Nahum of the house of Elkosh prophesied further concerning them.
<b>the Elkoshite</b> -That city is in the province of Ballynia, which is in the state of Eretz Israel, although it is outside the Holy Land. Proof of the matter is that there is gold, silver, and salt dust near it because the Dead Sea, which is near Eretz Israel, goes there under the earth. In this state they do not crown a king the son of a king [i.e., the throne is not hereditary]; and they are of the seed of Judah. [<i>Sod Mesharim</i>]

<b>The Lord is a jealous and vengeful God</b> -Nahum prophesied concerning Sennacherib’s descendants, and in the time of Manasseh, as we find in <i>Seder Olalm</i> (ch.20).

<b>He is destined to wreak vengeance upon His adversaries</b> who destroyed their land and exiled His people.
<b>and he bears a grudge</b> Heb. וְנוֹטֵר, lit. watches. He lays up His hatred for His enemies. Rabbi Simon says: These three expressions of vengeance correspond to the three exiles to which Sennacherib exiled Israel, as we find in <i>Seder Olam</i> (ch. 23).
@3
<b>The Lord is slow to anger and great in power</b> -He is great in power, and He has the ability to wreak vengeance. The reason He did not hasten His revenge is that He is slow to anger, but, in any case, He will not acquit.
<b>the Lord - His way is with a tempest and with a storm</b> -They [the tempest and storm] are His messengers for wreaking retribution upon His enemies, as it is stated concerning Egypt (Exod. 14:21): “with a mighty east wind”; and concerning the generation of the Flood (Job 4: 9): “From the breath of God they perish.” Concerning Tyre, it is stated (Ezek. 27:26): “The east wind has broken you.”
<b>and cloud is the dust of His feet</b> -That, too, is the way of His vengeance. (Exod. 14: 24) “And the Lord looked over the camp of the Egyptians with a pillar of fire and cloud”; also, (Ezek. 30:18) “As for her, a cloud shall cover her.”

<b>The Lord is good yea, a stronghold</b> -Even when he inflicts retribution upon His enemies, His mercies do not cease to do good to those who fear Him. [This ability is] unlike the trait of [a man of] flesh and blood, who, when he is busy with one thing, is not free to [simultaneously] do another thing, as the matter is stated (Exod. 15:3): “The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is His Name.” [This is] as it is stated in <i>Mechilta</i> (ad loc.)

<b>they are consumed like dry stubble, fully ripe</b> -Whose ripening has become full and complete, and it has dried out.
<b>fully ripe</b> Heb. מָלֵא ; asovir, to be filled, in O.F And so (Exod. 22:28): “Your ripe fruits (מְלֵאָתְךָ)”; (Deut. 22: 9) “The ripe fruit (הַמְלֵאָה) of the seed.”

<b>Though they be at peace and likewise many</b> Jonathan’s <i>Targum</i> is very appropriate to the verse: If they [the people of Nineveh] are at peace in their counsel, that they will all be of one accord; and likewise, if the people of Nineveh, your enemies, are many, O Jerusalem; and likewise, even if they have crossed the Tigris and passed over the Euphrates to besiege it, they will not succeed, for I have afflicted you; I will no longer afflict you. I have heard further (this rendering):
<b>If they are perfect</b> -the people of Nineveh, in their greatness.
<b>and likewise</b> -if they will be still greater and more honored.
<b>and so they shall be cut down and pass away</b> -And so I will cut them down and take them away. This is like (Exod 1:12) “And the more they would afflict them, the more they would multiply.”
<b>and I will no longer afflict you</b> -I will afflict you this time with destruction and annihilation, and I will no longer be involved with you. Our Sages expounded upon this concerning the practice of charity in Tractate <i>Gittin (7a), but it does not fit in with the context.</i>

<b>the chariots are in the fire of torches on the day of his preparation</b> Heb. פְּלָדֹת. On the day that he [Nebuchadnezzar] is prepared to go out in the army, he polishes his iron chariots, but I do not know what פְּלָדֹת means. I say that it is a material that polishes iron well. And some interpret פְּלָדֹת as an expression of a fiery torch (לַפִּיד), by transposing the letters.
<b>and the cypresses are enwrapped</b> - <i>Jonathan</i> renders: And the heads of the [Babylonian] camps are enwrapped in colored garments.
<b>are enwrapped</b> Heb. הַרְעָלוּ, enwrapped. Similar is (Isa. 3:19) “The necklaces and the bracelets and the shawls (הָרְעָלוֹת).” In the language of the Mishnah we learned “shawled (רְעוּלוֹת) Arabian women” in tractate <i>Shabbath</i> (65a).

<b>shall dash about madly</b> -They shall behave madly.
<b>they shall clatter</b> Heb. יִשְׁתַּקְשְׁקוּן. <i>Jonathan </i>renders: The sound of the clattering of their weapons is heard. And that is from the expression (Joel 2: 24) “And the vats shall roar (וְהֵשִׁיקוּ),” and (Isa. 33:4) “Like the roaring (כְּמַשַק) of the cisterns.” It is an expression of making a sound heard.

<b>and the protector is armed</b> Heb. הַסֹּכֵךְ. <i>Jonathan</i> renders: They shall build towers. We can also explain וְהֻכַן הַסֹּכֵךְ: and the king shall be armed with his weapons, as in (Ezek.28:14) “who shelters over a great distance (מִמְשַׁח הַסֹּכֵךְ),” an expression of ruling.

<b>Plunder silver! Plunder gold!</b> -You who come upon Nineveh.
<b>And there is no end</b> -There is no count.
<b>to the treasures</b> Heb. לְתְּכוּנָה, to their treasures. [It is called תְּכוּנָה] because the silver and gold placed in the treasury is placed there with a count, as you say (II Kings 12:12): “The counted (הַמְתֻכּן) money.” [following <i>Jonathan</i>]
<b>to sweep out [Nineveh] of all precious vessels</b> Heb. כָּבֹד, an expression of sweeping, as in (below, 3:15) “You shall be swept out (הִתְכַּבְדִי) like the nibbling locust,” an expression of sweeping the house; escovant, to sweep them out of all their precious vessels. And so did <i>Jonathan</i> render it: All precious vessels have ended. כָּבֹד is like זָכוֹר, to remember, and שָמוֹר, to observe.

<b>where the grown lion and the old lion went</b> -The place where the kings would go and leave their children there, like a lion that dwelt securely.
@13
<b>The grown lion tore enough for his whelps</b> -As <i>Jonathan</i> renders it: The kings would bring much plunder, until there was enough for the members of their households.
<b>and strangled</b> -beasts, for the necessity of his lionesses; i.e., he would increase his treasures for his children (sic).
<b>for his lionesses</b> - for his wives.
<b>and he filled his caves with prey</b> -And they filled their treasuries with plunder.
@14
<b>her chariots</b> -The multiplicity of the chariots therein; <i>caraijedic</i> in O.F. -army of chariots. The additional “hey” converts the language to mean many chariots. Simliarly, there is (Ezek 24:6) “The pot in which there is filth (חֶלְאָתָה),” much filth.

Here, too, the swallowing of their faces; the swallowing, the longing of their faces resembles the east wind, the fiercest of the winds. So did <i>Jonathan</i> render this.

This is an expression of Milo, for in the city of David there was a high mound, and they would battle upon it. Atop the mound was built a tower whose slant was inclined to the sides, and around its base was a low wall to prevent the earth from falling.

Likewise, (Mal. 1:13) “And you sadden it.” And so are many of them [these euphemisms] explained in <i>Sifre</i> (Num. 10:35). According to the emendation of the scribes, this is its explanation: Are you not my God from everlasting, my Holy One? Do not deliver us into their hands to die.

@3
<b>For there shall be another vision for the appointed time</b> A prophet shall yet arise at the end of the years, to whom a vision shall be revealed concerning when the appointed time shall be for the downfall of Babylon and the redemption of Israel.
<b>and He shall speak of the end</b> The speech that He shall say to him concerning the end of Babylon, (Jer. 29:10) “For at the completion of seventy years of Babylon.” וְיָפֵחַ is an expression of speech; and there are many uses of this root with similar meaning in the Book of Proverbs. Since speech is only the wind emanating from the mouth, he [the writer of the Scriptures] calls it פִּיחַ, blowing, and he calls it wind, e.g., (Ps. 33:6) “And with the wind of His mouth all their host.”
<b>and it shall not fail; though it tarry</b> it shall not fail to come, though that appointed time may take long to come.
<b>wait for it for...; it shall not delay</b> at all after the seventy years. This clause can also be explained to mean: though he tarry, meaning the prophet Jeremiah. <i>Jonathan</i> renders: the prophecy is written and explained in the Book of the Torah. He translated כְּתֹב as כָּתוּב. It has already been alluded to in the Torah (Lev. 26:34): “Then shall the land placate [God concerning] its Sabbaths.” Israel sinned by violating seventy Sabbatical Years, in which they did not release the land, and, corresponding to them, they were exiled therefrom for seventy years. And so it is stated in II Chronicles (36:21): “Until the land placated its Sabbaths; all the days it lay waste, it rested to complete seventy years.” And so you find in Ezekiel (4:5): “And I have given you the years of their iniquity according to the number of days, three hundred and ninety days... (verse 6) I gave you a day for a year.” And Scripture says (verse 4): “And you lie on your left side, etc.” You are found saying that Israel provoked God for three hundred and ninety years until the Ten Tribes were exiled, and the tribe of Judah sinned for forty years, and from the time the Ten Tribes were exiled until the destruction of Jerusalem are the twenty-two years of Manasseh. The rest of Manasseh’s years were spent in repentance, for it is stated concerning him (II Kings 21:2f.) “And he did what was evil, etc.,... as Ahab... had made.” Therefore we count Manasseh’s evil years according to the number of Ahab’s years, and he reigned for twenty-two years. With two years of his son Amon’s reign, and eleven of Jehoiakim’s, and eleven of Zedekiah’s, the evil years total forty-six, and this prophecy was said to Ezekiel in the fifth year of Zedekiah. In any case, we find the time of their sinning four hundred and thirty years, for after this prophecy they tarried there six years. [I.e., the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin remained in the land for six more years] In four hundred years, there are eight Jubilee Years, and in every Jubilee cycle there are seven Release Years, making a total of fifty-six Release Years and eight years consecrated as Jubilee Years making all together sixty-four. In thirty-six years there are five Release Years, totaling sixty-nine consecrated years, and this final Jubilee year is also counted in the number, since it was not completed because of their iniquity. And here, this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Habakkuk: A vision is already written in the Torah, but it is sealed. You write and explain on the tablets, for a vision of this appointed time will yet be revealed.
<b>and He shall speak</b> It is an expression [denoting] speech, and there are many similar instances throughout the book of Proverbs. Since speech is merely wind that goes out of the mouth, it is called פיח or רוח, wind, as in (Psalms 33:6) “and with the breath of His mouth, all their host.”
@4
<b>Behold, it is puffed up</b> The soul of the wicked man is always wroth and full of desire, longing to swallow and never satisfied. עֻפְּלָה is an expression of insolence, as in (Num. 14:44) “And they acted insolently (וַיַעְפִּילוּ)”; and (Isa. 32:14) “Rampart (עֹפֶל) and tower.”
<b>his soul is not upright within him</b> His spirit is not satisfied within him, and he does not say, “What I have already acquired is enough.” Therefore, retribution shall come upon him.
<b>but the righteous shall live by his faith</b> Jeconiah the king, whom this wicked man is destined to exile - his righteousness shall stand for him, and on the day this one is cast out of his grave, Evil-merodach shall raise Jehoiachin’s head and place his throne above the thrones of the kings.

That shall cause him to be slain, and the seed of Nebuchadnezzar to be destroyed, for a haughty man is a scorner; he shall not have a dwelling. Neither he nor his dwelling shall remain in existence.

<b>Woe to him who gives his friend to drink</b> In Seder Olam, it [this verse] is expounded regarding Belshazzar, who gave the princes to drink with the vessels of the Temple, because of which they were smitten with zaraath and intoxicated by the wrath of the Holy One, blessed be He. On that night he [Belshazzar] was slain.

Every expression of עָרְלָה is an expression of clogging, like (Jer. 6:10) “Their ear is clogged” and (Ezek 44:7) “Of clogged heart and of uncircumcised flesh.” <i>Jonathan</i> rendered: And become naked, an expression of (ibid. 16:7) “Naked and bare.”

Although <i>Jonathan</i> explains this phrase homiletically as [the nation of] destruction, the nation of the Cherethites is a province of the Philistines; its name is Cherethi. So Scripture states (I Sam. 30:14) regarding Ziklag: “We made a raid upon the south of the Cherethites, etc.” <i>Jonathan</i> translates: on the south of Cherethi.

<b>In the second year of King Darius</b> This was Darius king of Persia, who succeeded Ahasuerus. We find in <i>Midrash Leviticus Rabbah</i> (13:4) that he was Esther’s son. Now, in the days of Cyrus I, Zerubbabel and Joshua the Priest went up from Babylon to Jerusalem with the sanction of Cyrus, as it is said (Ezra 1:3): “Whoever is among you of all His people, etc.” The adversaries of Judah and Benjamin rose up and sent their letters to Cyrus to [have him] ordain that they [Judah and Benjamin] stop the construction of the Temple, which they had commenced; and he gave the order and stopped it. From that day they stopped, as is explained in Ezra (4:24): “Then the work of the house of God was stopped, etc.” It was stopped for the three years that Cyrus reigned, the fourteen years of Ahasuerus, and the first year of Darius his son. In the second year [of Darius] this prophecy was proclaimed to Haggai: to urge them [i.e., Judah and Benjamin] to resume the building, and that they should not fear, for the heathens would not stop them for the Holy One, blessed be He, would grant them success.
@2
<b>This people has said</b> Since their enemies stopped them the first time, they think that I will not fulfill My words that I said, (Dan. 9:2) “According to the completion of seventy years from the destruction of Jerusalem”; and that the time for the House to be rebuilt will never come. Say to them that now the time has come, but the first time was only a remembrance at the completion of the seventy years from the inception of the kingdom of Babylon. And so it was that at the end of seventy years they were remembered for going up by the sanction of Cyrus; but the [time for the] building of the House depended upon [counting from] the destruction of Jerusalem, which took place eighteen years later than [the inception of] the kingdom of Babylon, as the master said (<i>Meg.</i> 11b): “They were exiled in the eighteenth year; they were exiled in the nineteenth year.” Now, the eighteen years are complete.

<b>when one would come to the wine vat</b> That is the pit before the wine press, into which the wine flows.
<b>to draw off fifty press-measures</b> To draw out from [the winevat] fifty measures with which they would measure wine from the winepresses, and the name [of those fifty measures] is purah.
<b>to draw off</b> to draw, as in (Isa. 30:14) “To scoop water from a cistern”; and so (ibid. 47:2) “Draw off the path.”
<b>and there would be twenty</b> Not that more of a curse is sent into the wine than is sent into the grain, but a person [may] err in estimating the measure of the winevat because it is deep, while the heap [of grain] stands before him. In tractate Avoth d’Rabbi Nathan (4:4) we learned a reason why a small measure is not mentioned with regard to wine, while it is mentioned with regard to grain, e.g.. to draw off twenty-five press measures and it was ten. This teaches us that wine is an extra measure for the world, and when the wine suffers, it is a symptom of a curse for the world. Since the wine must be plentiful, [the prophet] counts a larger number concerning it.

There they are pressed in the oil press, and the oil falls into the vats, and from the vats into the bowl, and from the bowl into the tubes, and from the tubes into the lamps.

[The scroll] is now coming forth from the Holy of Holies, from before the Shechinah, to walk to and fro upon the face of the entire land; this is the meaning of “its length is twenty, and its width is ten” - as the measure of the entrance to the Temple court and the Temple, through which it shall emerge.
<b>for whoever stole</b> until now.
<b>was cleared from such as this</b> He was cleared from this retribution, as it delineated on it [i.e., the scroll]. The retribution of individuals who transgressed the Torah was not meted out, but He waited until the measure of all of them was filled, and they all suffered at once with the destruction and the exile. Similarly, everyone who heretofore swore falsely, was cleared of the retribution as delineated in this scroll and was not requited, but from now on...

And behold, now they are placed in its midst to be punished in the midst of that very measure that they meted out, a measure for a measure.
<b>And he cast her</b> Heretofore she had been sitting, but he cast her and knocked her into its midst, symbolizing torments and punishments.

<b>on its base</b> On its permanence and on its base. Here He hinted [to Zechariah] that, because of the iniquity of Israel, who measured out [so to speak] with the measure of sins and wickedness, they were punished with the same measure. And there came two nations that ruled together; they were Babylon and the Chaldeans - the army of Nebuchadnezzar - and exiled [Israel] to Babylon where [Israel] stayed fixed on a base, a base that was established for them. That is according to the completion of the seventy years until now, when they returned. This interpretation leans partially toward that of Jonathan. This [phrase] is interpreted in many [other] ways, but they are not satisfactory to me. Our Sages, however, explained and learned from here that the evil inclination was given into the hands of the men of the Great Assembly, and they cast it into a leaden cauldron and covered it with lead, because lead absorbs the sound, as is stated in tractate Sanhedrin (24a) and in tractate Yoma (69b). My interpretation of the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar as doubled - composed of two nations - I saw in Midrash Psalms (6:2, 18: 10), that the following four kingdoms that subjugated Israel were double: Babylon and the Chaldeans, Media and Persia, Greece and Macedon, Edom and Ishmael, and for this reason the Kalir composed (in Piyutim for Shemini Azereth), “It is the fourth; it is the eighth,” concerning Edom.

<b>In the land of Hadrach</b> R’ Judah the son of Ilai expounded: This is the Messiah, who is sharp against the nations and soft to Israel. R’ Yose the son of a Damascene mother said to him [to Judah the son of Ilai]: “Judah, our master, how long will you pervert the verses for us? I call heaven and earth to testify for me, that I am from Damascus, and there is a place named Hadrach. [Rabbi Yose continued:] Now how do I explain: ‘And Damascus is His resting place?’” That Jerusalem is destined to reach as far as Damascus. ‘His resting place’ means only Jerusalem, as it is said: (Psalms 132:14) “This is My resting place to eternity.” He said to him [i.e. R’ Judah to R’ Yose]: “Now how do I explain (Jer. 30: 18) ‘And the city shall be built on its mound?’” He replied: “That it is not destined to move from its place.” So was the baraitha taught in Sifre (Deut. 1:1).
<b>for man’s eye shall be to the Lord</b> For on that day man will turn to his Maker, and his eyes will see the Holy One, blessed be He, as [the prophet] states above: Let us go with you. And they and their cities will join the cities of Israel.

Similarly, Scripture states (I Kings 11: 1): “King Solomon loved many foreign women and the daughter of Pharaoh.” Now, was the daughter of Pharaoh not included in the generalization?

<b>I cut off the three shepherds in one month</b> They corrupted their ways until I rejected them, and I slew all three shepherds in one month.

<b>I could not tolerate them</b> “My soul was short with them” I rejected them. And every expression of shortness of soul denotes a distressful or disgusting matter, that a person’s thoughts cannot tolerate. His heart and his reigns are too short to contain it, as Elihu said (Job 32:18), “The spirit of my innards constrains me.”
<b>moreover, they were too much for Me</b> Their memory was too big for My innards, and it filled My spirit and constrained My reins. The word בָּחֲלָה was explained by our Sages in tractate Niddah (47a) as an expression of largeness. The Sages depicted the development of a woman with a metaphor: פַּגָּה, unripe figs; בֹּחַל, larger figs, and צֶמֶל, completely ripe figs. She is compared to unripe figs when she is still a child; she is compared to larger figs in the days of her youth, when she is already bigger. They brought this verse as proof of their words.

For, on that condition I gave them the Torah, that if they keep it, they will be free from the kingdoms; that no nation or tongue shall rule over them. And do not be surprised if Scripture speaks of their salvation from the hands of the enemy as forming a covenant with the enemy, for we find a similar verse (Hosea 2:20): “And I will make a covenant for them on that day with the beasts of the field, etc.”

<b>And they weighed out My hire, thirty pieces of silver</b> Jonathan paraphrases: And they performed My will with a few men. There were a few good men among them, such as the craftsmen and the sentries, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah, and Ezekiel. But I do not know how to explain the expression here of thirty pieces of silver exactly, except that כֶּסֶף is an expression of desire. Our Sages, too, explained it this way in Chullin (92a). They brought proof from (Prov. 7:20), “The bundle of the desirable ones He took in His hand.” The thirty they explained in the following manner: There are forty-five righteous men in every generation. They brought proof from (Hosea 3:2), “a חֹמֶר of barley and a לֶתֶךְ of barley” - fifteen righteous in Babylon and thirty in Eretz Israel. It is said: “And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and I cast them into the house of the Lord in Eretz Israel.” The number thirty is explained by the Midrash Aggadah (Cf. Gen. Rabbah 49:3, Pesikta d’Rav Kahana 88a), that our father Abraham was promised that no generation would have fewer than thirty righteous in men, the number of (Gen. 15:8): “So shall your seed be.” The word יִהְיֶה has the numerical value of thirty.
@13
<b>And the Lord said to me: Cast it to the keeper of the treasury</b> like הָאוֹצֵר, the keeper of the treasury. Said the Holy One, blessed be He, to the prophet: Write, and leave over these and their righteousness to be preserved for the end of the seventy years of the Babylonian exile. The Temple shall be built by them. Now what is the treasury? [Cf. below]
<b>the stronghold of glory</b> My Temple, the stronghold of My glory.
<b>of which I stripped them</b> of which I stripped them so that they should no longer have glory. The expression יָקַרְתִּי means the removal of glory; the “mem” in מֵעֲלֵיהֶם proves it. It is like (Ps. 52:7), “and He shall uproot you from the land of the living”; and like (Isa. 10:33), “lops off the branches.” My explanation is similar to Jonathan’s translation. I have seen many variant versions of the explanation of this prophecy, but I cannot reconcile those with the text.
@14
<b>And I cut off My second staff</b> I exiled Zedekiah.
<b>the destroyers</b> The wicked of his generation, for he was righteous, but his generation was wicked.
<b>to nullify the brotherhood</b> that the Judahites and the Benjamites were joined in brorherhood, and that they adhered to the abominations of the kings of Israel.
@15
<b>Take for yourself, etc.</b> This is what He said to him above: Tend the flock of slaughter (verse 4). This is a sign that I am destined to deliver the generation of the destruction of this Second Temple into the hands of Esau.
@16
<b>Those that are cut off</b> The shepherd will not remember to seek the lost ones.
<b>the foolish ones he shall not seek</b> Jonathan renders: Those that wandered off he shall not seek. The word הַנַּעַר means the foolish ones that do not know to enter the fold.
<b>the one that can stand</b> The one that has a little strength to stand on its feet and requires help, [the one that needs] to be led slowly. Menahem (Machbereth p. 148) explained: and the swollen one, as in (Num. 5:22), “to cause the belly to swell.”
<b>he shall not bear</b> Jonathan renders. he shall not bear. It is the custom of the shepherd to carry the lambs in his bosom.
<b>And the flesh of the fat one he shall eat</b> He will finish the money of the wealthy.
<b>and their hoofs he shall break</b> until they are finished. Daniel (7:7) stated a figure similar to this: “It devoured and broke in pieces, and the residue it trampled with its foot.”
@17
<b>Ho</b> There is reason to cry out concerning this.
<b>worthless shepherd</b> a shepherd of nought. אֶ לִיל, is an expression of אַל, naught; he is not a shepherd. [There is also] (in Job 13:4) “worthless physicians.” רֹעִי The “yud” is superfluous; it is instead of a “he,” as “who abandons the flock”; (Deut. 33:16) who dwells (שׁכְנִי) in the bramble”; and (Micha 7:14) “who dwells alone.”
<b>who abandons the flock</b> Who leaves them free for anyone who comes to beat, to slay, and to spoil.
<b>A sword is on his arm and his right eye</b> And that shepherd carries a slaughtering knife in his hand to slaughter the fat and the healthy, upon which he cast his right eye to know who are the wealthy, to spoil and finish their property
<b>his arm shall wither</b> In the future (as in Ezek. 25:14), “I will wreak My vengeance, etc.” The commentators, however, interpreted this as a reference to Zedekiah, an allusion to (II Kings 25:7), “and they blinded Zedekiah’s eyes.” But it is impossible to reconcile “Behold! I am setting up a shepherd in the land” as referring to Zedekiah, for seventy years had already passed after him.

<b>a cup of weakness</b> a vessel of weakness, as in (Exod. 12:22), “in the blood that is in the cup.”
<b>weakness</b> an expression of bewilderment, [it means] the clogging of the heart and the limbs, for, like man enwrapped in a garment, they have no strength, as in (Nahum 2:4), “And the cypress trees were enwrapped” ; and (Isa. 3:19) “And the bracelets and the veils.” In the language of the Mishnah (Shabbath 6:6) we find, “Arabian women may go out veiled.” It is involopiment in O.F.
<b>and also on Judah</b> the nations that will be in siege against Jerusalem will impose upon Judah, for the house of David will be inside and the gentiles will besiege them. And also, the children of Judah will come, against their will, to besiege Jerusalem. So did Jonathan render it.

<b>I will seek to destroy</b> I will seek their destruction, and I will be exact in judging their iniquity. And our Sages (Avodah Zarah 4a) explained this verse as concerning merit. I will search in the books of their deeds; if they have merit, I will spare them; otherwise, I will destroy them.
@10
<b>a spirit of grace and supplications</b> That it should come into their mind to supplicate Me, and they will be in My good graces.
<b>a spirit</b> Talant in Old French, a desire.
<b>they shall look to Me because of those who have been thrust through</b> Jonathan renders: And they shall supplicate Me because of their wanderings. And they shall look to Me to complain about those of them whom the nations thrust through and slew during their exile.
<b>and they shall mourn over it</b> Over that slaughter.
<b>as one mourns over an only son</b> As a man mourns over his only son. And our Sages expounded this in tractate Sukkah (52a) as referring to the Messiah, son of Joseph, who was slain.
@11
<b>like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the Valley of Megiddon</b> Hadadrimmon has no connection to the Valley of Megiddon. These are, rather, two cases of mourning. [The first is] like the mourning of Ahab the son of Omri, who was slain by Hadadrimmon the son of Tabrimmon in Ramoth Gilead, as it is stated (I Kings 22:36): “A cry passed through the camp.” That is the mourning [of Ahab. The second case is] like the mourning of Josiah the son of Amon, who was slain by Pharoah the lame in the Valley of Megiddon, as it is stated (II Chron. 35:25): “And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women spoke in their laments, etc.”

@14

<b>and the flock shall scatter</b> The flock subjected to his rule; lit. pressed down under his hand.
<b>and I will return My hand</b> And I will repeat My blows a second time.
<b>upon the little ones</b> Upon the rulers who are smaller than the kings. And Jonathan renders:
<b>and the flock shall scatter</b> And the rulers shall scatter, and he renders:
<b>upon the little ones</b> Their officers, who are second to them. And so did Jonathan render this verse as referring to the nations: O sword, reveal yourself against the king and against the ruler, his colleague who is like him, who resembles him, said the Lord of Hosts. Slay the king, and the rulers shall scatter. This wording of the Targum does not apply to Israel, for we do not find in the Targum or in the Scriptures [any words] but “a king and princes” [when referring to Israel], and the Aramaic translation thereof is רַבְרְבִין, great ones.
@8

@9
<b>And I will bring the third in fire</b> And I will bring the third in straits in the smelting-pot of fire (Jonathan), so that some of the proselytes should bear the birth pang of the Messiah and the war of Gog and Magog with Israel. From there they shall be tested [as to] whether [or not] they are true proselytes. Then, many of those who previously converted to Judaism shall return to their pre- conversion customs and join Gog. We find [this idea] in the Aggadah (Avodah Zarah 3b; Midrash Psalms 2:5, footnote 29).

@2
<b>and the rest of the people</b> Not all of them will be exiled. Now, why will He permit them [i.e., the gentile nations] to exile half of them and to plunder the houses? So that they should not have an excuse, saying, “We have not come for war, but we have come to prostrate ourselves.”

<b>and half of it to the south</b> Toward the south; and the valley between them will have its beginning to the east and its end to the west.
@5
<b>And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains</b> Jonathan renders. And the valley of the mountains shall be stopped up. Since Jerusalem is surrounded by mountains, and there is a valley between the mountains in the north and the Mount of Olives, and [this is also] so in the south, when half of the Mount of Olives draws toward the mountain in the north, the valley between them will be stopped up. [This will also be] so in the south.
<b>shall reach</b> The height of the valley that will be between the mountains.
<b>to Azal</b> To the height of the mountaintops that are from either side. So did Menahem classify this (Machbereth p. 32), with (Isa. 41:9) “and from its nobles I called you.” Its meaning is an expression of height.
<b>and you shall flee</b> when you see this great wonder.
<b>as you fled because of the earthquake</b> [Isa. 6:4] “And the doorposts quaked” on the day that Uzziah was stricken with zaraath.
<b>all holy ones</b> Angels.
@6
<b>there shall be no light, only disappearing light and thick darkness</b> Jonathan renders. There shall not be light, only light that passes away, and thickness, i.e., there shall not be splendrous light, only יְקָרוֹת and קִפָּאוֹן shall [there] be. יְקָרוֹת An expression similar to (Ps. 37:20), “like the disappearing light over the plains.” Like a sort of light that appears in the morning over the mountains and disappears little by little. וְקִפָּאוֹן Congealed and dark and thick, like ice that is congealed and frozen, as in (Job 10: 10), “And like cheese You curdled me.”
@7
<b>And it shall be one day</b> And this thing shall be one day of the day of the Holy One, blessed be He. That day shall be known, that it is for the preparation of the salvation by the Holy One, blessed be He.

<b>nor night</b> Nor a time of trouble, like the trouble of the preceding subjugation by the kingdoms, shall [these days] be, for they will be the days of the Messiah, and there shall be no subjugation during these days.
<b>and it shall come to pass that at eventide</b> Before the thousand years are up there shall be a splendrous light, and all the good promised to Israel [will come]. And so did Jonathan translate: Not like the light of day and not like the darkness of night.
@8
<b>And it shall come to pass on that day</b> when the Mount of Olives will split from east to west.
<b>spring water shall come forth from Jerusalem</b> and flow to the east by way of the crevice to...
<b>the eastern sea</b> which is to the east of the world; and half of it will turn to the west, to the western sea. This is the spring concerning which Joel (4:18) prophesied: “And a spring shall emanate from the house of the Lord.” That is the spring concerning which Ezekiel (47:3) prophesied: “And he measured a thousand cubits and he made me pass through the water.”
@9

@10
<b>The whole earth shall be changed</b> The whole earth shall be changed to be like a plain. The mountains will be lowered, and the whole world will be a plain; and Jerusalem will be a mountain, so that it should appear higher than everything [else in the world].
<b>from the hill of Rimmon</b> We learned in Tosefta of Sotah (11:14): South of Jerusalem is a plain, and the hill of Rimmon is rocks and clods. Rather, so is [the] interpretation [of this phrase]: From the hill of Rimmon, which is a mountainous place from there [the mountains of the world] will begin to be changed, to [be] a plain; and they will be like the south of Jerusalem, which is a plain.
<b>but it will be elevated high</b> Since its entire environs are a plain, it will appear high.
<b>and remain in its old place</b> in its place
<b>until the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel</b> which will also be in its place; and from there shall extend the length of the city.
<b>until the king’s wine-cellars</b> Jonathan renders: the pits off the king, fosec in Old French. [This is] like [a word in] Baba Kamma 50b, “trenches and caves.” And so, all wine cellars in Scripture are expressions of trenches, referring to the pit that is before the wine press, into which the wine flows. And the Midrash Aggadah (Pesikta d’Rav Kahana p. 143a; Song Rabbah 7:4, cf. Mattenoth Kehunnah, Radal) [identifies] the pits of the king with the ocean: that Jerusalem will reach the end of the whole world, the pits dug out by the supreme King of kings.

<b>the festival of Tabernacle</b> As our Sages explained in tractate Avodah Zarah (3a): I have an easy commandment named Sukkah, as is stated in the first halachic discussion.
@17
<b>rain</b> Actual rain to cause the produce of their land to grow. Now, what reason did He have for decreeing upon them the withholding of rain? That the commandments of the festival are based on the rains: the four species of the lulav and the water libation are to appease God for water. Since the festival of Tabernacles is the time of the rains of the year, no rain will fall on those who entertain doubts concerning the festival of Tabernacles. This is learned in the Tosefta of Sukkah (4:7).
@18
<b>And if the family of Egypt does not go up</b> and they do not require rain, for the Nile comes up and waters it [i.e., the land of Egypt].
<b>it shall not [rain] upon them</b> Their rain shall not be upon them; i.e., the Nile will not water them, and so did Jonathan render: The Nile shall not ascend upon them.

@20
<b>there will be upon the bells of the horses</b> On the bells that are hung on the horse for beauty between its eyes (Pesachim 50a). Those, too, will be consecrated to make service vessels: sprinkling basins for the blood and pots to cook the flesh of the many sacrifices.
<b>Yea, every pot...will be</b> All those that are used to remove the ashes, they too will be of gold and of silver, like the sprinkling basins that are before the altar.

<b>The burden of the word of the Lord</b> Porport in Old French, burden. A word delivered to Malachi to bear to the children of Israel.
<b>in the hand of Malachi</b> It was already delivered into his hand for many days. From here, our Sages expounded in a baraitha of Mechilta that all the prophets stood on Mount Sinai and there the prophecies were delivered to them, and so [Isaiah (48:16)] says: “From the time it was, there was I, and now, the Lord God has sent me, [and His spirit].”

@7
<b>You offer on My altar, etc., yet you say</b> And if you say.
<b>“How have we defiled You?”</b> How have we defiled for You the bread of Your altar? I reply to you that, in this manner you have defiled Me.
<b>By your saying, “God’s table is contemptible.”</b> They would look with contempt on sharing equally the meal offerings and the hallowed foods, and they would say, “Since we may not share a meal offering for a meal offering, or a sacrifice for a sacrifice, it is too much bother and toil to divide each meal offering for the olive-sized piece or the bean-sized piece that is apportioned to each one.”
@8

@9
<b>And now, will you pray before the Lord?</b> And now, you priests, who commit this evil, how does it enter your mind that you can be the messengers of Israel, to supplicate God to have compassion on them? Lo, this evil has come from your hand.

@10

<b>and that you would not kindle fire on My altar in vain</b> with fire offerings with which I am not placated, for I have no desire in you. And our Sages expounded in Torath Kohanim (7: 154): If a person says to his friend, “Close this door for me,” he does not demand compensation for it; [or if he says,] “Light this candle for me,” he does not request compensation for it. But you - who is there among you who closed My doors, gratis? Neither did you kindle fire on My altar gratis. Surely, things that are customarily done for compensation you did not do gratis. Therefore, I have no desire in you.
@11
<b>My Name is great among the nations</b> Our Sages stated (Men. 110a): For they call Him the God of the gods. Even one who has an idol knows that He is the God Who is over all of them - and everywhere they donate in My Name. Our Sages, however, explained: These are the Torah scholars who are engaged in the laws of the Temple service everywhere, and likewise, every prayer of Israel that they pray anywhere is to Me as a pure oblation. And so did Jonathan paraphrase: And every time that you do My will, I accept your prayer, and My great Name is sanctified through you, and your prayer is like a pure offering before Me. This is the explanation of the verse: Now why do you profane My Name? Is it not great among the nations? As for Me, My love and My affection are upon you wherever you pray before Me, and even in exile, [offerings are] burnt and offered up to My Name.
<b>yea, a pure oblation</b> it is to Me, for through you My Name is feared among the nations. Yet you profane Me and My Name.
@12

<b>And this second thing you do</b> The first matter concerning which I reproved you is, indeed, very grave, for one to have married a gentile woman even if he was unmarried; but this second matter is graver, for those [who were] married to Israelite women and married gentile women in addition to them. [The men did this] because the Israelite women became black from hunger and from exile, and became repugnant to them. [Such a man] would, therefore, sit her [his Israelite wife] in his house, bound in living widowhood, and the gentile wife would be the chief wife.

The source of all of them is (Ezek. 24:17), “Be silent in groaning” But if אֳנָקָה is an expression of a cry, where is the silence? The Targum of this word is דִמְדַנְקִין, and so did Jonathan translate (ibid. 30: 43) “And you shall sigh before yourselves ותְדַנְקוּן.” [This is] an expression of a person who roars and feels pain within himself.

<b>Now what does the one seek</b> Now what does the one member of the couple seek to find accusations against his wife, who is his mate, who is the seed of God? What does he claim of her that he disgraces her? This is the wording of Jonathan’s translation, except that Jonathan renders: Now what does the one seek except seed of God? The explanation is correct except for the fact that the word הָאֶחָד is pointed with “zakef” mark, and the mark of the “zakef” separates the word מְבַקֵּש from joining וּמָה הָאֶחָד. It connects it to זֶרַע אֱ-לֹֹהִים.
<b>He had a different spirit</b> His intention was not like your intention. He did not cast his eye upon her. He had a different intention. They said to him,

Jonathan’s translation appeals to me, because neither in Scripture nor in the Mishnah do we find שְׁאָר being used as an expression of “other” - except where a person can explain it as an expression of residue, as in (Dan. 7: 19), “which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet.” In the language of the Mishnah (Sanh. 8b), “And others liable to death” - outside of those delineated. But in the expression for which אַחֵר is used, שְׁאָר is not used.

Or, if this is not so, where is the God of judgment, for He does not requite them.

As soon as he found out that it was his son, he was happy. The Midrash Aggadah (Midrash Psalms 3:3) [states]: Because he saw his order intact, for his servants, and the Kerethite and Pelethite, who were the Sanhedrin were affirming his lordship over themselves. When he said to them (ibid. 15:14), “Arise and let us flee etc. from Absalom,” what is written there? (verse 15) “Whatever my lord the king shall choose, behold your servants [are ready to do].” And when he came to Mahanaim (ibid. 17:27), “Shobi, etc. and Machir the son of Amiel, etc. and Barzilai the Gileadite” came to meet him and sustained him there.

Ps. 5:1,2,4) some explain “nehiloth” as an expression of heritage, but that is not the meaning of the word; moreover, the contents of the psalm do not deal with heritage.

Because they will complain to Him, He will take them back and again show them their records, and He returns them to Gehinnom. This is a double embarrassment. Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani says: In the future, every nation will call to its god, but it will not answer. Consequently, they will call to the Holy One, blessed be He. He will say to them, “Had you called Me first, I would have answered you. Now you have made the idols of primary importance and Me of secondary import. Therefore, I will not answer,” for it is stated (below 18:42): “They pray, but no one saves them.” This refers to the idols, and afterward, “to the Lord, but He answered them not.” Therefore, it is said: “they shall return and be ashamed.”

<b>A shiggayon of David</b> Menachem says (p. 170) that this, too, is one of the names of a melody named for the instrument, and so he explained “on shigyonoth,” [in Habakkuk 3:1]. But our Sages (Mid. Ps. 7:18) explained it as an expression of error, that he confessed and prayed about the error that he had [committed by] reciting a song upon Saul’s downfall, as it is stated (in II Sam. 22:1): “And David spoke to the Lord, etc.” The contents of the psalm, however, do not indicate this, because it speaks of the nations (in verse 9): “May the Lord judge the peoples.” I, therefore, say that he recited it concerning Ishbi in Nob (II Sam. 21:16), who came upon him as a punishment for Saul; as our Rabbis explained, that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Through you, Doeg the Edomite was banished; through you, Saul and his sons were slain, etc.” as is stated in “Chelek” (Sanh. 95a). The errors that David asked of the Holy One, blessed be He, [were] that he [himself] be delivered into the hands of his enemies and that his descendants should not be destroyed. (The last sentence does not appear in all editions.) [Therefore, because his life was endangered,] David reversed his prayer and prayed that he should not fall into the hands of his enemies. Now this is its meaning: An error that David sang to the Lord because he had erred in saying to the Holy One, blessed be He, to deliver him into the hands of his enemies on account of Saul, who was slain because of him. Another explanation: Concerning the error of the skirt of Saul’s coat, which he had severed.

<b>and I stripped my adversary into emptiness</b> I destroyed his garment when I severed the skirt of his coat. Did I do it to destroy and to strip him and cause him to stand empty, and [was it done] with hatred? Only to let him know that he was delivered into my hand to kill him, and I did not kill him. [The word] חלצה is an expression of stripping off clothing.

This is strength [that emerges] from the mouth of the Levites and the priests, who are people raised in filth like babes and sucklings.

@8
<b>Flocks and cattle</b> Heb. צנה ואלפים [equivalent to] צאן ובקר, like (Deut. 7:13), “the young of your cattle (אלפך).” צנה is an expression of industry, as (in Num. 32:24), “and enclosures for your flocks (לצנאכם)”; oveyledic in Old French, enclosures to pen the small livestock. There are many Aggadic midrashim, but they do not fit the verses.

<b>to brighten the youth</b> Heb. על מות לבן. Some interpret על מות לבן, on the death of Absalom, but this interpretation is not plausible because he [David] states: לבן ; he does not state הבן. Others interpret על מות לבן [as referring to] Nabal. Neither is this plausible, to invert the name. Moreover, no mention is made of him in the psalm. (The preceding paragraph does not appear in most editions.) I saw in the Great Masorah that it is one word, judging by the fact that it is compared to (below 48:15): “He will lead us as in youth (על מות).” Menachem and Dunash interpreted what they interpreted, but it does not seem correct to me. I saw in the Pesikta (d’Rav Kahana, p. 25a) that the chapter deals with Amalek and Esau (as in verse 6): You rebuked nations; You destroyed a wicked man. But I say that this song, למנצח על מות לבן, is for the future, when the childhood and the youth of Israel will be brightened; their righteousness will be revealed and their salvation will draw near, that Esau and his seed will be erased, according to our Torah. (The last phrase does not appear in most editions.) על מות means childhood. לבן is like ללבן, to whiten. Menachem interpreted על מות לבן, melodies to teach, and this is its interpretation: To the conductor למנצח, to the conductor, melodies to teach, in which case לבן is equivalent to להבין ולבונן, to understand and to comprehend; על מות, named for a musical instrument called עלמות, as is stated (below 46:1): “on alamoth-shir.” Dunash (p. 15f) interpreted לבן as the name of a man whose name was Labben, who fought with David in those days, and the Psalmist’s statement, “You rebuked nations, You destroyed a wicked man”this wicked man is Labben, who slew innocent people. Although you do not come upon a man named Labben anywhere else but this place, you find the same with other names, which are found in Scripture only once. (This entire account of Dunash’s interpretation does not appear in early mss. Menachem’s interpretation is presented very briefly.)

<b>The enemy has been destroyed</b> for the swords of hatred are perpetually upon him like a sharp sword. Another explanation: חרבות לנצח that enemy, the swords of whose hatred were upon us forever. That is the one concerning whom it is stated (in Amos 1:11): “and kept their fury forever.” Another explanation: חרבות is an expression of destruction, and this is its interpretation: The enemy has been destroyed; his ruins are perpetual. And so it is stated (in Ezek. 35:9): “I will make you perpetual desolations, and your cities shall not be restored.”
<b>and You have uprooted the cities</b> “Should Edom say, ‘We are poor, but we will return and build the ruins’? So said the Lord of Hosts: ‘They shall build, but I shall demolish’” (Malachi 1:4).

They asked him: Is it not written: May the wicked return to the grave (לשאולה)? Replied Rabbi Abba bar Zavda: To the lowest level of Sheol. What does it mean that they will return? After they emerge from Gehinnom and stand in judgment and are found guilty, they return to the lowest level of Gehinnom.

<b>congratulates</b> Heb. בֵּרֵך, like בֵּרַך, an expression of the past tense. You should know [that this is so,] for if it were a noun, the accent would be on the first letter and it would be vowelized with a “pattah” [meaning a “seggol” under the “resh”], but this one is vowelized with a small “kamatz” [i.e., with a “tzereh”] and it is accented below on the “resh.” Do not wonder about בֵּרֵך, that he did not say: בֵּרַך, because many words spelled with a “resh” are vowelized in this manner, e.g. (below 74:18), “an enemy blasphemed (חֵרֵף) the Lord,” and it does not say חֵרַף.

<b>on Your army</b> Heb. לחלכה ; (verse 14), “upon You Your army (חלכה) leaves.” Both of them are in the masorah as words spelled with כה instead of ך, like (Exod. 7:29), “upon you (ובכה) and upon your people”; (Prov. 2:11), “discretion shall guard you (תנצרכה) (Exod. 29:35), “I commanded you (אתכה)”; (I Sam. 1: 26), “who was standing with you (עמכה).” We learn from the masorah that חלכה is like חילך, Your army. But Menachem (p.89) interprets לחלכה יצפנו and so יעזב חלכה like (verse 10), “and helpless ones (חלכאים) shall fall into his power,” a word meaning humble and moaning. Accordingly, כה is [part of] the radical.
@10
<b>He crouches, he bows down</b> So is the habit of the lurker; he crouches and lowers [himself] and makes himself small in order to be inconspicuous.
<b>and an army of broken people fall by his signals</b> Heb. חלכאם, an army of broken people. I saw in the great masorah that חלכאים is one of fifteen words that are written as one word and read as two words, as is בגד in the verse (Gen. 30:11) commencing “And Leah said.” Also (in Deut. 33:2), “a fiery Law (אשדת) is to them”; (Isa. 3: 15), “What do you mean (מלכם) that you crush My people?” Also this word means חל כאים, an army of broken people. כאים is an expression of (below 109:16) “and a broken-hearted one (ונכאה לבב) to kill.” If you say that the “nun” is the radical, (Ezek. 13:22) “Because you have broken (הכאות) the heart of the righteous” will prove that [it is not]. We learn that the “nun” of נראה is like the “nun” of (I Sam. 15:9) נמבזה and the “nun” of (Jer. 6:14) נקלה, and so is its interpretation: and...fall by the signals of this wicked man, with his hints and his winks, an expression of (Isa. 41:21) “present your signals (עצמותיכם).” and (ibid. 33:15) “and closes (ועצם) his eyes,” an army of poor people. Another explanation: בעצומיו, by his mighty men. Said Rabbi Simon: This wicked man puts into his “callirus,” meaning army, only mighty men like himself, as it is said (in Dan. 3:20): “And he commanded the mighty warriors who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abed- nego” (Mid. Ps. 10:5). However, Menachem, (p. 89) interprets חלכאים as “poor and weak (וחלך),” the “chaf” being a radical.

Menachem (p. 132) interprets יעזב as an expression of help, as (in Exod. 23:5): “you shall help (עזב תעזב) with him.” He interprets חלכה as an expression of “poor and weak (חלך),” the “chaf” being a radical.

How do You, who drive away my soul, say to me,...
<b>“Wander from your mountain”?</b> Pass over your mountain, you wandering bird. For every wandering person is compared to a bird that wanders from its nest, as it is written (in Prov. 27:8): “As a bird wandering from its nest, so is a man wandering from his place.” For your nest has wandered, because we have driven you from the entire mountain like a wandering bird.

<b>burning</b> Heb. זלעפות, an expression of burning. Menachem (p. 79) interprets it as an expression of (Isa. 28:2) “a storm of destruction (שער קטב).” Likewise, (in Lam. 5:10), “because of the heat of (זלעפות) hunger”; (below 119:53), “burning (זלעפה) seized me.” That is to say, (as in Ezek. 27:35), “became greatly alarmed (שערו שער).” (The quotation from Menachem appears only in several early printed editions, and not in any manuscript.)

There are many [examples] in the Book of Proverbs, and in Habakkuk (2:3): “and He shall speak (יפח) of the end, and it shall not fail.” However, Menachem (p. 141), interpreted it as an expression of a snare, as (below 124:7) “the snare (הפח) broke.”

<b>silver refined</b> They are like refined silver that is exposed to the entire land.
<b>exposed</b> Heb. בעליל, an expression of revealing; in the language of the Mishna (Rosh Hashanah 21b, see Gemara): “whether it was plainly (בעליל) visible or whether it was not plainly (בעליל) visible, etc.” Others explain בעליל as an expression of elevation, and this is its explanation: silver refined with the best earth. That is to say, like silver that is refined with the best earth and its upper layer, because a person makes a crucible to refine the silver from the best earth. Another explanation: בעליל is like בעלי, with a mortar (as in Prov. 27:22): “among grain with a pestle,” which is the name of a utensil in which [grain] is crushed. Similarly, בעליל is the crucible in which gold and silver are smelted. However, this does not seem correct because he does not call עלי the mortar in which [the grain] is crushed, but the handle of the pestle with which they crush. This is called pilon in French, pestle. Another explanation: בעליל is an expression of the master of a hand, i.e., the master of the earth, and the praise of the word applies to God. Targum Jonathan, too, renders it as an expression of lordship. He says that His sayings are like silver, refined by the Lord of the earth, Who is God, for He refined and clarified them.

<b>when the basest to the sons of men is elevated</b> Heb. כרם זלות לבני אדם [They walk on all sides] because of their envy, for they are jealous of my greatness, that I was taken from behind the sheep to be a king. This is the interpretation of כרם זלות לבני אדם: when a man considered by the sons of men to be base is elevated. This is on the order of the passage elsewhere (below 118:22): “The stone that the builders rejected became a cornerstone.” The Midrash Aggadah interprets it concerning Israel in the future, when they will be elevated. [Unknown Midrashic source] Menachem interprets כרם זלות לבני אדם (pp. 78, 164): like a gluttonous wild ox to devour the sons of men. Accordingly, כרם is rendered: like a רים or ראם, and זלות is like (Deut. 21:20) זולל וסבא, “a glutton and a drunkard.” The following is its interpretation: The wicked walk on all sides around the poor man; the wicked walk to swallow him for naught, as a wild ox to swallow the sons of men.

<b>He did not slander with his tongue</b> Ankuza in Old French, to accuse, as (in II Sam. 19:28) “And he slandered (וירגל) your servant.” This psalm is to inform us of the [proper] measure of piety.
<b>and speaks truth in his heart</b> The good that he says in his heart is true. He is not a hypocrite [lit. one in mouth and one in heart].
<b>neither did he take up reproach</b> Rapporta in Old French, to report.
<b>upon his kinsman</b> If his kinsman committed a transgression for which he was punishable, he would punish him with justice, and he did not bear upon himself his reproach, that the reproacher should have an excuse to say, “So-and-so, your relative, committed such-and-such a sin, and you covered up for him.”
@4
<b>A base person is despised in his eyes</b> One who is base with his wickedness is despised in the eyes of the righteous man, e.g. Hezekiah, who dragged his father’s remains in disgrace.
<b>he swears to hurt</b> himself.
<b>and does not retract</b> his oath. How much more does he not retract it if it concerns something that is not to his hurt!
@5
<b>nor did he accept a bribe, etc.</b> against a poor man, to condemn him in judgment by judging perversely. Our Sages explained it further to mean that he would not accept a bribe to exonerate him in judgment, and he certainly will not take a bribe to pervert the judgment.
<b>shall not falter</b> and he deserves to sojourn in Your tent.
<b>shall not falter forever</b> If he falters, his faltering will not be permanent faltering, but he will falter and ascend.

<b>A michtam of David</b> Our Sages said (Sotah 10b, Mid. Ps. 16:1): Of David, who was poor (מך) and perfect (ותם), whose wound (מכתו) was perfect (תמה), for he was born circumcised. However, the sequence of the verse here does not lend itself to be interpreted according to the Midrash. There are psalms prefaced by the title לדוד מכתם, which may be interpreted: This song is David’s, who was poor and perfect, but here, where it is stated מכתם לדוד, it cannot be interpreted in this manner. I therefore say that it is one of the names of the various types of melodies and the variations in the music. Another explanation: מכתם is an expression of a crown, like כתם, meaning that David was accustomed to say, “O God, guard me for I have taken refuge in You.” And this was to him as a crown, as it is stated (5:13): “You shall crown him with will.”
@2
<b>You should say to the Lord, “You are my Master, etc.”</b> David addresses the Congregation of Israel. “It is your duty to say to the Lord, ‘You are the Master, and You have the upper hand in all that befalls me.’” Another explanation: You should say to the Lord, “You are my Master.” He [David] was saying this to his soul. Similarly, we find on this order (in II Sam. 13:39): “And David longed,” which means: And the soul of David longed. Here too, “You, my soul, have said to the Lord,” you my soul, should say to the Holy One, blessed be He. (The second interpretation appears in very few early editions.)
<b>my good is not incumbent upon You.</b> The benefits that You do for meit is not incumbent upon You to bestow [them] upon me, because You do not benefit me on account of my righteousness.
@3
<b>For the holy ones who are in the earth</b> For the sake of the holy ones who are buried in the earth, who walked before You with sincerity.
<b>and the mighty ones in whom is all my delight</b> They are the mighty ones in whom is all my delight and for whose sake all my necessities are accomplished.
@4
<b>May the sorrows...increase</b> All this you should say to the Lord, “May the sorrows of those who do not believe in You increase,” viz. those who hasten and scurry to idolatry. Another explanation: מהרו is an expression of מֹהַר, dowry, douaire in French.
<b>I will not pour their libations of blood</b> I will not be like them, to sprinkle blood for pagan deities, neither will I take up the name of pagan deities upon my lips.
@5
<b>The Lord is my allotted portion and my cup</b> All my benefit is from Him. Another explanation: כוסי means “my share,” as (in Exod. 12:4): “you shall make your count (תכסו) on the lamb.” This is how Menachem (p. 107) associated it.
<b>You guide my destiny</b> It is You Who placed my hand on the good share, as it is stated (in Deut. 30:19): “I have set life and death before you...Choose life...” as a man who loves one of his sons and lays his hand on the better share, saying, “Choose this one for yourself.”
<b>guide</b> Heb. תומיך. You lowered my hand onto the portion, an expression of (Ecc. 10: 18): “the rafter sinks (ימך),” is lowered. In this manner it is expounded upon in Sifrei (Deut. 11:26, 27). It can also be interpreted as an expression of support, according to the Midrash Aggadah, as (in Gen. 48:17) “he supported (ויתמך) his father’s hand.”
@6
<b>Portions have fallen to me in pleasant places</b> When the lot fell to me to be in Your portion, it is a pleasant portion. Also, such an inheritance is pleasing to me.
@7
<b>I will bless the Lord</b> Until here, David prophesied concerning the Congregation of Israel, that she would say this, and now he says, “I, too, will bless the Lord, Who counseled me to choose life and to go in His ways.”
<b>even at night my conscience instructs me</b> to fear Him and to love Him. Our Sages though, (Mid. Ps. 16:7) explained it as referring to our father Abraham, who learned Torah by himself before the Torah was given, but we must reconcile the verses according to their sequence.
@8
<b>I have placed the Lord before me constantly</b> In all my deeds, I have placed His fear before my eyes. Why? Because He is always at my right hand to help me so that I should not falter. Another explanation: I have placed the Lord before me constantly. [This alludes to] the sefer Torah [that] was with him [for him] to read all the days of his life [as in Deut. 17:19]. This is what he states: “from my right hand I will not falter,” meaning that because of the Torah in which I am engaged, which was given with His right hand, I will not falter. (This interpretation does not appear in any manuscript. It does, however, appear in several early printed editions.) Rashi to Sanhedrin explains that the “right hand” alludes to the Torah scroll that the king would carry suspended from his arm. David is confident that in the merit of that scroll, he will not falter.
@9
<b>Therefore, my heart rejoiced, etc.</b> because I am confident that You will not forsake my soul to the grave. Since, concerning the iniquity of a grave transgression which I committed, You sent me the tidings (in II Sam. 12:13): “Also the Lord has removed your sin,” certainly from now on You will not forsake me [to cause me] to turn away from You.
@11
<b>You shall let me know the way of life</b> This is the future tense, not an expression of prayer.
<b>the fullness of joys</b> Endless joy. That is the joy of the future. (Found only in certain manuscripts.)
<b>in Your presence</b> Joys that are before You, in a company that is near You.

@2
<b>May my judgment come forth from before You</b> May the sins for which I deserve to be judged with torments, go forth from before You and not come before You in judgment.
<b>may Your eyes see [my] upright acts</b> If I have merits, may Your eyes see the upright acts.
@3
<b>You have tried my heart, etc.</b> I know that I am guilty of a transgression, and, if the judgment of its punishment comes before You, I will not be declared innocent in the judgment, for You have already tried my heart.
<b>You have visited [upon me] at night</b> at eventide for the iniquity of Bathsheba, concerning which it is stated (in II Sam. 11:2) “And it came to pass at the time of evening, that David arose, etc.”
<b>You have refined me</b> You have tested me.
<b>and not found</b> You have not found in me Your desire.
<b>If I think, let it not pass my mouth</b> If it enters my thoughts again to be tried before You, let it not pass my mouth to say again, “Try me, O Lord, and test me,” as I have already said, as is written (26:2) “Try me, O Lord, and test me,” for David asked the Holy One, blessed be He, “Why do they say, ‘the God of Abraham,’ yet they do not say, ‘the God of David’?” He replied, “I tested him with ten tests, and he was found perfect.” He [David] said, “Try me and test me,” as appears in tractate Shabbath (?).
@4
<b>As for man’s deeds, because of the word of Your lips, etc. To support my feet, etc.</b> From then on, for every deed of man that I came to perform, I watched myself because of the word of Your lips; [I watched] the ways of the profligate, to turn away from them, so that I should not walk in them, but [would] support my feet constantly in Your paths, that my feet should not falter from them. Another explanation:
<b>For the deeds of man according to the word of Your lips, etc.</b> Since a person must use his deeds according to the uprightness (decre - early editions) of the word of Your lips, as You said, “You shall not commit adultery,”I kept myself from the ways of the profligate although I behaved unseemly according to the good You have done.
@5
<b>To support my feet</b> From then on, for every deed of man that I did improperly, may Your eyes see the upright deeds, but my judgment shall go forth from before you.
@6
<b>because You shall answer me, O God</b> Because I am confident that You will answer me.
@7
<b>Distinguish Your kind acts</b> Heb. הפלה, esevre in Old French, to separate, as (in Exod. 33:16): “and I and my people will be distinguished (ונפלינו).” With Your right hand You save those who take refuge in You from those who rise up against them. (This does not appear in manuscripts or in most early editions.) [The literal meaning is:] Distinguish Your kind acts, You Who save those who take refuge, etc. This is a transposed verse, meaning: Distinguish Your kind acts to save with Your right hand those who take refuge, etc.
@8
<b>as the apple</b> Heb. (כאישון). That is the pupil (lit. the black) of the eye, on which the vision depends. Because it is black, it is called אישון, an expression of darkness, and the Holy One, blessed be He, prepared a guard for it, viz. the eyelids, which constantly cover it.
@9
<b>who have robbed me</b> Because of this: my enemies, who encompass me to take my life, rob me.
@10
<b>[With] their fat, they closed themselves up</b> With their fat, they closed their heart and their eyes from looking at Your deeds, in fear of You.
@11
<b>[By] our footsteps they surround us now</b> By our footsteps, the enemies surround us now, and they set their eyes roaming over the land, to raid the land. It appears to me that David prayed this prayer after the incident of Uriah and Joab had happened to him, and the Israelites were in the land of the children of Ammon besieging Rabbah (II Sam. 11), and David feared that they would be defeated there because of the sin that he had committed, and the Philistines, Moab, Edom, and all the evil neighbors of Eretz Israel, who looked forward to the day of their misfortune, would hear and march against them.
@12
<b>which yearns</b> Heb. יכסף, yearns, as (in Gen. 31:30): “for you yearned (נכסף נכספתי).”
@13
<b>confront him</b> The enemy.
<b>bring him down to his knees</b> Beat his legs, and he will kneel and fall.
<b>rescue my soul</b> from every wicked man who is Your sword, for You give him the power to rule, to requite those who are bound to You.
@14
<b>Of those who die by Your hand</b> I choose to be one of those who die by Your hand on their bed.
<b>of those who die of old age</b> Heb. מחלד. Of those who die of old age, after they have “rusted” (חלודה), rodijjl in Old French, [rouille in Modern French] rust, and of the righteous, whose share is in life.
<b>and whose belly You will fill with Your hidden treasure</b> And of those whose innards You will fill with Your good, which You have hidden for those who fear You.
<b>their abundance</b> Their property that they leave over when they die.
@15
<b>I will see Your face with righteousness</b> in the future (Mid. Ps. 17:13), or
<b>I will see Your face with righteousness</b> Take my judgment away from before You and grasp the righteous deeds that I have performed, and through them I will see Your face. In other editions, this is one interpretation:
<b>I will see Your face with righteousness</b> In the future, take my judgment away from before You and grasp the righteous deeds that I have performed, and through them I will see Your face.
<b>I will be satisfied with Your image upon the awakening</b> I will be satisfied with the vision of Your image when the dead awaken from their sleep. In many editions, the following appears at this point: Another explanation: I will be satisfied from seeing Your face when the dead awaken from their sleep, for they are in the likeness of Your image, for so it is stated (in Gen. 9:6): “For in the image of God, He made man.”

<b>on the day the Lord saved him etc.</b> When he became old and all his troubles had already passed over him and he was saved from them.
<b>and from the hand of Saul</b> Was not Saul included? But [he is mentioned specifically] because he was the harshest to him and pursued him more than all of them. Similarly, you say (in Josh. 2:1): “see the land and Jericho.”
@2
<b>I love You</b> Heb. ארחמך, I love You, as the Targum renders (Lev. 19:18): “and you shall love your neighbor,” ותרחם.
@3
<b>my rock</b> For You saved me at the Rock of the Divisions (I Sam. 23:28), when I was trapped between Saul and his men, to be caught, as it is stated (in I Sam. 23:26): “but Saul and his men were encircling to David and his men etc.”
<b>and my fortress</b> Heb. ומצודתי, an expression of a fortress.
<b>my rock</b> Heb. צורי, an expression of a rock.
<b>I will take refuge</b> Abrier in French (to protect, cover; cf. Rashi to Isa. 30:2, Joel 4:16).
<b>I will take refuge in Him</b> I will take shelter in His shade, as the matter is stated (in Job 24:8): “and without shelter (מחסה) they embrace the rocks,” because the rocks are a shelter and a shield for the travelers from the winds and from the downpour of rains.
@4
<b>With praise I call to the lord</b> With praises I call Him and pray before Him constantly, i.e., even before the salvation I praise Him, because I am confident that I will be saved from my enemies.
@5
<b>Bands of death have encompassed me</b> On many occasions wicked men have surrounded me. אפפוני is like סבבוני. Similarly (below 40:13), “For countless evils...have encompassed (אפפו) me.”
<b>Bands of death</b> Heb. חבלי, camps of enemies, as (in I Sam. 10:5): “a band (חבל) of prophets.” But Jonathan renders: as a woman who sits on a birthstool, an expression of the pangs (חבלי) of a woman in confinement.
<b>and streams of scoundrels</b> That too is an expression of troops that flood like a stream.

<b>The earth shook and quaked</b> This is not connected to the preceding verse, but its beginning is connected to its end; i.e., when He was angered, the earth shook and quaked. [The word] כי is used as an expression of “when.” When He was angered and came to wreak the vengeance of His people, His servants, on Pharaoh and his people, the earth shook and quaked.
@9
<b>Smoke went up in His nostrils</b> (En ses nariles in Old French, in his nostrils.) So is the custom of every anger, to cause smoke to ascend from his nostrils.
@10
<b>And He bent the heavens, and He came down</b> to pass through the land of Egypt. “He came down” is to be understood in its simple meaning. Another explanation is “i atonvit” in Old French, to flatten, as (in Exod. 39:3), and the radical is רדד.
@11
<b>He swooped</b> Heb. וידא, He flew, as (in Deut. 28:49), “as the eagle swoops (ידאה).”
@12
<b>the darkness of waters</b> that are in the thick clouds of the skies are the darkness that is about Him. Lest you say that within the darkness there is no light, Scripture tells us: From the brightness before Him, and from within His partition, His thick clouds that are about Him are split, and hail and coals of fire pass through them.
@13
<b>passed</b> Heb. עברו, trepasant in Old French, passed. The hail split and passes through onto the Egyptians at the Sea of Reeds.
@16

<b>He drew me out</b> Heb. ימשני, an expression of drawing out, as (in Exod. 2:10), “I drew him out (משיתהו) of the water.”
@19
<b>They confronted me</b> My enemies would hasten and attack me early on the day of my calamity, but the Lord was, etc.
@21
<b>according to my righteousness</b> According to the righteousness of my following Him in the desert.
<b>according to the cleanness</b> Heb. כבד, an expression of cleanness, as (below 24:4), “and pure of heart.” Another explanation: He sent forth from on high [and] He took me. [David] said this about himself, concerning the angel who came to the Rock of the Divisions (I Sam. 23:27) to turn Saul away from him, as it is stated: “And an angel came to Saul, etc.”
<b>according to my righteousness</b> that I did not slay him when I sliced off the skirt of his coat. [Obviously, Rashi explains verses 8-17 as referring to Israel’s departure from Egypt. Only in verse 17 does he suggest the explanation that David refers to his own experiences.]

Said David (in Ps. 141:5): “May a righteous man smite me with loving-kindness,” and the Holy one, blessed be He, lowered the wall, and he scaled it (Mid. Ps. 18:24).

@34

@35
<b>so that a copper bow is bent by my arms</b> Heb. ונחתה, an expression of treading the bow, as (below 38:3): “Your arrows were driven (נחתו) into me.” Its radical [or its active voice] is נחת. When it is used in the passive voice, a dagesh comes and causes the “nun” to drop out. Hence נחתה is derived from ננחתה as (below 69:4): “My throat is dried (נחר),” derived from ננחר as (in Jer. 6:29): “The bellows is heated (נחר)”; נדף, rattling (in Lev. 26:36) is derived from ננדף ; “My eyes stream (נגרה)” (in Lam. 3:49), is like ננגרה ; “was given (נתנה)” (Gen. 38:14) is like ננתנה ; “they were smitten (נגף)” (II Sam. 10:15) is derived from ננגף. We cannot interpret it as being of the radical חתת, for then it would say נחתתה, as [it says] נעשתה, was done, from עשה ; נענתה, was answered, from ענה. Another explanation: and a copper bow is bent by my arms: חית is an expression of treading a bow, as (below 38:3): “Your arrows were driven (נחתו).” The “nun” is not of the radical but it is like נחלו “gave for inheritance” (in Jos. 14:1), and the copper bow was bent by my arms. Copper bows were hanging in David’s house. The kings of the nations would see them and say to each other, “Do you think that David has the strength to bend them? This is only to frighten us.” But he would hear [them] and bend the bows before them.

Menachem (Machbereth p. 45) explains it as (in Gen. 18:12): “after I have become old (בלתי),” and he explained נבל תבל in the same manner.
<b>and they shall fear</b> Heb. ויחרגו, an expression of fear; (in Deut. 32:25) “and terror from within,” the Targum renders: חרגת, fear of death.
<b>their imprisonments</b> Because of the tortures of the imprisonments in the dungeon where I imprison them and where they torture them. Menachem (p. 94) interprets it as an expression of loosening the girdle, and so he explains it: and they will be loosened of their girdles [meaning they will be frightened or weakened]. Dunash interprets ויחגרו ממסגרותיהם, and they will be lamed from their shackles, which are placed on their feet. The meaning of ויחגרו is: they will become lame, as the Aramaic for a lame person is חגר.
@47
<b>The Lord lives</b> He Who does all this for me.
@48
<b>Who grants me vengeance</b> Who gives me strength to avenge myself upon my enemies.
<b>and destroys</b> Heb. וידבר, and He slew, an expression of דבר, pestilence. Another explanation: as (in Exod. 3:1): “and he led (וינהג),” which is translated into Aramaic as וּדְבַר. Menachem (p. 61) too associated it in this manner. Likewise, he associated (below 47:4), “He leads (יַדְבֵּר) peoples under us.”
<b>instead of me</b> Heb. תחתי, in my place and in my stead, as the matter is stated (in Isa. 43:4): “and I give men in your stead (תחתיך), (verse 3), “I have given Egypt as your ransom. [Cush and Seba in your stead (תחתיך)].”

<b>The heavens recite the glory of God</b> The Psalmist himself explains the matter: There is neither speech nor words. They do not speak with people but since “their line goes forth throughout the earth” and they give light to the people, thereby the creatures recite the glory of God and give thanks and bless [Him] for the luminaries.
<b>and the sky tells of the work of His hands</b> The stars and planets, which are the work of the hands of the Holy One, blessed be He, and which are there, as it is stated (in Gen. 1:17): “And God placed them in the firmament of the heavens,” whence they proclaim His glory.

<b>and none is hidden from its heat</b> Had the sun been placed in the lowest sky, no man would be able to hide from its heat (Mid.

@8
<b>The law of the Lord is perfect</b> That too illuminates like the sun, as is written at the end of the topic: “enlightening the eyes,” and Scripture states (in Prov. 6:23): “For a commandment is a candle and the Torah is light.” Another explanation:
<b>and none is hidden from its heat</b> on the Day of Judgment, [as is stated in Malachi 3:19]: “And the sun that comes shall burn them up.” But the law of the Lord is perfect; it restores the soul to ways of life and it protects those who study it from that burning, as is stated (ibid. verse 20): “And the sun of mercy shall rise with healing...for you who fear My Name.”
<b>the testimony of the Lord is faithful</b> It is faithful to testify for those who study it.
<b>restoring the soul</b> It [the law] restores it [the soul] from the ways of death to the ways of life. The law, the testimony, the orders, the commandments, the fear, and the judgments total six, corresponding to the six orders of the Mishnah. Between each name [of God] are five words including the name itself, corresponding to the Five Books of the Pentateuch. And so [the Psalmist] concludes: “true, altogether just.” They are altogether devised with kindness and truth.

<b>and drippings of honeycombs</b> Heb. ונפת צופים, sweetness of honeycombs; breche, or bresches, honeycombs. Menachem interprets ונפת as an expression of a drop, and so (in Prov. 5:3): “drip sweetness (נפת)”; (ibid. 7:17), “I sprinkled (נפתי) my couch.”
@12
<b>for in observing them there is great reward</b> I was careful in its observance because of Your great good that You have hidden away, and according to this usage, עקב is like (Gen. 26:5): “because (עקב) Abraham hearkened to My voice.” Another explanation of עקב רב: The end of the Torah scholars is that they will come to greatness. עקב is an expression of the end, and there is a similar expression in the language of the Mishnah (Sotah 9:15): “At the end (בעקבות) of the exile, prior to the coming of the Messiah.”

To a Cuthite who goes from door to door, and they are more cunning in this matter than any other people. “Give me a drink of water,” something that costs no money. After drinking, he says, “Perhaps you have a small onion?” After he gives it to him, he says, “Is there an onion without salt?” After he gives it to him, he says, “Give me a little bread, so that the onion does not harm me.” So did David say at first concerning the inadvertent sins, and then concerning the willful sins, and afterwards concerning the rebellious sins. פשעים are rebellious sins, with which one intends to provoke, and so Scripture says (II Kings 3:7): “The king of Moab rebelled (פשע) against me.”

<b>May the Lord answer you on a day of distress</b> This psalm was [composed] because he [David] would send Joab and all Israel to war, and he would stand in Jerusalem and pray for them, as the matter is stated (in II Sam. 18:3): “It is better that you be for us from the city as aid.” Were it not for David, Joab would not have succeeded in battle.
<b>the name of the God of Jacob</b> Who promised him [Jacob] when he went to Haran and kept His promise; therefore, it is stated: “the God of Jacob.”
@3
<b>from His sanctuary</b> From His Holy Temple, in which He dwells.
@4
<b>your meal offerings...burnt offerings</b> They are the prayers that you pray in battle.
<b>fat</b> Heb. ידשנה, an expression of fat, as (in Deut. 31:20): “and it will eat and be satisfied, and it will become obese (ודשן),” i.e., He will accept them [the prayers] willingly like fat burnt offering.
@6
<b>Let us sing praises for your salvation</b> When the Holy One, blessed be He, saves you, we will all sing praises to the Holy One, blessed be He.

@8
<b>These trust in chariots</b> Some nations trust in their iron chariots, and some trust in horses, but wewe pray in the name of the Lord, because the salvation is His. נזכיר is an expression of burning sacrifices and of prayer, as (in Isa. 66:3): “he who burns (מזכיר) frankincense,” (and in Lev. 2:2): “its memorial part (אזכרתה).” Therefore, they kneel and fall...
@9
<b>but we rise and gain strength</b> We gain strength over them, as (below 147:6): “strengthens (מעודד) the humble,” an expression of strength.
#21
@2
<b>may the king rejoice with Your strength</b> Our Rabbis (Mid. Ps. 21:1) interpreted it as referring to the King Messiah, but the matter may correctly be interpreted further as referring to David himself, in order to refute the sectarians, who became bold because of it.
@3
<b>and the speech of</b> Heb. וארשת, an expression of speech, which has no similar word. Menachem (p. 167), however, brought a [word] similar to it (Ezra 3:7): “by the authorization (ברשיון) of Cyrus, king of Persia.”
@4
<b>For You have preceded him with the blessings of the good man</b> Before I asked You, You preceded me with Your blessing through Nathan the prophet (in II Sam. 7:12f.): “then I will raise up your seed...and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.”
<b>You have placed a gold crown on his head</b> (As in II Sam. 12:30): “And he took the crown of Malkam...and it was [set] upon David’s head.”
@5
<b>He asked You for life</b> As I fled outside the Holy Land from before Saul, I would pray, “May I walk before the Lord in the lands of the living” (below 116:9).
<b>You gave it to him</b> For You restored me to the land of Israel.

@6

@7
<b>You shall make him happy</b> Heb. תחדהו, an expression of חדוה, joy.
<b>before You</b> in Paradise. Our Rabbis, who interpreted it as referring to the King Messiah, brought proof on that matter (from Dan. 7: 13): “and came to the Ancient of days and brought him near before Him.” Scripture also states (in Jer. 30:21): “and I will bring him near, and he shall approach Me.”

@14
<b>Exalt Yourself, O Lord, with Your strength</b> over those who rise up [against You], and let us sing and chant.
#22
@1
<b>ayeleth hashachar</b> The name of a musical instrument. Another explanation: Concerning the nation of Israel, which is a beloved hind (אילת אהבים), who looks forth like the dawn (שחר) (Song 6:10). Our Sages, however, interpreted it as referring to Esther (Mid. Ps. 22:1, Meg. 15b). Menachem (p. 22) interprets אילת as an expression of strength, as (verse 20): “My strength (אילותי), hasten to my assistance.” השחר is an expression of dawn, but Menachem (p. 172) interprets it as an expression of seeking, as (in Prov. 11:27): “He who desires (שֹׁחֵר) good etc.” and as (ibid. 7:15) “to look (לשחר) for you.”
@2
<b>why have You forsaken me?</b> They are destined to go into exile, and David recited this prayer for the future.

@8
<b>they will open</b> Heb. יפטירו, they open, as (in Exod. 13:12, 13): “all that open (פטר) the womb,...and firstling (ופטר) of a donkey.” [Also] (in Prov. 17: 14): “like letting out (פוטר) water.”
@9

<b>You made me secure on my mother’s breast</b> You prepared breasts for a person, upon which to rely for sustenance.
@11
<b>Upon You, I was cast from birth</b> I was cast from birth since You took me out of the womb, as Scripture states (in Isa. 46:3): “who are carried from birth.” From the time the tribes were born, He carried them and led them.
@13
<b>Great bulls</b> Mighty kingdoms.
<b>the mighty ones of Bashan</b> That too is an expression of the bulls of Bashan, which are fat.
<b>encompassed me</b> Heb. כתרוני. They encompassed me like a crown (כתר), which encompasses the head.
@14
<b>a tearing lion</b> Nebuchadnezzar.
@15
<b>like wax</b> Wax, which melts from the heat of the fire.
@16
<b>my palate</b> Heb. מלקוחי. This is the palate which is called palayc (palais) in Old French, gaumen in German. When a person is distressed, he has no saliva in his mouth. Menachem, however, interprets מלקוחי as etenayles in Old French (tongs), like (Isa. 6:6): “with tongs (במלקחים) he had taken it.” And the מלקוח is the teeth, which resemble a smith’s tongs. (The quotation from Menachem appears only in the Salonika edition of Rashi printed in 1515.)
<b>and in the dust of death</b> To the crushing of death.
<b>You set me down</b> Heb. תשפתני You set me down, an expression of setting a pot, as (in Ezek. 24:3, II Kings 4:38): “set on (שפת) the pot.” Menachem (p.179) interprets every expression of שפיתה as an expression of placing.
@17
<b>like a lion, my hands and feet</b> As though they are crushed in a lion’s mouth, and so did Hezekiah say (in Isa. 38:13): “like a lion, so it would break all my bones.”
@18
<b>I tell about all my bones</b> The pain of my bones.
<b>They look</b> They rejoice at my misfortune.
@19
<b>and cast lots for my raiment</b> They plunder our property.
@20
<b>my strength</b> Heb. אילותי, my strength, as (below 88:5): “I was as a man without strength (איל),” and as (Gen. 31:29): “It is within the power (לאל) of my hand.”
@22
<b>Save me from the lion’s mouth</b> as You answered me from the horns of the wild oxen. This is the Amorite, “whose height is as the height of the cedar trees” (Amos 2:9); the thirty-one kings.
@23
<b>I will tell Your name to my brothers</b> when any of my assemblies gathers, and so I will say to them, “You who fear the Lord, praise Him.” This refers to the proselytes, and “all the seed of Jacob.”
@24
<b>and fear</b> Heb. וגורו, an expression of fear.
@25
<b>the cry of the poor</b> Every [expression of] עניה in Scripture is an expression of a cry. ענות can also be interpreted as an expression of humility, as (in Exod. 10:3): “to humble yourself (לענת),” because he (the poor man) humbles himself and prays before You.
@27
<b>The humble shall eat</b> at the time of our redemption in the days of our Messiah.
<b>your hearts shall live forever</b> I will say all this before them.
@28
<b>shall remember and return to the Lord</b> The nations shall remember the evil that befell us when they see the good and return to the Lord.
@29
<b>For the kingship is the Lord’s</b> For they will see that the kingship and the rule has returned to You.
@30
<b>They shall eat all the best of the earth and prostrate themselves</b> Lit. they shall eat and prostrate themselves all the best of the earth. This is a transposed verse. The humble shall eat all the best of the earth and prostrate themselves to the Lord with praise and thanksgiving for the good. דשני means the good, the fat of the earth. [People at] all the ends of the earth will see all this and return to the Lord.
<b>before Him shall...kneel</b> Then all the dead of nations [will kneel] from Gehinnom but He will not have mercy upon them to revive their souls from Gehinnom.
<b>his soul</b> [The soul] of each one.
<b>He will not quicken</b> Lit. He did not quicken. Our Sages (Mid. Ps. 22:32) derived from this verse that the dead, before their death, at the time their soul is taken, see the countenance of the Shechinah.
@31
<b>The seed that worships Him</b> The seed of Israel, who constantly worship Him.
<b>it shall be told to the generation concerning the Lord</b> Transpose the verse and explain it thus: It shall be told to the last generation in the name of the Lord and in His praise what He did for that seed.
@32
<b>They shall come</b> The first ones shall come and tell His righteousness to the newborn people, for He performed righteous deeds for them.
#23
@1
<b>A song of David</b> The Rabbis said: Wherever it says: “A song of David,” he would play [his musical instrument] and afterwards the Shechinah would rest on him. It is a song to bring the holy spirit upon David. And, wherever it says: “Of David, a song,” the Shechinah rested on him [first] and then he recited a song.
<b>The Lord is my shepherd</b> In this desert where I am going, [therefore] I am confident that I will lack nothing.
@2
<b>in green pasture</b> In grassy pastures. Since he commences to compare his sustenance to the pasture of an animal by saying, “The Lord is my shepherd,” “green pastures” is appropriate for the expression, “the Lord is my shepherd.” David recited this psalm in the forest of Hereth (I Sam. 22:5). Why was it called Hereth? Because it was as dry as a potsherd (חרס) and the Holy One, blessed be He, moistened it with the good of the world to come (Mid. Ps. 23:6).
@3
<b>He restores my soul</b> My spirit, which has been weakened by troubles and haste, He will restore to its previous status.
<b>in paths of righteousness</b> In straight paths, so that I should not fall into the hands of my enemies.
@4
<b>in the valley of darkness</b> Heb. צלמות, in a land of darkness. He alludes to the desert of Ziph (I Sam. 23:13 28). Every [mention of] צלמות is an expression of darkness. Dunash ben Labrat defined it [in this manner].
<b>Your rod and Your staff</b> The pains that came upon me, and the support, that I rely upon Your loving kindnessboth of them will comfort me, for they will serve to expiate my iniquity, and I am confident that You will set a table before me. That is the throne.

@4
<b>who has not taken My name in vain</b> Who has not sworn with My name and My soul in vain. We find an expression of an oath used with the soul (נפש), as it is stated (in Amos 6:8): “The Lord God swore by Himself (בנפשו).”
@6
<b>This</b> [generation,] whose deeds are such - this is the generation of those who seek him.
@7
<b>[You] gates, lift your heads</b> In the days of Solomon his son, when he comes to bring the Ark into the Holy of Holies and the gates cling to each other, he [Solomon] recited twenty-four praises, but he was not answered until he said (II Chron. 6:42): “Do not turn back the face of Your anointed; remember the kind deeds of David, Your servant.”

@8
<b>The Lord is good and upright</b> and wishes to exonerate His creatures.
<b>therefore, He leads sinners on the road</b> of repentance. Another explanation: He leads sinners, meaning murderers [who flee to the cities of refuge], as it is said (in Deut. 19:3): “You shall prepare for yourself the road, etc.” Refuge, refuge,” was written at the crossroads, etc., as is stated in Makkoth, chapter 2 (10b).

@4
<b>and to visit His Temple every morning</b> To appear there every morning. Dunash (Teshuvoth Dunash, p. 53) explained in this manner. Menachem (Machbereth Menachem, p. 47) however associated it with (Lev. 27:33), “He shall not inquire (יבקר),” but Dunash interpreted it as an expression of “morning” (בקר).
@5
<b>That He will hide me in His tabernacle</b> I am confident that He will hide me in His Temple, and we learned in Seder Olam (ch. 18) that this verse was stated concerning Joash the son of Ahaziah, who was hidden by his sister, Jehosheba, in the attic of the Holy of Holies, as the matter is stated (in II Kings 11:3): “And he was hiding with her in the house of the Lord for six years.”
<b>He will lift me up on a rock</b> He stood my feet on a rock.
@6

@8
<b>On Your behalf, my heart says, “Seek My presence.”</b> On Your behalf, as Your agent, my heart says to me, “All of you Israelites, seek My presence.” And I obey it. “Your presence, O Lord, I will seek.” [The word] לך is like (Job 33:6): “Behold I am like your mouth to God (לא-ל),” [that is,] in His stead; (ibid. 13:8), “Will you contend for God (לא-ל)?” [that is,] in His stead. Here, too, “On Your behalf, my heart says,” in Your stead, my heart comes to me to say this.
@9

@10

@12

<b>and speakers of evil</b> Heb. ויפח חמס, speakers of evil. Another explanation: An expression of a trap (פח).
@13
<b>Had I not believed in seeing, etc.</b> If I had not believed in the Holy One, blessed be He, those false witnesses would have already risen against me and destroyed me. [The word] לולא is punctuated for the homily which our Sages expounded (Ber. 4a): I know that You give reward to the righteous in the world to come, but I do not know whether I have a share with them or not.

#29
@1
<b>Prepare for the Lord</b> Heb. הבו. Prepare for the Lord and prepare for Him, you sons of the mighty of the land. From here we derive the ruling that [for the first blessing of the Amidah prayer] we should say the blessing אבות, the Patriarchs (Meg. 17b, R.H. 32b, Mid. Ps. 29:2). But Menachem (p. 68) associated הבו as an expression of giving.
<b>mighty</b> Heb. אלים, princes.
<b>prepare for the Lord glory and might</b> From here we derive that [for the second blessing of the Amidah prayer] we should say the blessing of גבורות, mighty deeds.
@2
<b>the glory due His name</b> This is the blessing of the sanctity of the Name [the third blessing of the Amidah]. In this psalm, there are eighteen mentions of God’s name, and corresponding to them, they instituted eighteen blessings.
@3
<b>The voice of the Lord is upon the waters</b> Upon the Sea of Reeds, “The Lord thundered from heaven” (above 18:14).
<b>thunders</b> Heb. הרעים, tormanta in Old French.
@4
<b>The voice of the Lord is in strength</b> At the time of the giving of the Torah, He moderated His voice according to the strength of Israel, as it is said (Exod. 19:19): “and God would answer him with a voice,” with Moses’ voice.
@5
<b>The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars</b> The kings of the nations, as the matter that is written (in I Sam. 7:10): “and the Lord thundered with a loud noise etc. upon the Philistines”; (in Isa. 30:31): “For from the Lord’s voice Assyria shall be broken.” And at the time of the giving of the Torah (Deut. 5: 23): “For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speak out of the fire as we have and remained alive?” You heard and remained alive, but the nations of the world would hear it and die.

<b>He causes them to dance like a calf</b> The cedars and the mountains that came to hear the giving of the Torah.
<b>Lebanon and Sirion</b> The names of mountains.
@7

@8
<b>causes the desert to quake</b> Heb. יחיל, an expression of (Jer. 6:24), “pain (חיל) as a woman in travail.”
<b>the Lord causes the desert of Kadesh to quake</b> That is the desert of Sinai, as our Sages said in Tractate Shabbath (89a): It was called by five names: the desert of Sinai, the desert of Zin, the desert of Kadesh, the desert of Kedemoth, the desert of Paran. [It was called] the desert of Kadesh because Israel was sanctified on its account.
@9
<b>The voice of the Lord will frighten the hinds</b> In the future, it will frighten the nations of the world and cause [them] to quake, those who are now standing firmly like hinds, as the matter that is stated (above 18:34): “He makes my feet like hinds.” Said Rabbi Phinehas: It does not say, “like harts,” but “like hinds,” like the females, because the feet of the females stand straighter than those of the males (Mid. Ps. 22:1). Another explanation: יחולל is kria in Old French, to create, as (in Prov. 8: 25), “before the hills, I was created (חוללתי).”
<b>and strip the forests</b> Like (Gen. 30:37), “by uncovering (מחשף) the white.” He will strip the forest trees, i.e., he will strip the nations, compared to forest trees, of their glory, as is stated (in Amos 2:9): “whose height is as the height of the cedar trees.”
<b>and in His Temple</b> which will be built.
<b>everyone speaks of His glory</b> Everyone will praise Him there and say...
@10
<b>The Lord sat [enthroned] at the flood</b> alone in His greatness, and now also, the Lord sits alone forever, “but the idols will completely pass away,” (as in Isa. 2:18), yet to His people He will give strength and a blessing of peace. Our Sages, however, expounded upon it in Midrash Psalms (29:2) that the nations became frightened and startled, and they came to Balaam and said to him, “What is the sound of the stirring that we heard? Is He going to bring a flood upon the world?” He replied to them, “He already swore that He would not bring a flood. Rather, the sound of the stirring that you heard is that the Holy One, blessed be He, is giving a Torah to His people.”

<b>and You have not allowed my enemies to rejoice over me</b> Heb. לי, like עלי, over me, for they would say, “David has no share in the world to come,” but when they saw that the doors opened for the Ark because of me, then they knew that the Holy One, blessed be He, had forgiven me for that sin, and the faces of David’s enemies became as black as the bottom of a pot.

<b>and I said in my tranquility</b> Haman said this.

Dunash (pp. 17f.) however, interpreted it as an expression of a great and strong thing, as (in Job 21:7): “grow strong (עתקו) and powerfully rich”; (Prov. 8:18), “powerful (עתק) wealth”; (Isa. 23:18), “and for stately (עתקו) clothing.”

<b>have been shot</b> Heb. נחתו, have been cast. The expression of נחת applies to the bending of a bow, and since the arrows are shot by bending the bow, he wrote נחתו בי [literally] “were bent in me.” Similarly, (in Exod. 15:9): “I will unsheath my sword (אריק חרבי),” [lit. I emptied my sword.] The Torah should have written: אריק תערי, I will empty my sheath, but because when they draw the sword from its sheath, the sheath is emptied of it, he therefore relates the emptying to the sword. Similarly, (above 18:35): “a copper bow was bent (ונחתה).” The “nun” is not a radical, because, if it were a radical, it would have to be ננחתו, but the “nun” of נחתו, and so ותנחת, is not a radical but is sometimes dropped, like the “nun” of נגף, to smite; נשך, to bite; נדר, to vow; נקם, to avenge. And when it is passive we say: נִגַּף, smitten; נִִִשַׁךְ, bitten; נִדַּר, vowed; נִקַּם, avenged, like נִנְקַם, נִנְדַּר, נִנְשַׁךְ, נִנְגַּף. The “dagesh” in the word replaces the “nun.” Similarly (in Lev. 26:36), a rattling (נִדַף) leaf,” (in Lam. 3:49), “My eyes stream (נִגְרָה),” like נִנְגְּרָה. So does he say נִחֲתוּ like נִנְחֲתוּ, and so (above 18:35): “and a copper bow was bent (וְנִּחֲתָה),” like וְנִנְחֲתָה. It was customary for the “cheth” to be treated like the letters that do accept a “dagesh” in most places, e.g. (in I Kings 13:18): “He lied (כִּחֶשׁ) to him,” in the form that is punctuated by a “dagesh,” [i.e., the pi’el conjugation,] like דִבֶּר spoke, from the same conjugation as וַיְדַבֶּר, כִּחֶשׁ from the same conjugation as (Gen. 18: 15): “And Sarah lied (וַתְּכַחֵשׁ),” and we do not say כֵּחַשׁ as we say from הַמְבָרֵךְ, בֵּרַךְ and we do not say בִּרֵךְ as we say דִּבֵּר, because the power of the “dagesh”; is not recognizable in the “resh,” but in the “cheth” the power of the “dagesh” is recognizable, and so (in Deut. 32:5): “Have they injured (שִׁחֵת) Him?” like כִּפֵר, atoned, דִּבֵּר, spoke. Here, too, he says, נִחֲתוּ like נִגְּשׁוּ they approached, נִתְּנוּ, they were given, from the roots נחת, נגש, נתן, the “nun” being a defective radical, replaced by a “dagesh” in the passive voice. So is (I Sam. 2: 4): “The bows of the mighty are broken (חתים),” from the root נחת and חתת as you say from נסב, סבב, from נשם, שמם ; (Lev. 26:22), “and your ways shall become desolate (וְנָשַׁמוּ),” (ibid. verse 32), “shall wonder (וְשָׁמְמוּ) over it.” Similarly, בָּלַל, נָבֹל, (Gen. 11:9) “for there the Lord confused בָּלַל” (ibid. verse 7) “and let us confuse (וְנָבְלָה) their language there.” So does he say נחת and חתת in the active voice.
<b>and Your hand has come down upon me</b> This is the explanation of “Your arrows have been shot into me.” And this is its interpretation: What bent the bow to shoot the arrows? Your hand has come down upon the bow to shoot arrows at me. ותנחת is an expression of ותרד, it came down, and in this the “nun” is a radical. Similarly (18:35), “and a copper bow was broken (ונחתה),” in which the “nun” is not a radical.

We also were silent from “good,” even from words of Torah, because of their fear of them, our pain was so intense and frightening. When we were silent, our heart was hot within us and in the thought of our heart it burns in us like fire. That causes us to speak with our tongue (in silencenot in all editions) before You, and this is what we say, “O Lord, let us know our end.” How long will we be in distress, and let us know when we will be over it.

@11
<b>from the fear of Your hand</b> Heb. מתגרת, from the fear of Your blows. תגרת is an expression of (Num. 22:3): “And Moab became terrified (וַיָגָר).” The “tav” is a defective radical in the word, like תנובה, produce; תלונה, complaint; תקומה, restoration; תכונה, characteristic. This is how Menachem explained it, but I maintain that תגרת is not an expression of מָגוֹר, fear, because he should have said תגוּרה as he says from: וישב (and he returned) תשוּבה, [from] ויקם, וירם and וילן: תקוּמה, תרוּמה and תלוּנה, so he should say from ויגר, תגוּלה, or מגוּרה as (above 31:14, Jer. 20:3): “terror (מגור) from all sides”; (Isa. 66:4) “and their fears (ומגורתם) I will bring.” Thus you learn that מתגרת is nothing but as (II Chron. 25:19), “Why should you provoke (תתגרה) disaster?”; (Deut. 2:5), “Do not provoke (תתגרו) them,” in which case the verb is גרה like קוה, to hope; אוה, to desire; צוה, to command, of which the noun is תקוה, תאוה, מצוה. So one says from גרה, תגרה, and this is its explanation: from the blows of Your hand, with which You fight me, I perish.

[Then] they ascended from there, and the holy spirit rested on them, whereupon they prophesied concerning the exiles, the destruction of the Temple, and the Davidic dynasty.
@2
<b>As a hart cries longingly for rivulets</b> Heb. תערג. The expression of ערג applies to the voice of the hart as the expression of נהם, roaring, applies to a lion; שּׁקוק, growling, to a bear; געה, lowing, to oxen, and צפצוף chirping, to birds. [See Teshuvoth Dunash, p. 18.] Our Sages said: The hind is the most pious of the beasts. When the beasts are thirsty for water, they gather to her so that she should raise her eyes to heaven. And what does she do? She digs a pit and thrusts her antlers into it and lows. Thereupon, the Holy One, blessed be He, has compassion on her and the deep brings up water for her.
<b>As a hart cries longingly</b> “As a hind cries longingly” is not stated, nor, “As a hart cries longingly (יערג) [in the masculine].” Only, “As a hart cries longingly.” Scripture speaks of [both] a male and a female. The male cries longingly for water, as we explained, and the female when she kneels to give birth, [because] her womb is narrow. [When] she cries out, the Holy One, blessed be He, is compassionate and prepares a serpent, which bites her on her birth canal, whereupon her womb opens. Menachem (p. 138) connects תערג with (Song 5:13): “His cheeks are like a bed of (כערוגת) spice,” but his view is impossible. Dunash (p. 18) too explained it as the sound of the hart.

<b>when will I come and appear before God?</b> to make the pilgrimages on the festivals.

<b>These things I will remember, etc., how I passed on with the throng</b> Pasoye in Old French. I remember this, and my soul pours out when I remember the festive pilgrimage, how I would pass on with the throngs of people and walk slowly with them until the House of God. סַךְ is an expression of a number. Another explanation: סַךְ is an expression of a human barrier. Another explanation: סַךְ is an expression of a covering and a booth, meaning covered wagons. סַךְ is an expression relating to צָב (Num. 7:3), “covered wagons” (עגלותצב). Covered like a booth, their name in the language of the Aggadah is סקפסטאות and אסקופיטי.
<b>I walked slowly with them</b> I walked slowly with them, as (Shab. 128b): “We may make calves and foals walk (מדדים),” and, “A woman may make her child walk (מדדה). This word serves in place of two words: אדדה עמהם, I walked with them, etay amut semble in Old French, to move together. Menachem (p. 62) associated it as an expression of affection (ידידות), as (Jer. 12:7): “I have delivered My soul’s beloved (ידידות) into the hand of her enemies.” But Dunash (p. 27) interpreted אדדם as an expression of silence (דממה), and likewise (above 37:7): “Wait (דום) for the Lord, etc.” Accordingly, the interpretation of אדדם is: “I will be dumb,” and I was silent until I came to the House of God with shouts of joy, as (above 39:2): “I will guard my mouth [as though with] a muzzle, etc.” and as (above 38:14): “But I am like a deaf man, I do not hear, and like a mute, etc.” דם is the radical of אדדם I would walk with them, as (Gen. 37:4): “And they could not speak with him in peace,” [equivalent to] לדבר עמו בשלום.
<b>a celebrating multitude</b> who were going to celebrate, and on this the liturgical poet (in the morning service of Parashat Shekalim, in the Yotzer of [the prayer] “Ayleh Ezcherah”): “A vast celebrating multitude, flooding like a river.” According to the Midrash Aggadah (Mid. Ps. 42:4), it is Greek, because they call a pool of water “chogegin.”
@6
<b>are you downcast</b> Heb. תשתוחחי, an expression of (below 44:26): “For our soul is cast down (שחה) to the dust.” When שַּׁח is used in the reflexive (מתפעל), the “tav” separates the radicals in the manner of every word whose root begins with “shin.”

All these I remember in my exile, when You have refrained from doing good for me, and Your decrees are being renewed one after the other.

<b>Deep calls to deep</b> One trouble calls the next one.
<b>to the sound of Your water channels</b> (Tes canals in Old French, canaux in modern French) which spray retribution upon me like flooding waters, until all Your breakers and waves have passed over me. “Your breakers” is an expression of the waves of the sea, because the waves of the sea ascend, break, and fall.

<b>By day, may the Lord command His kindness</b> May the light of the redemption come, and may the Lord command His kindness to us.

<b>may His resting place be with me</b> Heb. שירה. May His resting place be in our midst. שּׁירה is an expression of camping, as we translate (II Sam. 17:26): “And Israel encamped,” וּשְּׁרָא. I learned this from the Great Masorah, which associates this [word] with (I Kings 5:12): “And his songs (שירו) were a thousand and five,” in the “aleph-beth” of two words with different meanings (homonyms). This taught [me] that this is not an expression of song, but the Midrash Aggadah does interpret it as an expression of song, interpreting in this manner: Israel says to the Holy One, blessed be He: “We remember what You did for us in Egypt. You commanded us one commandment by day on the eve of the Passover, and we observed it, and at night, You redeemed us and we sang Hallel before You. But now we keep many commandments, yet You do not redeem us. Because of this, I will say to God, my Rock, ‘Why have You forgotten me?’ “

<b>His waters shall stir and be muddied</b> Heb. יחמרו, they shall cast up mud, clay (חמר), and dirt as is their wont. Menachem (pp. 90f.), however, associated it with (Lam. 1:20), “my reins have shriveled (חמרמרו),” regrezeliront in Old French, have shriveled.

@3
<b>The fairest of branches</b> Heb. יפר נוף, a city that is a fair branch; an expression of the branches (נוף) of a tree. Another explanation: A fair bride, for in the coastal cities they call a bride ninfe (nymphe in Greek) (R. H. 26a). Menachem (p. 124) associated it with (Josh. 17:11) “the three regions (הנפת)” (i. e., there [on Joshua] he explains that it means regions; as Rashi explains there: contree in French, a region. In this manner, Rashi explains in Joshua 11:3,) but Dunash (p. 34) defined it as an expression of a branch of a tree, and Mt. Zion was called “the fairest of branches” because it is (near—Shem Ephraim) the Mount of Olives.
<b>the joy of the entire earth</b> Now what is its joy? The north side, angles in French, angle, corner. Redak (Shorashim) also defines it as corners, and so in Ezekiel (46:21). The northern side of the altar [was] where sin offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered, and whoever was grieved because of the sins he had committed would bring a sin offering or a guilt offering, and he would be forgiven. He would then emerge happy, and the sacrifices would benefit the entire world.

<b>With an east wind</b> That is an expression of retribution, with which the Holy One, blessed be He, recompenses the wicked, as it is stated (Exod. 14:21): “and the Lord led the sea with a strong east wind, etc.” Similarly (Ezek. 16:27, 26): “The east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas”; (Jer. 18:17), “Like an east wind, I will scatter you before the enemy.”

<b>We have hoped, O Lord, for Your kindness</b> The prophet repeatedly prays to the Holy One, blessed be He, and says, “We hoped and waited for Your kindness, to see this Your salvation in the midst of Your Temple. Menachem (p. 65) interpreted it as an expression of thought, as (Esther 4: 13): “Do not think (אל תדמי).”

<b>Hear this, all you peoples</b> Because this psalm is based on people who rely on their riches, he says, “all you peoples,” for they all require admonition.
<b>earth</b> Heb. חלוד. That [term] is [used to describe] the earth because it is old and rusty (חלודה), rodile in Old French, rust, rouille in modern French. But our Sages explained that it is because of the weasel (חֻלְדָה), which frequents the dry land but is not found in the sea, for the Rabbis taught (Hul. 127a): Whatever is on the dry land is found in the sea, except the weasel.

Because the iniquity of my heels surrounds me. The iniquities that I tread with my heels, that I treat lightly, that I view as minor sinsthey condemn me in judgment, and surely the wealthy.

@9
<b>will be too dear</b> that he will live forever and not see the Pit. Menachem (p. 158) associated it as an expression of withholding, as (Isa. 13:12): “I will make mortal man dearer (אוקיר) than fine gold”; (Lev. 26:21), “I will go with them with wrath of withdrawal (קיר)” i.e., the ransom of their soul will be withheld.
@11
<b>For he sees that wise men die</b> and are not saved from death. So, perforce, he stops wearying himself and toiling for his brother’s ransom.
<b>their possessions</b> Heb. חילם, their money. Death is mentioned in reference to the wise men, because in this world they die only in the body, whereas concerning the fool and the boorish man, perishing is mentioned, because both body and soul perish.
@12
<b>In their heart, their houses are forever</b> Their thoughts are to build for themselves houses that will exist forever.

@14
<b>folly</b> Heb. כסל, madness.
<b>and after them they will tell with their mouth forever</b> And those who come after them will speak of them and tell with their mouth what happened to the earlier ones.
<b>will tell</b> Heb. ירצו, an expression of narration, retreyront in Old French, But our Sages (Shab. 32b) explained: This is the way of the wicked: they perish in the end but כֶסֶל is theirs. They have fat on their flanks (כסליהם), which covers their kidneys, and they [their kidneys] do not advise them to repent of their evil. Perhaps you will say that it is forgetfulness, that they have forgotten that ultimately they will die? Scripture therefore states: and their end they tell with their mouth; i.e., the day of their end is constantly in their mouth and they are not afraid of it.
@15
<b>Like sheep, they are destined to the grave</b> Like sheep that are gathered to the shed, so are they into the grave.
<b>they are destined</b> Heb. שתו. The “tav” is punctuated with a “dagesh,” in place of the second “tav.” שּׁוֹתתוּ into the midst of the foundations (שתותיה) of the nether world, to the lowest level. Likewise (above 73:9): “They have set their mouth against heaven,” is also an expression of foundations; they set their mouth in heaven; their slander.
<b>death will devour them</b> Heb. ירעם. The angel of death will devour them. Do not wonder about this expression of eating because we find elsewhere (Job 18:13): “the prince of death shall devour his branches.” Another explanation: [It is] an expression of breaking, as (Jer. 15:12): “Will iron break (הירע)?”
<b>and the upright will rule over them in the morning</b> On the day of the redemption, when the morning of Israel shines, they will rule over them, as it is stated (Malachi 3:21): “And You shall crush the wicked, etc.”
<b>and their form will outlast the grave</b> The form of the wicked will outlast the grave. Gehinnom will end, but they will not end.
<b>as his dwelling place</b> From being a dwelling place for them. And the Holy One, blessed be He, takes the sun out of its case, and it will burn them up, as it is stated (Mal. 3:19, Ned. 8b). Our Sages, however, explained מִזְבֻל לוֹ to mean that because they stretched out their hand on His dwelling place, they destroyed the Temple (Mid. Ps. 49:3).
@16
<b>But God will redeem my soul</b> But I, who have bent my ear to the parable—God will redeem my soul so that I do not go to the grave, because He will take me in my lifetime to go in His ways.

@10
<b>the behemoth of the thousand mountains</b> That is (the bull) destined for the future feast [of the righteous], which grazes on a thousand mountains daily, and every day they grow back. Others explain this to mean one thousand mountains or one thousand parasangs (i.e., one mountain that is 1,000 parasangs long, or perhaps it should read: 1,000 bulls. The plural “mountains” indicates that there were many mountains of that type.[Shem Ephraim]) Others explain that this is like (Deut. 7:13): “the litter of your cattle (אלפיך).” i.e., mountains full of cattle, because he says, “I will not take from your household a bull.”

@6
<b>Against You alone have I sinned</b> Therefore, it is in Your power to forgive [me]. Even in my sin against Uriah, I sinned against You, for You warned against the matter.
<b>in order that You be justified in Your conduct</b> like במנהגך, in Your conduct. I had the strength to overpower my evil inclination, but, so that they should not say, “The servant overpowered his master,”for I said to You (Ps. 26: 2), “Test me, O Lord, and try me,” and You tested me and I was not found perfect, in order that You should be justified and not I (Sanh. 107a). Another explanation:
<b>in order that You be justified in Your conduct</b> If You forgive me, You will be justified in Your judgment against all the wicked who do not repent, so that they will not be able to say, “If we had repented, it would not have availed us.”
@7
<b>Behold, with iniquity I was formed</b> Now how could I not sin when the main part of my creation was through coitus, the source of many iniquities? Another explanation: The main part of my creation is from a male and a female, both of whom are full of iniquity. There are many midrashim to this verse, but they do not fit the context of the psalm.
<b>conceived me</b> Heb. יחמתני, an expression of heat, as (Gen. 30:38): “And they came into heat (ויחמנה) when they came to drink.”
@8
<b>Behold, You desired that truth be in the hidden places</b> and behold, I confess to the truth, that I sinned.
<b>in the hidden places</b> Heb. בטחות. These are the reins, which are smooth. Menachem (p. 97), however, associated it with (Gen. 21:16): “as it were a bowshot (כמטחוי קשת)”; and so (Job 38: 36): “Who placed wisdom in the inward parts (בטחות).” And their interpretation is an expression of drawing, for just as a bow is drawn, so is their yearning for knowledge.

@2
<b>The fool said in his heart</b> This is Titus; when he cut into the curtain and his sword was dripping with blood, he said that he had killed [God] Himself.

@6
<b>there was never such fear</b> This fear was not like the first fear that came over Belshazzar, for in this redemption the Holy One, blessed be He, scattered the bones of חוֹנָךְ, those who camp around you, Jerusalem, as the matter that is stated (Zech. 14:12): “His flesh will waste away, etc.” Menachem (p. 91) interpreted it that way, but Dunash (pp. 63f.) interpreted it as (Prov. 22:6): “Train (חנך) a child according to his way”; the “chaph” of חוֹנָךְ is a radical as the “chaph” of חֲנֹךְ, train.

@7
<b>to those who lie in wait for me</b> Heb. לשררי, those who eye me, an expression of (Num. 24:17): “I see him (אשורנו), but not near.”

#55
@3
<b>I lament in my speech</b> Heb. אריד, I will lament of my pain, as (Lam. 3:19): “Remember my affliction and my misery (ומרודי).” Also (Jud. 11:37): “and wail (וירדתי) upon the mountains.” Menachem (p. 162) interpreted אריד as an expression of ruling, as (Gen. 1:28): “and rule (ורדו) over the fish of the sea.” שּׂיחי is an expression of speech (Prov. 23:29): “He who talks too much (שיח).”
@4
<b>the distress</b> Heb. עקת, an expression of distress.
<b>for they accuse me of iniquity</b> Doeg and Ahithophel accuse me of iniquities that overweigh [the scale] to demonstrate that I am liable to death, and they sanction [the shedding of] my blood.
@5
<b>shudders</b> Heb. יחיל, worries.
@8
<b>Behold I would wander far away...</b> and...
@9
<b>I would quickly find myself a refuge</b> If I had wings, I would wander far away and hasten to save my soul from their hands, for they are like a sweeping wind, a storm wind, which uproots trees, as (Job 19:10): “He has uprooted (ויסע) like a tree.” But Menachem (p. 127) associated it with (Exod.12: 37): “And the children of Israel traveled (ויסעו).
@10
<b>divide their tongue</b> Divide it so that no one should pay them heed. And Menachem (p. 142) interpreted פלג as an expression of division.
<b>Destroy</b> (Defey or defay in Old French, destroy, defais in modern French,) like (Lam. 2:8): “He did not restrain his hand from destroying (מבלע).” So did Menachem interpret it [p. 46].

<b>For no enemy reviled me</b> all my life that I should bear my vilification, but I rose up against him and slew him.
<b>my enemy did not open his mouth</b> that I should flee and hide from him, but now I bear the abuse with which you reviled me because you are a man who is great in Torah.
@14
<b>a man of my equal</b> A man as important as I.
<b>and my esteemed one</b> Heb. ומידעי, like אלוּפי, my prince, an expression of (Exod. 33:17): “and I recognized you (ואדעך),” which is translated וְרַבִּיתָךְ “and I made you great.” Menachem (p. 94), however, explained that “For no enemy would revile me that I should bear” is connected to (verse 7): “If only I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.” If I could raise my wings, I would fly away and wander on account of the distress of the wicked [inflicted upon me], for when I would leave the midst of the assembly of the profligate to lodge in the desert forever, then no enemy would revile me; I would not [have to] bear my disgrace and my shame, and I would not hide from him as I hid from them when I was among them. However, this interpretation is impossible, because of the verses following it, namely: And you are a man of my equal, my prince, and my esteemed one (verse 14); that together we would devise counsel; in the house of God we would walk with a multitude (verse 15). Therefore, Dunash (p. 94) interprets it in another manner, and this is its interpretation: For it is not an enemy who reviles me that I should bear my abuse, and it is not my enemy who opens his mouth wide against me, but my prince and my esteemed one, that together we would take counsel; in the house of God we would walk with a multitude. This thing is known, that the abuse of a friend is harder for a person [to bear] than the abuse of an enemy. Moreover, one can hide from his enemy, but one cannot hide from his friend when he tells him all that is in his heart. The context corroborates this [interpretation].
@15
<b>That together</b> we used to devise counsel in the Torah and in the house of God we would walk בְרָגֶשּׁ, with a multitude.
<b>in the house of God</b> In the study-halls.

<b>a mole</b> Heb. נפל אשת, talpe in Old French, which has no eyes. It is identified as תִּנְשֶׁמֶת (in Lev. 11:30), translated [by Onkelos] as אשותא. So did our Sages explain it (M.K. 6b). Others explain it as a stillbirth of a woman. אשת is like (Ezek. 23:44): “women of (אשת) lewdness.” There is a “tav” without the construct state, as (Prov. 4:9): “she will transmit to you, a crown of glory (עטרת תפארת),” like “a stillbirth of a woman (אשה),” for the stillbirths born did not see the sun. According to the former explanation, it is like נפל ואשת, a stillbirth and a mole, as (Jer. 11:19): “And I was like a lamb a bull (ככבש אלוף),” which Menachem explained: like a lamb and a bull (ככבש ואלוף). That is, a bull; here too, a stillbirth and a mole נפל ואשת. It is proper to emend.

<b>on shushan eduth, a michtam of David, to teach</b> (Addendum: Michtam is an expression of (Song 5: 11), “as finest gold (כתם פז),” a coveted thing. Our Sages, however, expounded this as referring to David, who behaved as a humble (מך) and innocent man, even when he occupied the throne. Another Aggadah explains that his wound (מכתו) was perfect (תמה), i.e., he was born circumcised (Sotah 10b). Michtam of David concerning the testimony of the Sanhedrin, who were compared to a rose (שושן), as it is stated (Song 7:3): “Your navel is like a round basin, etc., fenced in with roses,” when he required that they teach him what to do. When he fought with Aram Naharaim and sent Joab against them, they said to Joab, “Aren’t you of the sons of Jacob? Where is the oath that he swore to Laban, ‘this pile is a witness’” (Gen. 31:52)? And he did not know what to answer. He came to David and said to David, “This is what the Arameans said to me.” They went and asked the Sanhedrin, [who] replied to them, “Did they not transgress the oath first, as it is stated (Num. 23:7): ‘From Aram has Balak king of Moab brought me’? Moreover, Cushan-Rishathaim was an Aramean.”

In the works of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan, he explains it as an expression of tearing and cites evidence for that assertion (from Jer. 22:14): “And he cuts out windows,” which Jonathan translates, וּפצים. But I say that וּפצים, as Jonathan translated, is an expression of the construction of a window, as “all the entrances that have door frames (פצימין).”

But it appears to me that it should be interpreted as an expression of הַוּוֹת destruction, and the “hey” and “tav” are the radical. As one says from מֵת, מוֹת, so shall we say from the root הֵת, הוֹת, and the plural is הוּוֹת. It is an expression of a destructive and deceitful plot. Others explain תְּהוֹתֲתוּ as “you extend.” i.e., you extend your tongue on the sons of men with evil, and they compared it to Arabic, when one speaks overly much.

Now, from which statement do we derive this? From the second commandment of the Decalogue. We derive from it that the Holy One, blessed be He, punishes iniquity and preserves kindness, as it is stated therein: “I visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, etc.” Therefore, I am confident that He will pay a good reward to the righteous and punishment to the wicked. I learned from the work of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan, but our Sages interpreted it as referring to [the maxim that] “Remember” and “Keep” were stated in a single utterance.
@13

That You repay a man according to his deed; not really his deed but part of it, as the matter that is stated (Ezra 9:13): “for You, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities [deserve].” In this manner it is interpreted in Aggadath Tehillim (Mid.

As was said to Hezekiah (Isa. 39:7): “And they shall take [some] of your sons, etc., whom you shall beget, and they shall be officers in the palace of the king of Babylon.” These are Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.

<b>Silence is praise to You</b> Silence is praise to You; because there is no end to Your praise, the more one praises, the more one detracts.
<b>O God in Zion</b> God, Who dwells in Zion. [I found the following:
<b>make glorious His praise</b> Not effusion, but silence is praise. It appears that דמיה means “praise God with awe,” with the expression “praise Ya-h.” The name consisting of two letters is translated (Exod. 15:2) as, the fear of God, for “My strength and my praise is God (י-ה).” Also (Exod. 17:16), “For a hand is on the throne of God (י-ה).” And the expression (above 2:11): “and rejoice with quaking” resembles this. Shem Ephraim comments: It appears to me that Rashi should read as follows:
<b>Make glorious, etc.</b> But silence to God is praise, and its interpretation is: Praise Him with awe, etc.” The intention is that the word דמיה is divided into two words. For it was difficult for him to understand why it should appear that one is to recite any praise of the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore he says, “Make glorious His praise,” but not excessively, for that is equivalent to detracting. Therefore he says, “To You is silence (דום),” meaning that silence is fitting, but י-ה is praise, i.e., with the name consisting of two letters. His statement that the expression, “rejoice with quaking” resembles this, should read: “Worship the Lord with awe and rejoice with quaking.” His intention is that both verses mean that one may worship the Lord with awe; that is, one may worship the Holy One, blessed be He, with the name י-ה. Otherwise, worship with love is superior. It is also possible that the reading, “and it appears that, etc.” is a copyist’s error. It should read instead: “But be silent and praise Him with the name י-ה, in the expression Hallelujah. But this needs study. Later I found (below 68:5) that Rashi writes something similar. There, for him to write that the expression “and rejoice with quaking” resembles this is more appropriate, because there it says: “and rejoice before Him.” Compare. Therefore, it appears to me that this entire statement was erroneously copied here.) The gloss belongs below 66:2.] Another explanation:
<b>To You is silence praise, O God, in Zion</b> That You were silent and still concerning Your enemies’ deeds in Zion is praise to You, for You are able to take revenge, yet You are slow to anger.

<b>by His name Yah</b> By the name י-ה, which is an expression of fear, as we translate it דחילא, fear (below 118:14): “My might and my praise is the fear of the Lord (י-ה).” Likewise (Exod. 17:16): “For a hand is on the throne of the Lord (י-ה),” in the Targum: [And he said, “This is stated with an oath from below the fear of the Shechinah on the throne of His glory, etc.] Similarly (Isa. 26:4): “for in Yah the Lord,” is paraphrased by the Targum: for then You will be redeemed by the word of the fear of the Lord, the Strongest of the world.” The Psalmist says, “Praise Him, fear Him, and rejoice.” This resembles what is said elsewhere (above 2:11): “and rejoice with quaking.”

@11
<b>Your congregation dwelt therein</b> Heb. (חיתך). Your congregation has dwelt therein, as (II Sam. 23:11): “and the Philistines gathered together their camp (sic) into a troop (לחיה).” Another explanation: The congregation of Israel is known as the animal and the beast of the Holy One, blessed be He.

They will wander and be cast out of the land of Israel, and the congregation of Israel, who is the dweller of the house, will divide their spoils, as it is said (Isa. 23:18): “And her commerce and her hire shall be holy, etc.”
@14
<b>If you lie between the borders, etc.</b> All this is the word. He says to them, “If you had lain between your borders and had enjoyed pleasures, this My dove, My congregation, whose feathers are covered with silver.” Now what is the silver, and what is the gold?

<b>the feathers of a dove</b> Plumes in French.
<b>and its pinions</b> Its wings, with which it flies.
<b>with brilliant gold</b> Heb. בירקרק חרוץ. Dunash the son of Labrat interpreted חרוּץ as gold. Therefore, the Psalmist juxtaposed it to silver, and ירקרק חרוץ is the gold brought from the land of Havilah and from the land of Cush; very good gold, neither yellow nor red. Therefore, it is called ירקרק, as (Lev. 13:42): “reddish white (לבן אדמדם),” which is neither white nor red. Therefore, it is doubled: אדמדם, ירקרק.
@15
<b>kings</b> These are the Torah scholars, as it is said (Prov. 8:15): “Kings reign with me.”

@17
<b>Why do you lurk, you lofty mountains</b> All this refers back to “The Lord will give out a word.” He says further to them, “Why do you lurk (תרצדון), you lofty mountains?” Why do you lurk, you lofty mountains, to destroy the mountain that God desired for His dwelling, to cause His Shechinah to rest upon it? That is the Temple Mount. Even He will dwell there forever. Its sanctity is a perpetual sanctity. After it was chosen for His dwelling, the Shechinah did not rest elsewhere. I saw in the works of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan that רצד is “ambush” in Arabic. But Menachem (p. 166) explained תרצדוּן like תרקדוּן, you prance. That expression, too, fits the context.
@18
<b>God’s chariot, etc.</b> This too refers back to the “The Lord will give forth a word,” to mention the love of His people. Even when God’s chariot of “twice ten thousand times thousands of” brilliant “sharpened” angels appeared, and the Lord was among them at Sinai with His holiness, there too, you, the leader of His people, Moses the son of Amram ascended on high and took captives.

<b>In order that your foot may wade through blood</b> When He crushes the head of the enemy, our feet will wade through their blood. תִּמְחַץ is an expression of splitting into the blood, as (Jud. 5: 26): “she split (ומחצה) and penetrated his temple,” like בָּקְעָה, she split. This is Mishnaic Hebrew: “and the pilgrims were wading (בוקעים) up to their knees in blood.” Another explanation: תִּמְחַץ The name of a vessel with which they draw wine from the pit is called מַחַץ, in Tractate Avodah Zarah (72b).
<b>from the enemies</b> From the blood of the enemies.
<b>will have its portion</b> Heb. מנהו, its sustenance will be, as we say (Suc. 39b): “How do we know that מן is an expression of food?” For it is written (Dan. 1: 10): “who appointed (מנה) your food, etc.”

<b>There Benjamin</b> the youngest became the ruler over them.

<b>the princes of Judah pelt them with stones</b> They envy them and throw stones at them, and so do the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naftali. So, he says to him, “Your God has commanded your strength.” Another explanation: רִגְמָתָם is the equivalent of רִקְמָתָם, their embroidery, their embroidered garments, an expression of purple (ארגמן). In this way Menachem associated it (p. 161).

<b>You are feared, O God, from Your Sanctuary</b> Because You destroyed it, You are feared. If He did not show favoritism to His [own] Sanctuary, surely [He will] not [show favoritism] to the wicked of the heathens. The Midrash Aggadah explains: Do not read: מִמִּקְדָּשֶׁיךָ, “from Your Sanctuaries,” but מִמְּקֻדְּשֶׁיךָ, “from Your hallowed ones.” When the Holy One, blessed be He, executes justice upon the righteous, He is feared, elevated, and praised. Similarly, it is said (Lev. 10:3): “Through those near to me I will be sanctified.” [Also] (Exod. 29:43), “and it will be sanctified with My honor” [i.e., with My honored ones]. With the death of Aaron’s two sons (Zev. 115b). Our Rabbis, however, expounded on the entire psalm until (verse 20): “Blessed is the Lord; every day” as referring to the giving of the Torah; (verse 10) “generous rain” refers to the giving of the Torah, and (verse 11) “Your congregation dwelt therein,” means that they became engrossed in Torah (Mid. Ps. 68 with variations). But as for me I feel uncertain in explaining the expression ישבוּ as meaning that they became engrossed in Torah. Also, my heart is uneasy at explaining (verse 17) “the mountain that God desired for His dwelling” as referring to Mt. Sinai, because He did not desire it for His dwelling and [did] not [want] to dwell there forever, whereas here it is written: “Even the Lord will dwell there forever.” Likewise (verse 13): “Kings (מלכי) of hosts,” he explained as “angels (מלאכי) of hosts,” which is not the language of Scripture.

Now if you ask how this “aleph” serves as a radical and also as a prefix denoting the first person, this is the way of a word beginning with “aleph.” For example, (Mal. 1:2): “and I loved (וָאֹהַב) Jacob”; (Prov. 8:17), “I will love (אֵהָב) those who love me.” It is equivalent to וָאֶאֶהַב Similarly, (Zeph. 1:2): “I will totally destroy (אָסֹף אָסֵף),” like אֶאֶסֹף.

<b>of David, to make mention</b> This is an expression of prayer, as (above 20:8): “but we pray (נזכיר) in the name of the Lord our God.” Similarly, in (I) Chronicles (16:4): “to invoke (להזכיר) and to give thanks to the Lord.” In Midrash Psalms (70:1) I saw: This is comparable to a king who became wroth with his flock, and demolished the sheepcote and took out the flock and the shepherd. Sometime later, he restored the flock and rebuilt the sheepcote, but he did not mention the shepherd. Said the shepherd, “Behold, the flock is restored and the sheepcote is rebuilt, but I am not mentioned.” Similarly, in the preceding chapter it says: “When God saves Zion, etc., and those who love His name dwell therein.” Behold the sheepcote is built and the flock is brought into it, but I am not mentioned. Therefore it says: “Of David, to make mention. O God, to save me.”

<b>Concerning Solomon</b> He prayed this prayer on behalf of his son Solomon, for he foresaw with the holy spirit that he [Solomon] was destined to request of the Holy One, blessed be He, “a heart to understand, to hear judgment.”
<b>Your judgments</b> the wisdom of Your laws, which You commanded in the Torah.
<b>and Your righteousness</b> to judge justly.
<b>to a king, etc., to a king’s son</b> Both refer to Solomon. Another explanation:
<b>Give Your judgments to a king</b> The chastisements should end with me, and the charity You should bestow upon my son; viz. that there be peace in his days.
@3
<b>May the mountains bear</b> peace for the people in his days. Now what is the peace that the mountains bear? When they produce fruit, people will not be jealous, and “each man will call his neighbor [to come] under [his] vine and under [his] fig tree.”

@6
<b>May it descend as rain upon cut vegetation</b> May his word descend into the midst of Your people and into their heart as the rain that falls on the cut vegetation, which requires rain after being cut. As the matter is stated (Amos 7:1): “and behold the latter growth after the king’s mowings.”
<b>that drip upon the earth</b> Heb. זרזיף, an expression of drops. In Aramaic, in Tractate Yoma (87a): “Drops (זרזיפי) of water hit him.”
@7
<b>May the righteous flourish in his days</b> Israel.
<b>and much peace</b> will flourish in his days, and this peace will last forever. Now all this prayer was fulfilled except this thing, because Solomon sinned. Therefore his kingdom did not endure, for the kingship was given to David on this condition (I Kings 2: 4): “If your children take heed to their way,” but Israel sinned in his days. As it is said (ibid. 4: 20): “Judah and Israel [were] many, as the sand, etc.” And Israel flourished in his days, as it is said... And there was much peace, as it is said (ibid. 5:5): “And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, etc., all the days of Solomon.”

<b>And may he reign from sea to sea</b> All of the land of Israel is from the Sea of Reeds to the Sea of the Philistines [the Mediterranean].

<b>From blows and from robbery</b> Heb. מתוך ומחמס, from blows and from robbery. I found [the following]: מִתּוֹךְ is an expression of “his innermost midst (תּוֹךְ),” men of plots, who plot iniquity, as (Prov. 29:13): “a man of deep thoughts (תככים).”
<b>he will redeem their soul</b> through the justice and righteousness that he will perform for them.
@15
<b>And may he live</b> Solomon.

<b>of the gold of Sheba</b> And so it was (I Kings 3:13): “both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like you.”
<b>and may He pray for him constantly, etc.</b> The prayer and the blessing are identical. When the Holy One, blessed be He, says to a man, “You shall be blessed,” it is an expression of prayer.
@16
<b>May there be an abundance of grain</b> Heb. פסת, an expression of spreading (פסיון), increase and abundance. Our Sages, however, explained this as an expression of loaves of white bread during the messianic era (Keth. 111b, Shab. 30b), and the entire psalm as referring to the messianic era. Another explanation: פִּסַת is an expression of good will, like פִּיוּס, placating; the people are appeased and accepted by the Holy One, blessed be He, when He gives plenty in the world.
<b>may its fruit rustle like Lebanon</b> May the wheat kernels be as thick as the kidneys of a large ox, as happened in the days of Shimon ben Shatach.

<b>May his name</b> [May] Solomon’s name be remembered forever for his riches and his wisdom.
<b>before the sun, his name will be magnified</b> All the days of the sun, his name will be magnified.
<b>will be magnified</b> Heb. ינון, an expression of kingdom and dominion, as (Prov. 29:21): “he will ultimately be a ruler (מנון) ; (Gen. 21:23), “and to my son (ולניני),” who rules over my property after me; (below 74:8), “They said in their heart, their rulers (נינם) together”; their kings together.

@18
<b>Blessed is the Lord, etc., Who performs wonders alone</b> When the fire descended from the heavens through Solomon, his son.
@20
<b>The prayers of David...are completed</b> Heb. כלו. Our sages expounded on כָּלוּ to mean כָּל אֵלוּ, all these are the prayers of David son of Jesse, to include the entire Book on David’s nameeven what the sons of Korah and the ten elders said because he was known as (II Sam. 23:1) “the sweet singer of Israel.” כָּלוּ may also be interpreted as “were completed.” The construction of כָּלוּ is like (Job 24: 24): “They are taken away (רֹמוּ) in a second”; (Jer. 2:12), “O heavens, be astonished (שֹׁמוּ).” If this is so, this psalm was not written in its place, and there is no chronological order in the Book. The [subject] matter indicates that he said this in his old age, when he enthroned Solomon.

<b>A song of Asaph. Truly God is good to Israel, etc.</b> Since the topic of this psalm deals with the troubles that befall Israel, he commences it in this manner. And this is the meaning: Although I cry out and am dismayed at Israel’s troubles, I knew that the Holy One, blessed be He, is good to them, and that He brings evil upon them for their own good, in order to give them merit in the life of the world to come.

@4
<b>For there are no fetters to their death</b> Heb. חרצבות, an expression of tying, as (Isa. 58:6): “to undo the fetters (חרצבות) of wickedness,” meaning the locks of the fetters with which they bind the poor. Here, too, there are no pains to their death. Those who die among them die healthy, [strong as] a palace, without pains. But our Rabbis explained חַרְצֻבּוֹת as an abbreviation, meaning that they are not (שאין) frightened (חרדין) or saddened (עצבין) by the day of death (Shab. 31b). Another explanation: that the Holy One, blessed be He, does not delay (מאחר) their desire (צביונם).

<b>Therefore, they wear pride as a necklace</b> Because of this, pride adorns them as a necklace, insofar as it ascends upon his neck.

@7
<b>Because of their fat, their eyes bulge</b> Their eyes bulge because of the abundant fat, for in an emaciated person, the eyes are sunken.

@8

[Pharaoh said] (Exod. 5:2): “Who is the Lord that I should obey Him?” [Sennacherib said] (Isa. 36:20), “Who are they among all the gods of the lands...?” [Nebuchadnezzar said] (Isa. 14:14), “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.” That is the meaning of: “They have set their mouth against Heaven.”
@10
<b>Therefore, His people will return here</b> Since His people sees that the way of the wicked prospers, they will return on the way of the wicked, to adopt their ways.

@12
<b>Behold these are wicked</b> They [are wicked] and transgress His Torah; yet they are tranquil in the world and increase power and wealth.
<b>they are tranquil in the world</b> An expression of tranquility.
<b>have increased</b> Heb. השגו, have increased. Menachem (p. 72) explains: יָשוּב עַמוֹ הֲלוֹם, the wicked will return to crush (להלם) the people of the Holy One, blessed be He. The first interpretation I learned from the words of Rabbi Meir the son of Isaac, the cantor, may the memory of the righteous be for a blessing.
@13

@17
<b>Until</b> I came to the sanctuaries of God, which are in Jerusalem, and saw what happened to Sennacherib. Then I understood the end of the wicked, that it is to destruction. Then I said, “All the good that comes to them is only slippery places; for the Holy One, blessed be He, makes their way slippery, that it should be easy and smooth, so that they should not put their heart to return to Him, and they should perish.”
@18
<b>Only in slippery places do You set them</b> All the goodness that comes to them, for ultimately, You cast them down to ruin.

@21
<b>For my heart was in ferment</b> Before I saw this downfall with the holy spirit, my heart was in ferment because the way of the wicked prospered, and my mind was on edge (אשתונן), an expression of a sharpened sword (שנון). When it is reflexive, the “tav” is placed in the middle of the radical, as is the case of every word whose radical commences with “shin.”

@24
<b>You led me</b> Heb. תנחני, [like] נחיתני, You led me.
<b>and after[wards], You took me [for] glory</b> If the cantillation sign were on כָּבוֹד, its interpretation would be: After You bestowed upon Sennacherib all the glory You had allotted to him, You will take me to You. You have performed wondrous miracles for Israel and have destroyed Sennacherib. Now that the cantillation sign is on ואחר, this is its interpretation: (and afterwards,) You took me to glory; You drew me to You for glory and beauty.

@3
<b>Raise Your blows to inflict eternal ruin</b> Raise Your blows and Your terrors that Your enemies will experience as eternal ruin for every evil thing that the enemy did in the Temple. In this manner, Menachem (p. 144) associates it with (Gen. 41:8): “that his spirit was troubled (ותפעם).”

<b>Your meeting place</b> That is the Temple about which it is said (Exod. 25:22): וְנוֹעַדְתִּי לְךָ שָׁם, “There I will meet with you at appointed times.”

@5
<b>May he be known as though bringing on high; the hatchets were in the thicket of the trees</b> The enemy knows that when he strikes the gates of the entrances of the Sanctuary, it was as though he was bringing his blows on high, even into the sky. Now how did he know it? For he would see that the trees would entangle, grasp, and swallow up the hatchets, as our Rabbis said (Sanh. 96b): One gate of Jerusalem swallowed them all up.
<b>the hatchets were in the thicket of the trees</b> Heb. בסבך-עץ, an expression of (Gen. 22:13): “caught in the thicket (בסבך).” The tree entangles them, and they become entangled in it.
@6
<b>And now</b> although he saw that this troubled the Holy One, blessed be He, he did not refrain from striking all its entrances and all its gates together.
<b>with hatchets and hammers</b> They are tools of destruction used by carpenters (Jer. 46:22): “and will come against her with axes (ובקרדמות).” Jonathan renders: בּכשיליא. כֵּילַפּוֹת is Arabic. This is how Dunash (p. 34) explained it, and it is one of the carpenters’ tools.

The Philistines destroyed Shiloh; Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the First Temple; Titus destroyed the Second Temple.

<b>There He broke the arrows of the bow</b> of Sennacherib and his hosts.
<b>the arrows of the bow</b> Heb. רשפי. רִשְׁפֵי is not an expression of sparks of fire, because sparks of fire are not appropriate to a bow. Moreover, this word has no “dagesh,” yet רִשְׁפֵּי does have a “dagesh.” Rather, רִשְׁפֵי is an expression of (Deut. 32:24): “fought by demons (רשף),” which is translated as עוֹף, flying creatures, as (Job 5:7): “but flying creatures fly (רשף) upward.” Similarly (below 78:48): “and their cattle to the flying creatures (לרשפים). to the birds. Similarly, בְּנֵי רֶשֶׁף are flying creatures, demons, who fly upward. This one too is an expression of arrows, which fly, as the matter that is stated (below 91:5): “from an arrow that flies by day.” There He broke the arrows (רִשְׁפֵי) of the bow, the arrows that the bow lets fly, and this entire psalm speaks of the downfall of Sennacherib, for we find no enemy falling in Jerusalem but he.

<b>You are destructive; mightier</b> Heb. נאור, an expression of (Lam. 2:7): “He destroyed His Sanctuary”; (below 89:40), “You abolished the covenant of Your servant.” You destroy Your enemies and those who rise up against You and sweep them from the world. Because of His deeds, He is called נאור, destructive, like חנוּן, gracious; רחום, merciful; קנוא jealous, because He grants, because He pities, because He acts with zeal.

[The word] אשתוללוּ is derived from (Job 12:17): “He leads counselors away with madness (שולל).” It is an expression of error and tranquility, as madmen err, and the “tav” falls into the middle of the word in the reflexive, as in every word beginning with “shin.”

<b>it will prevent the residue of wrath</b> Heb. תחגר. It will prevent and stop; the remaining wicked men are prevented and restrained from showing their pride and their wrath. תחגר is an expression of restraint in the language of the Mishnah (Chul. 18a): “The nick in a knife must be deep enough to catch (תחגר) the nail to disqualify it from slaughtering].” I heard in the name of Rabbi Eleazar the Gaon, the son of Rabbi Isaac, who brought this verse as testimony to that Mishnah (sic). It is also possible to interpret this according to its usual meaning of an expression of girding, and can be explained as follows: It is fitting for You to gird Yourself with wrath and to enwrap Yourself with zeal, for strength and ability are Yours; the expression of “residue” is that since man’s wrath is of no account, the girding of all wrath is reserved for You.

<b>You held fast the awakenings of my eyes</b> Heb. שמרות, an expression of the watch (אשמרת) of the night, for [when] a person awakens from his sleep his mind is settled and his heart returns to him, but I am not like that. In this night of exile, my eyes are always stuck together, like a man sleeping from a clogged heart, and in the troubles that I see, my spirit throbs and I have no speech within me.

@25

@38
<b>But He is merciful</b> to them and constantly expiates their iniquity, and He did not destroy them.
<b>many times</b> Many times He withdraws His wrath from them, and even if He punishes them, He does not arouse all His anger but little by little, because He remembers that they are flesh and that the evil inclination is hidden in their heart. That is a spirit that goes away when they die, and that spirit does not return to them in the world to come. When they are resurrected, the evil inclination will have no control over them. “A spirit that goes away and does not return” cannot be explained to mean their spirit of life, because if you say so, you have denied the resurrection of the dead. In this manner, it is explained in Aggadath Tehillim (Mid Ps. 78:8).

@48
<b>He gave over their animals to hail</b> When the hail began to fall, the Egyptian drove his sheep (his animal) into the house, and the hail came before him like a wall. The Egyptian slaughtered it [the animal] and put it on his shoulder, to take it to his house to eat it, but the birds came and took it from him. That is [the meaning of] “and their cattle to the birds (לרשפים),” as (Job. 5:7): “but flying creatures (בני רשף) fly upward.” This is its midrashic interpretation (Mid. Ps. 78:14), but according to its simple meaning, רשפים are bolts of fire, as it is written (Exod. 9:24): “and fire flaming within the hail.”
@50
<b>He leveled a path for His anger</b> Although the plagues were dispatched in anger, they performed only their orders; what they were commanded to kill, they killed, but nothing else. They went in their paths. In other commentaries I found as follows:
<b>He leveled a path for His anger</b> When He smote every firstborn in Egypt, He showed the way for [the angel] who was destroying with anger to enter the houses of the Egyptians, but not the houses of the children of Israel.
<b>...and...their body</b> Heb. וחיתם, their body.

@63
<b>Fire consumed his youths</b> [The fire of] His wrath.
<b>were not married</b> Heb. לא הוללו. They were not married by being brought into a litter [under] a canopy because the youths died in battle. הוּלָלוּ is an expression of nuptials (הִלוּלָא) in Aramaic. Our Sages, however, explained it in reference to Nadab and Abihu (Mid. Ps. 78:18), but I feel uncertain about explaining it that way because he already commenced with the Tabernacle of Shiloh.
@64
<b>His priests fell by the sword</b> Hophni and Phinehas.
<b>but his widows did not weep</b> Even his widow was not allowed to bewail him, for she too died on the day of the tidings, as it is said (I Sam. 4: 19): “And she knelt and gave birth, for her pains had suddenly come upon her.”

Mechilta, Shirah 10, Keth. 5a, Rashi to Exod. 15:17.) Another explanation:
<b>And He built His Sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth He established it</b> Just as heaven and earth have no substitute, neither does the Temple have a substitute in which to let the Shechinah rest.
@70
<b>and took him from the sheepcotes</b> Heb. ממכלאתצאן, from the stalls of the sheep, as (Hab. 3: 16): “The flock will be cut off from the fold (ממכלה).”
@71
<b>From behind the nursing ewes He brought him</b> For he would shepherd the nursing ewes for his father, because he was merciful and would bring the kids first and feed them the upper tips of the grasses, which are tender. Then after them he would bring out the he-goats, who would eat the middle of the grasses, and afterwards, he would bring out the older ones, who would eat the roots. Said the Holy One, blessed be He, “This one is fit to shepherd My people.”

<b>into heaps</b> Now what is this song? Is it not a lamentation? But because it says (Lam. 4:11): “The Lord has spent His fury.” With what has He spent it? “He has kindled a fire in Zion.” This is a song and an occasion for singing, for He poured out His fury on the wood and stones and did not utterly destroy His children.
@2
<b>the flesh of Your pious ones</b> Now were they not wicked? But since they received their punishment, they are accounted as pious men. Similarly, Scripture states (Deut. 25:3): “your brother would be degraded before your eyes.” As soon as he is lashed, he is your brother. It is explained in this manner in the Aggadah (Mid. Ps. 79:4).
@4

<b>the children of the mother who died</b> The children of her who was killed because of You; enmorinede in Old French, doomed to die. There is an example in the Sages’ language: “It is better that Jews eat the flesh of slaughtered dying beasts rather than eat the flesh of the carcasses of dying animals.” That means the flesh of a dying animal that was slaughtered, in tractate Kiddushin (21b).

It is fitting for You and it is incumbent upon You to save, whether guilty or innocent, as it was said to Moses in Egypt (Exod. 3:7): “I have seen the affliction of My people.” Why is the word for seeing repeated? I see that they are destined to provoke Me. Nevertheless, I have seen their affliction, because of the oath that I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
<b>Ephraim</b> in the war with Aram, when he besieged Samaria and sent emissaries to Ahab (I Kings 20:3): “Your silver and gold are mine; your beautiful wives and children are mine.”
<b>Manasseh</b> in the days of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, as it is said (II Kings 13:4, 7): “for He saw Israel’s oppression, etc., for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like dust to trample.” And he beat him in war three times, as it is said (II Kings 13: 25): “Joash overcame him three times and recovered the cities of Israel.”
<b>Benjamin</b> in the time of Ahasuerus, when Mordechai and Esther were in danger, and all Israel depended on them.
<b>and it is for You to save us</b> Heb. ולכה. This is not an expression of going, but is like לְךָ, and so it is in the Masorah of (Gen. 27:37): “and for you (ולכה) then,” of Jacob; (II Sam. 18:22) “since for you (ולכה) there is no [reward] given for news”; (Isa. 3:6), “You have (לכה) a garment; be an officer to us, etc.”

@6
<b>You have fed them bread of tears</b> in Egypt.
<b>and You have given them to drink tears in large measure</b> Heb. שליש. In Babylon, where they were for seventy years, a third (שליש) of the two hundred and ten of Egypt. I learned this from the work of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan. It may also be interpreted as regards the kingdom of Greece, which represents the third trouble. If you ask, is that [not] the fourth, because Persia and Media came before, all the seventy years of the Babylonian exile are only one exile. Menachem (p. 175) interprets שליש as the name of a drinking vessel. So he explained (Isa. 40:12): “and He measured with a ‘shalish’ the dust of the earth.” Our Sages explained it (Mid. Ps. 80: 4) as referring to the three tears that Esau shed, concerning whom it is said (Gen. 27:34): “and he cried a cry.” That is one. “A great one.” That is two. “And a bitter one.” That is three. Because of them, he merited to live by his sword, as it is said (Gen. 27:40): “and it will come to pass when you complain, etc.”

@14
<b>The boar from the forest gnaws at it</b> Heb. יכרסמנה, as (Peah 2:7): “A field that the ants have nibbled (קרסמוה),” an expression of plucking out.
<b>from the forest</b> Heb. מיער. The “ayin” is suspended (as though it were written with an “aleph”). If Israel is worthy, the enemies are like the beasts of the river, which have no strength to climb out upon the dry land; but when retribution is decreed upon them, he (sic) grows strong as the beast of the forest, which destroys and kills. The boar of the forest is Esau, as is written (Dan. 7:7): “It devoured and broke in pieces and the rest it trampled with its feet.” And it (the swine) has some signs of purity. Esau, too, has the merit of his fathers.
<b>and the creeping things of the field</b> Heb. זיז, all creeping things of the field. The expression זיז means anything that constantly moves from its place.
<b>graze upon it</b> Graze upon it and its branches and eat them.

Behold Philistia and Tyre with Cush, because they are near Rahab and Babylon, all the nations exalt them [the Israelites] and say about them, ‘This one was born there,’ in Egypt or Babylon.”

This is what Isaiah says (66:21): “And from them, too, will I take for priests and for Levites.” From the nations bringing them for tribute, I shall take those assimilated among them. And there will be among them priests and Levites who are unrecognizable, but they are revealed to Me, says the Lord. Now where did He say it?

Therefore, Adam died within a thousand [years] for had he lived a thousand [years] it would be more than the day of the Holy One, blessed be He. Perhaps the amount of that watch equals the time from the death of Adam until a thousand years, but we do not know how much that watch was, except from conjecture. I found [this]:
<b>For a thousand years are in Your eyes, etc.</b> And when repentance came into Your thoughts from the beginning, You judged well and created it. Now those years were appropriate for it because people’s days were many, so that a thousand years were in Your eyes like one passing day, which passed and was gone, with a little of the night with it, for You said to Adam (Gen. 2:17): “for on the day you eat of it, you will surely die,” and he lived nine hundred and thirty years.

As the matter that is said (below 126:1) “When the Lord returns the returnees to Zion, we shall be like dreamers.” This was stated regarding the Babylonian exile, which lasted seventy years.

The word נביא is an expression of bringing [rather than of a prophet. Cf. B.B. 12a, Targum ad. loc, Redak below]. (Some say: According to the number of our days כן, according to the numerical value of כן, seventy years.

<b>and [people] should ask and search from their ruins</b> Everyone will ask about them, what happened to So-and-so and So-and-so, because of the rumor of ruin that emerged about them. And “search” (וְדָרְשוּ) means from others, because it is vowelized with a short “kamatz,” and וְשִׁאֵלוּ also means from others, that others should ask about them. This can also be interpreted as וְשִׁאֵלוּ, of the intensive conjugation, meaning that they will go around by the doors [to beg for alms].

<b>you are a priest forever because of the speech of Malchizedek</b> From you will emerge the priesthood and the kingship that your children will inherit from Shem your progenitor, the priesthood and the kingship, which were given to him. דִבְרָתִי מלכי-צדק. The “yud” is superfluous, like (Lam. 1:1): “the city that was once so populous (רבתי).” Because of the speech of Malchizedek, because of the command of Malchizedek. You are a priest, Heb. כהן. The word כהן bears the connotation of priesthood and rulership, as (II Sam. 8:18): “and David’s sons were chief officers.”

<b>a heap of corpses</b> Heb. מלא, a heap of corpses. מלא is an expression of gathering, as (Jer. 12:6): “have called a gang (מלא) after you”; (Isa. 31:4), “although a band (מלא) of shepherds gather against him.” Now where did He execute justice, making them a heap of corpses? (Exod. 14:30), “the Egyptians dead on the seashore.”
<b>He crushed the head on a great land</b> This resembles the prophecy of Habakkuk (3:12): “You have crushed the head of the house of the wicked.” [This refers to] the head of Pharaoh, who was the head and the prince of a land greater and more esteemed than all the lands, as is said (above 102:20): “a ruler of peoples [sent] and loosed his bonds,” for all the nations were under the rule of Egypt.

<b>From the stream on the way he would drink, etc.</b> From the Nile River, on the way of its course, his land would drink, and it was not in need of rain water. Therefore, he would raise his head and boast (Ezek. 29:3): “My river is my own, and I made myself.” In another manner, this psalm can be explained regarding David: [1]

<b>Your people will volunteer on the day of your host</b> The people of Israel will volunteer to your aid on the day that you form an army, as it is delineated in (I) Chronicles (12:21); that they were joining him from every tribe: “When he went to Ziklag, there deserted to him of Manasseh, etc.”; (ibid. verse 8): “And from the Gadites there separated themselves to David, etc.”

<b>You are a priest forever</b> And which of the priesthoods? A priesthood that is above the priesthood of Malchizedek, and that is the kingdom, which is above the high priesthood in thirty steps.
<b>above the charge of Malchizedek</b> above the priesthood (Some mss. read: above the charge) of Malchizedek, who was a priest to the Most High God. Now if you challenge that he too was a king, [we answer that] the kingdom over the nations was not an esteemed kingdom when compared to Israel. [5]

<b>Hallelujah, I shall thank, etc.</b> This psalm was based on the alphabet, one letter at the beginning of the verse and one in the middle of it, and so all of them [this psalm’s verses are] from “aleph” to “tav,” and so too is the second psalm. The first one speaks in praises of the Holy One, blessed be He, and the second one speaks in praise of a righteous, God-fearing person.
@4
<b>He made a memorial</b> He set down for Israel Sabbaths and festivals and commandments, of which was stated (Deut. 5:15): “And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt,” because He is gracious and merciful to His children, and He wishes to make them righteous.
@5
<b>He gave food</b> Heb. טֶרֶף, food.
@6
<b>The strength of His works He related to His people</b> When He gave them the inheritance of the nations, He let them know His strength and His might. And Midrash Tanchuma (Buber, Bereishith 11): He wrote for Israel [about] the Creation to let them know that the earth is His and that it is in His power to settle in it anyone He wishes, and to move these out and settle others, so that the nations will not be able to say to Israel, “You are thieves, for you conquered the land of the seven nations.”

<b>He shone a light in the darkness</b> Heb. זרח [the “kal” conjugation], like הזריח, [the “hiph’il” or causative conjugation]. Its midrashic interpretation is that He Himself, so to speak, becomes a light for them, as (above 27:1): “The Lord is my light and my salvation.”
@5
<b>Good is the man who is gracious, etc.</b> who is gracious to the poor and lends [to] them, and is not strict, saying, “I cannot afford it,” but [instead] his things, which he needs for himself, in food, drink, and clothing, he conducts with moderation and with a measure, and he spares his property.

<b>A wicked man will see and become angry</b> Heb. וכעס, an expression of a verb in the past tense, equivalent to ויכעס [i.e., the “vav” converts the past tense to the future]. Therefore, it is vowelized half with a “kamatz” and half with a “pattah,” and the accent is at the end of the word.

<b>a people of a strange tongue</b> With another language, which is not the Holy Tongue. A similar expression is (Isa. 33:19): “A people of a strange tongue you shall not see, a people of speech too obscure, etc.” The “nun” and the “lammed” are interchangeable, like נִשְׁכָּה, chamber, which is [equivalent to] לִשְׁכָּה, in the Book of Ezra (Neh. 13:7).
@2
<b>Judah became His holy nation</b> He took Judah as the lot of His portion and His sanctity, and even they sanctified His name when they descended into the sea, as the matter that is stated (above 68: 28): “the princes of Judah pelt them with stones.” Similarly, this verse is explained in the Aggadah (Mid. Ps. 114:8): Judah became His holy people, for Nahshon sprang into the sea and said, “I shall descend first,” and that is what [the Psalmist] says: Judah became His holy people.
@3

@3
<b>bands of death</b> Heb. חבלי, bands of enemies who sought to kill me. [The expressions] חבלי מות, חבלי שאוֹל, are all an expression of bands, like (I Sam. 10:5): “a band of (חבל) prophets.”
@9

<b>I believed so that I spoke</b> I believed the words of Ziba which he spoke about Mephibosheth, so that I should say (II Sam. 16:4), “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” Then I humbled myself exceedingly. I had spoken harshly, and I submitted myself to you [Mephibosheth].
@11
<b>I said in my haste</b> to flee from before Absalom.
<b>“All men are liars”</b> Heb. כזב, [meaning that one] betrays his friend, for I saw my son betray me and seek my life, and [I saw] all Israel repay me with evil for good; therefore, I believed Ziba and said that Mephibosheth also lies and betrays me. Every expression of כָּזָב is purely an expression of lack of trust that they trusted in him; falenze in Old French, betrayal, deceit, like (Isa. 58:11): “whose water does not fail (יכזבו).” Others interpret it:
<b>I said in my haste</b> at the Rock of the Divisions, when Saul and his men were encircling me and my men, to seize me, and there it says (I Sam. 23:26): “and David was hastening to get away.”
<b>“All men are liars”</b> Even the prophet Samuel, who is faithful as a prophet, even he is a deceiver, for he anointed me king.

@8
<b>It is better to take shelter in the Lord</b> Heb. לחסות. This shelter (חסיון) is only an expression of the shelter of a shadow, a small thing. Trust (מבטח) is a stout and strong support. Nevertheless, to take shelter in the Lord is better than the promises of human beings.
@10
<b>All nations surrounded me</b> This speaks about the war of Gog and Magog, when all the nations will be there, as it is said (Zech. 14:2): “And I shall gather all the nations to Jerusalem to wage war.”

@12
<b>they were extinguished like a thorn fire</b> Every expression of דעיכה coincides with an expression of springing and skipping. It hastens to spring and skip from its place. Therefore, it fits with an expression of fire or with an expression of water, like (Job 6:17): “they jump (נדעכו) from their place.” Similarly (Job 17:1), “my days flicker (נדעכו)”; similarly (Job 18:6), “and his candle that is over him shall go out (ידעך),” in the way that the flame springs from the wick and ascends upward when it is extinguished.
@13
<b>You pushed me to fall</b> You, my enemy.
@14
<b>The might and the cutting power of God was my salvation</b> Heb. עזי וזמרת, the might of the Holy One, blessed be He, was my salvation. עזי has a superfluous “yud” because we do not [usually] find עזי vowelized with a short “kamatz” instead of a “shuruk,” except in three places, where it is next to וזמרת, and perforce is attached to the word denoting the name of God. You cannot explain it as “my praise.” Do not wonder about ויהי לי, that he did not say היה לי לישועה, for there are many like these in Scripture, [e.g.] (Exod. 9:21): “And whoever did not pay attention...left (ויעזב) his slaves, etc.” He should have written עַזָב.

<b>A voice of singing praises and salvation</b> will in the future be in the tents of the righteous, and what is that voice of singing praises? “The right hand of the Lord deals valiantly.” They will sing, “The right hand of the Lord is exalted, etc.”
@16
<b>The right hand of the Lord is exalted</b> The Midrash Aggadah states: The Holy One, blessed be He, created the celestial beings with His right hand; therefore, death has no power over them; as it says (Isa. 48:13): “Even my hand laid the foundation of the earth.” This is the left hand. “And My right hand measured the heavens with handbreadths.” This is the right hand. Similarly, the Psalmist says: “The right hand of the Lord is exalted,” that created those [that are] in the heights of the world. That is the right hand of the Lord that will make armies of righteous men in the future, and also with it [the right hand] He will resurrect them and they will live forever. And then, I shall not die, but I shall live forever.

<b>Bind the sacrifice with ropes</b> The sacrifices and the festival offerings, which were clean and examined for a blemish, they would bind to the feet of their beds until they brought them to the Temple court at the corners of the altar. It is also possible to interpret the entire end of this psalm from (verse 17), “I shall not die but I shall live,” as referring to David himself: [18]
<b>God has chastised me</b> For the episode of Bath sheba with torments, e.g. (II Sam. 12:6): “And the ewe-lamb he shall repay fourfold.” David was stricken with zaraath for six months.
<b>but He has not delivered me to death</b> (II Sam. 13) “Also the Lord has removed your sin; you shall not die.” [19]
<b>Open for me the gates of righteousness</b> And these are the gates of righteousnessthose gates of synagogues and study halls, which are the Lord’sand the righteous enter through them. [21]
<b>I shall thank You because You have answered me</b> From here on, David, Samuel, Jesse, and David’s brothers recited this, as is delineated in [the chapter entitled] “The eves of Passovers,” (Pes. 119a). He who said this did not say the other.

<b>My prayers</b> These prayers of mine are that my ways should be established Likewise (II Kings 5:3): “The supplications (אחלי) for my master should be that he go before the prophet who is in Samaria, etc.” The supplications of those who pray should be that he go before the prophet who is in Samaria, and it is an expression of wishes, souhait in French, as a person says, “If only I were a prophet and a sage.”

@59

@61
<b>Bands of wicked men robbed me</b> Heb. עודני. Bands of wicked men plundered me, like (Gen. 49: 27): “in the morning he will eat plunder (עד).” In this manner, Menachem (p. 131) associated it. It may also be interpreted as an expression of עוֹד, more, i.e., increased and outnumbered me.

<b>I recited</b> Heb. אענה, an expression of studying and reciting in the study hall, like (verse 172): “My tongue will utter (תען) Your word.” Similarly (Mal. 2:12): “From the man who commits it, the Lord shall cut off one of acuity or erudition (ועונה) from the tents of Jacob.” An ingenious one among the sages, and one who can answer among the students.

And a poor man is accounted as dead. Therefore, revive me according to Your words.

@117
<b>and I shall constantly engage in Your statutes</b> Heb. ואשעה, and I shall engage, like (Exod. 5: 9): “and let them not engage (ישעו) in useless things.” Another explanation: [It is] an expression of telling and reciting, as we translate (Deut. 28:37): “and a recitation (ולשועין).”

@125

@126
<b>A time to do for the Lord, etc.</b> This goes back to the verse preceding it: Enable me to understand, and I shall know Your testimonies, to know a time to do for Your name. What should they do, those who made Your Torah void, to find good will and forgiveness, and that You should be found by them, and I will do so for every transgression that I have committed. Our Rabbis, however, derived from it [from this verse] that we may transgress the words of the Torah in order to make a fence and a wall [a safeguard] for Israel, e.g. Gideon and Elijah on Mount Carmel, who sacrificed on high places (Ber. 63a). I saw [it] further expounded upon in the Aggadah (Yerushalmi Ber. 9:4, Mid. Sam 1:1) as meaning: A person who is idle and leisurely, who devotes [only occasional] times to his Torah, makes void the covenant, for an idle person must toil in the Torah all hours of the day.
@127
<b>Because I loved</b> Heb. על-כן. Because I loved Your commandments, it is fitting that You teach me a time of good will, and what I should do for You that You should accept me. There are many [instances of] על-כן that are to be interpreted as “because”; e.g., (Gen. 33:10): “because (כי על-כן) I have seen your face”; (Num. 10:33). “because (כי על-כן) you know our encampment”; (Isa. 15: 7), “Because of (כי על-כן) the many things they did.”
@128
<b>Because I considered all precepts of all things upright</b> All precepts, everything that You commanded in your Torah.
<b>I considered upright</b> Heb. ישרתי. They were upright in my eyes, and I said about them that they are upright. Because of this, I deserve that You forgive me and favor me.
@129
<b>Your testimonies are hidden</b> They are covered, and your testimonies are hidden from the sons of men. There are easy commandments for which He gave a large reward, such as sending away the nest.

@130
<b>The commencement of Your words enlightens</b> The beginning of your words enlightened the heart of Israel, that You understated the simple, by Your statement (Exod. 20:2): “I am...Who took you out.” You let them know the favor that You did for them—that You acquired them from the house of bondageto know that You are their Master, and they should accept Your kingdom upon themselves. (Exod. 20:3): “You shall not have another god, etc.” and afterwards You made Your decrees (Cf. Mechilta ad loc.). Another explanation:
<b>The commencement of Your words enlightens</b> The beginning of Your words in the Creation was (Gen. 1:3): “Let there be light.”
<b>You make the simple understand</b> From there, everyone will understand and will commence with words of Torah. Tanchuma (Vayakhel 6).
@131

<b>Redeem me from the oppression of man</b> Redeem me so that no man oppress me.
@139
<b>My zeal incenses me</b> Heb. קנאתי. The zeal with which I am zealous for Your name against those who forget Your words, cuts me and incenses me against them.
@141
<b>I am young and despised</b> As it is stated (I Sam. 17:14): “And David was the youngest.” I am despised to the extent that I humble myself beside those who engage in the Torah, to learn, for I have not forgotten Your precepts; [nor have I refrained] from searching and debating with them about Your righteousness that is within them [the precepts], which is righteousness and truth to eternity; and even though troubles have befallen me, they were my occupation. And forever enable me to understand their righteousness and I shall live by them (Deut. 30:20): “for it [the Torah] is your life and the length of your days.”

<b>From before, I knew from Your testimonies</b> Before the thing came about, I knew it from Your testimonies. Before they inherited the land, You commanded them about the first fruits, heave offerings, and tithes, and before You gave them rest from their enemies, You commanded them (Deut. 25:19): “And it will be, when the Lord Your God gives you rest, etc.” to appoint a king, to annihilate Amalek, and to build the Temple.
<b>to the world</b> For You established Your testimonies concerning all things destined to be until the end of the world.
@160
<b>The beginning of Your word is true</b> And the end of Your word is not true? Rather, the end of Your word proves that the beginning of Your word is true. For, when the nations heard, “I am the Lord your God,” and “You shall not have [another god],” and “You shall not take, etc.,” they said, “Everything is for His benefit and for His glory.” As soon as they heard, “Honor, etc.; You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery,” they admitted [that they had erred] about the beginning of Your word, that it is true.
@162
<b>I rejoice over Your word</b> Over Your promise that You promised me. Another explanation: Over one of Your enigmatic statements, when I understand it. Our Rabbis, however, interpreted it as referring to circumcision, for [when] David was in the bathhouse and saw himself without zizith, without tefillin, and without Torah, he said, “Woe is to me, for I am naked of all commandments.” As soon as he thought of the circumcision, he rejoiced and said when he emerged (from the bathhouse), “I rejoice over Your word.” [This refers to] circumcision, which was first given with a saying (אמירה), and not with speaking (דיבור), as it is said (Gen. 17:9): “And God said (ויאמר) to Abraham, ‘And you shall keep My covenant.’”

And our Rabbis said that David composed them to raise the deep, as is explained in Tractate Succah (53a).

<b>(A song for ascents</b> The simple meaning is that when the Levites began to ascend the steps, they recited this song. Although this song is not written first, there is no chronological sequence.) (In other books I found:)
<b>A song for ascents</b> [The Psalmist] alludes, in the second psalm, to the steps that ascend for the righteous in the future from beneath the tree of life to the Throne of Glory, as we learned in Sifrei (Ekev 47): “It does not say here, ‘A song of ascents’ but, ‘A song for ascents’; a song for the One Who is destined to make ascents for the righteous in the future.” This is what the Kalir established (in the concluding poem of the morning service for the second day of Succoth, which was composed by Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Simon the son of Yochai in Chagigah, chapter “We may not expound,” see there): “And from beneath them thirty steps, one above the other until the Throne of Glory, flying and ascending with the pleasant speech of the song of ascents.”

If the Egyptians ruled over their own bodies, surely [they ruled] over their wives. Said the Holy One, blessed be He, “I attest that they are the sons of their fathers.” He bestowed His name upon them: the Reubenites (הראובני), the Simeonites (השמעוני) (Num. 26). He added the letters of the name, one on this side and one on that side. The result is that this name יָ-הּ is testimony to Israel.

In all the boundaries he says, “And the border went up...and the border circled,” but here he says, “And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnon... Jerusalem.” Jerusalem is [therefore] found to be higher than all the lands, and it is fit for the Temple, as it is said (Deut. 17:8): “and you shall arise and ascend to the place, etc.” This teaches [us] that the Temple is higher than the whole land of Israel. So it is expounded upon in tractate Zevahim (54b).

But [there is], in words of Torah and post- Mosaic Scriptures, an allegory and a figure, and [in the] words of the wise and their riddles, but the primary meaning of the song of ascents is that it was said regarding the Temple.

Ps. 139:3) as referring to the droplet of [semen, transmitted in] sexual intercourse, from whose choicest part the fetus is formed, and the meaning of זֵרִיתָ (זורה) is an expression of winnowing the grain to purify it of the refuse it contains.

<b>Lest you weigh the path of life</b> So did the Sages (Tanhuma Ekev 2) expound it: The Holy One, blessed be He, moved away (טלטל) the reward for the commandments and did not explain it [the reward], so that a person should not see a commandment for which the reward is great and cling to it and leave over the other commandments. This is the interpretation: Lest you weigh the ways of the Torah, which one to take and which one to leave, therefore its paths wandered off—God caused them to wander off and He did not make them known. This is the Midrash Aggadah, but according to the sequence of the verses, since after it is written: “And now, children, hearken to me and do not turn away from the sayings of my mouth. Distance your way from her,” it appears that he has not yet ended the section dealing with the harlot, and it should be interpreted as follows:
<b>Lest you weigh the path of life</b> Do not weigh the path of life in conjunction with that strange one, saying what to do, whether this one or this one [i.e., whether to follow the path of life or the path of the strange woman], for the paths of the harlot have wandered off to the grave, and you will not know how to beware until you wander off and fall.

<b>Your fountain shall be blessed, and you shall rejoice with the wife of your youth</b> That is the Torah which you learned in your youth.

<b>you shall always be intoxicated</b> Heb. תשגה. I saw in the words of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan that תשגה means “you shall always busy yourself,” and it is an Arabic expression. He cited as proof, “to seek shegiah,” meaning to seek business, but I do not know where it is stated. But our Sages explained it as an expression of intoxication (lit. inadvertence), as its apparent meaning. On account of her love, you shall be inadvertent in your other affairs, because she will guard your things. They said concerning Rabbi Eleazar the son of Pedath, that he was preaching in the lower market and his cloak was lying in the upper market. Once a man came and found a snake coiled on it.

<b>and give your fellow superiority</b> Heb. ורהב. And if he has no money with you, only that you were trapped with the sayings of your mouth by speaking harshly to him, bring many friends to him to beg him to forgive you. Another explanation:
<b>[1] My son, if you stood surety for your Friend</b> After you stood surety for the Holy One, blessed be He, Who is your “friend,” as it is written (Song 5:16): “This is my beloved and this is my friend”; you undertook at Sinai and in the plains of Moab with a curse and with an oath to observe His commandments.
<b>have given your hand to a stranger</b> You have repented and turned from His ways and clung to the disbelievers to go in their ways.
<b>[2] you have been trapped by the sayings of your mouth</b> You have given your hand to cling to strangers.
<b>[3] Do this, then, my son, and be saved</b> Since you have come into the palm of your Friend at Sinai and you have accepted His Godliness over you,
<b>go, humble yourself</b> Heb. התרפס. Humble yourself before Him like a threshold, which is trodden (נרפסת) and stepped on.

@23
<b>For a commandment is a candle, and the Torah is light</b> Just as light always illuminates, so does the merit of the Torah stand for a person forever, but the merit of the commandment is only for a limited time, like the light of a candle. Another explanation:
<b>For a commandment is a candle, etc.</b> The command of the father is a candle. Whoever fulfills the command of his father is as though he takes a candle in his hand to light a dark place, and if he loses anything there he finds it by its light; similarly, whoever fulfills his mother’s instruction—it is light to him, and so [Scripture] states (verse 20): “and forsake not the instruction of your mother.” It is certain that this verse speaks of the commands of one’s father and mother, for it is written (20:20): “If one curses his father or mother, his candle will be put out in the blackest darkness.” Now if a person’s candle goes out when he does not fulfill the commandments of his parents, conversely when he fulfills the command, his candle lights up (Rabbi Joseph Kara).

@31
<b>And if he is found, he will pay sevenfold, etc.</b>
@32
<b>One who commits adultery with a woman</b> The three of them are combined in one statement. If a thief commits a theft, he should not be despised as much as the adulterer. Why? Because he steals in order to sate his hunger, and perhaps he has nothing to eat. And, when he is found, he can rectify his sin with payment; at the most, he will pay sevenfold i.e., many times the double payment and even fifty times for one. Some explain “sevenfold” as referring to one who steals an ox and his trappings and slaughters it, who pays five cattle and double payment of the trappings (totalling seven). [31]
<b>he must give all he owns</b> lit. he must give all the property of his house. And, even if he must sell all he owns because of this, he can nevertheless rectify it, and from the beginning he did it because of hunger. But...
<b>One who commits adultery with a woman is devoid of sense</b> since he does not do it because of hunger.
<b>one who would destroy his soul—he will do it</b> The lewd act.
@33
<b>He will find wounds and disgrace</b> Lesions are sent for idolatry and immorality.
@34
<b>for jealousy</b> For the jealousy of the Holy One, blessed be He, Who is the Mighty One over all, will be aroused to mete out retribution upon him, and He will not have pity on the day of vengeance.
@35
<b>He will not have regard</b> for any money to expiate for his denial of Him and his cleaving to idolatry. And our Rabbis expounded (Tosefta Baba Kamma 7:3): They will not despise a thief—This is one who steals away from his friend and goes to the study hall and engages in Torah. If he is found, he will pay sevenfold. [The intention is that] eventually, he will be appointed as a judge, and he will render legal decisions, for “sevenfold” refers only to the Torah, as it is said (Ps. 12:7): “refined sevenfold.”

@11
<b>The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked, etc.</b> Their mouth conceals the violence that is in their heart, for they talk smoothly with their lips, but hatred is hidden in their heart. Now the interpretation of this verse is not the same as the above verse (8); the context is indicative of their meaning.
@12
<b>Hatred arouses quarrels</b> Even a sin that was forgotten is remembered though additional iniquities. The final hatred comes and arouses them, for Ezekiel reproved Israel for the transgressions of Egypt (Ezek. 20:7), “And I said to them, ‘Every man shall cast away the abominations of his eyes, etc.’” How many (years was) this hatred hidden, that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not mention it to them until now, when they added transgressions to their sins.

@13

@20
<b>The tongue of the righteous is choice silver</b> for he knows how to reprove.
<b>the heart of the wicked is worth little</b> for he does not heed the reproof of the righteous man. Midrash Rabbi Tanhuma (Ki Thissa 6) states: This was stated concerning Iddo the prophet, who called [in prophecy] about the altar in Beth-El, and Jeroboam, although his hand had become stiff, did not heed the reproof, as it is said (I Kings 13:6): “Entreat now the Lord your God, etc.”; but not “my God, etc”; (ad loc.): “and the king’s hand was drawn back to him, and it was as before.” Just as before, he was standing and burning sacrifices to idols, so was it at the end.

<b>A righteous man is extricated from trouble</b> when the wicked man dies, and this is connected to the preceding verse.
@9
<b>With his mouth, the flatterer</b> The flatterer who entices his friend on an evil way, destroys him with his mouth.

[This appears to mean a weir in several dialects; i.e., a fence placed in the water to catch fish.] Manuscripts of Rashi yield: eclusse or esklusa, which is e’cluse [in modern French]; in German wasserschleuse, a lock or a sluice gate).

@6
<b>but wickedness brings ruin upon the sinner</b> Heb. חטאת, lit. sin. Like חטאת, a sinner, but since he is completely wicked, he calls him חטאת, sin. The meaning is that his wickedness will bring ruin upon the sinner and humble him. Every expression of סלוף means ruin and stumbling, like (below 19:3) “A person’s foolishness ruins (תסלף) his way,” and brings evil upon him.
@7
<b>There is one who feigns riches</b> He shows himself to be rich. Another explanation: There is a man who becomes rich in the end but has nothing in the beginning, and there is one who comes to poverty from great riches. Another explanation: There is one who becomes wealthy by robbing the poor, but in the end he has nothing, and there is one who becomes poor by scattering his money and giving it to the poor, but great wealth is in store for him.
@8
<b>The ransom of a man’s soul is his wealth</b> A man’s wealth is the ransom of his soul, for he performed charity with it.
<b>as long as the poor man has not heard a rebuke</b> As long as he does not let the poor man hear a rebuke, i.e., he gives to him and does not embarrass him. Another explanation:
<b>The ransom of a man’s soul is his wealth</b> His Torah.
<b>but a poor man</b> in the words of Torah,
<b>did not hear a rebuke</b> He does not know to turn away from evil, since he is not cautious. The Midrash Aggadah interprets it as speaking of the half-shekel, which Scripture levied on all Israel and made the poor and the rich equal in that respect—so that the poor does not hear a rebuke from the rich, saying to him, “My share is greater than your share in the public sacrifices.”

<b>Hope deferred</b> He relies on his friend and does nothing.
<b>makes the heart sick</b> Heb. מחלה, brings sickness to the heart. This מחלה is not a noun like (Ex. 23:25): “And I will remove sickness (מחלה) from your midst,” but like (Lev. 11:6): “bringing up (מעלת) the cud.”
<b>but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life</b> lit. but a tree of life is a desire fulfilled. This is inverted; i.e., a desire fulfilled is like a tree of life. The hope that the Holy One, blessed be He, had hoped for Israel and looked forward for them to repent—brought them ultimately to heartsickness when they did not repent. And when His desire is fulfilled—that they comply with His will—it is a tree of life to them.
@13
<b>He who despises a thing will be pledged to it</b> Heb. יחבל. He who despises one of the words of the Torah will ultimately be taken for it as a pledge.
<b>but he who reveres a commandment will be rewarded</b> lit. will be paid. He will receive a reward. Midrash Tehillim expounds: “He who despises a thing will be pledged to it” concerning David, who said before the Holy One, blessed be He, “Of what use are the madmen that You created?” He replied, “By your life, you will ultimately need madness.” When he came before Achish to feign madness, “and he let his saliva run down upon his beard, etc.” (I Sam. 21:14).

<b>fulfilled</b> Heb. נהיה, lit. is. Another explanation:
<b>a desire fulfilled</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, desires that Israel do His will, and when His desire is fulfilled, it pleases Him. And it is the abomination of the wicked that they turn away from their evil to gratify their desire.
@20

@23
<b>An abundance of food is the result of the plowing of the poor</b> I saw in the great Masorah [on the words רב אכל]: The word רב appears thirty-three times with a “kamatz,” but this one has a short “kamatz,” and it is joined to the word אכל, food, with a “makkaf” (hyphen); and I saw there that אכל is vowelized with a “pattah” (i.e., a “segol” which is a small “pattah”), and it is accented on the first syllable, as in (Gen. 41:35): “all the food (אכל) of the good years.” According to its vowelization, this is its interpretation: Much grain comes to the world through the plowing of the poor people; i.e., much Torah emanates from pupils whose teachers learn from them through their debate concerning the halachah.
<b>and some perish</b> And many of them perish from the world because [they have] no propriety, for they do not behave properly; and concerning the grain, some grain suffers because of its owner, who does not separate its tithes and its gifts for the poor as is proper. Our Sages explained in tractate Hagigah (4b) “And some perish without justice,” concerning the messenger of the angel of death, who changes one name for another and causes the death of one whose time has not come. But, if it [this explanation] is so, the end of the verse has nothing to do with its beginning.

<b>Amends for guilt plead for the fools</b> For they sin and have to give money to the one against whom they sinned. And their amends, which they bring him with their money, will plead for them, like the Philistines, as it is stated (I Sam. 6:4f.): “five hemorrhoids of gold, etc. and you shall give honor to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lighten His hand from upon you.” אשם (amende in French, geldstrafe in German) a fine.

@10

@12
<b>There is a way that seems right to a man</b> He commits a transgression and says, “There is no transgression in it.” Another explanation:

@14
<b>The one with an impure heart shall have his fill from his ways</b> Esau.
<b>and above him is a good man</b> Jacob.
@15
<b>A fool believes</b> their words and is enticed after them. Another explanation:
<b>with laughter the heart aches</b> It is sport for a fool to carry out a sinful plot (above 10:23), and ultimately, his heart will ache. The one with an impure heart is a wicked man, as in (below 26:23) “Impure (סיגים) silver.” סיג is the name of the dross. סוג is the silver mixed with the dross.
<b>and above him is a good man</b> And above the wicked man will be the righteous man.

Therefore, they hated him, and he was called a poor man because he would spread false rumors about them and look for statements that were not true (לא המה). We read לו, “to him,” for he would pursue statements for his own benefit, and in Joseph’s matter, they were his, because his slander returned upon him. He would say that they ate limbs from a living animal, but Scripture testifies about them that even in the time of sin, they would slaughter a kid, as it is said: (Gen. 37:31) “and they slaughtered a kid.” He would say that they degraded the sons of the maidservants. Therefore, Joseph was sold as a slave. He would say that they gazed upon the women of the land.

When you expound on the account of the Merkavah or on the account of the Creation, or on the statutes written in the Torah—like the statutes and things that Satan denounces and refutes, such as eating pork, mingled species in a vineyard, and shaatnes—you should not search, but only conceal [the reason] and say, “It is the King’s decree.”

[Bracketed words appear in Salonica edition only.] According to its homiletic interpretation, do not accustom yourself to sin inadvertently and to constantly bring sin- offerings and guilt-offerings to the house of the Lord, Who is called a friend to Israel, as it is written (Song 5:16): “This is my beloved and this is my friend.”

Now this is its interpretation: A worn-out garment on a cold day is like vinegar on chalk.

Slander causes the countenance of the Holy One, blessed be He, to be angry, and this is the comparison [of the interpretation] of the verse.

The parable states, ‘Thighs seem raised to a lame man.’”

[According to] Midrash Aggadah, ושכר כסיל is from an expression of (Gen. 8:2) “And the fountains of the deep were closed (ויסכרו),” and an expression of (Isa. 19:10) “who make dams (שכר).” The Holy One, blessed be He, closes up the constellation of Orion (כסיל), which serves in the summer from Tishri on, and from then on, He closes off all who traverse the sea from going into it until Passover. And in the words of Rabbi Moses, I saw: רב מחולל כל, A wealthy man has many activities, and if he hires a fool, it is as though he is hiring all wayfarers who witness the deterioration of the work, to instruct how to rectify it and how he should work.

Another explanation. זקים, frondeles in Old French, slings, from an expression of slingstones (Zech. 9:15), and so in the Talmud (Baba Mezia 94a) זיקתא פסוק לן, “slingers are assigned to us.” He shoots arrows and death.

<b>and he who rolls a stone</b> He rolls it from place to place so that people will stumble on it. The Aggadah (Tanhuma Buber, Vayera 28, see footnote 157) interprets it in reference to Abimelech, who slew his seventy brothers on one stone and his end was that he died by a stone, as it is said (Jud. 9:53): “And a certain woman cast a piece of an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull.”

If one shows himself to be sated, that he has no desire for words of the Torah as a desire of his soul, he tramples honeycomb.

Besides this, it appears in the midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (Balak 15) as regards Balaam, who blessed Israel with a loud voice, as it is stated (Num. 23:7): “And he took up his discourse, etc.,” an expression of raising the voice, and he later counseled to cause them to sin.

<b>For riches are not forever</b> and thereby, he eats the fruit, and the principal remains.
<b>When the hay is carried away</b> When his laws are disseminated and the Torah is magnified through him, then these lambs will be his clothing, and the disciples shall be to him for a name and for raiment of glory and beauty.

<b>Men of evil do not understand judgment</b> They do not give attention to the ultimate retribution, that they should think about it and repent of their way and be saved.

<b>He who admonishes man</b> for the sins he has committed and separates him from them.
<b>afterwards will find more favor</b> After a time, he will find more favor in his eyes than one who speaks with flattery. We find in Gen. Rabbah (44:5): “Wherever it says אחרי, it means only long after; אחר, it is soon after. In Tanhuma, in the portion entitled “These are the words”: “He who admonishes man after Me”—this refers to Moses, who admonished Israel after the Holy One, blessed be He, who were called “man,” as it is stated (Ezek. 34:31): “You are men,” and it stated concerning him (Ex. 33: 17): “For you have found favor in My sight.”
<b>more favor than he who speaks with flattery</b> This refers to Balaam, who said fine things to Israel (Num. 24:5): “How goodly are your tents, O Jacob!” Moses announces (Deut. 11:16): “Beware lest your heart be deceived,” and Balaam announces and flatters, “Do what your heart desires; He does not care: (Num. 23:19) ‘God is not a man that He should lie,’ concerning the nations, but concerning you, ‘He says but He does not do.’” And Solomon cries about both of them, (above 27:6): “Wounds of a lover are faithful, whereas kisses of an enemy are burdensome.”

Our Sages, however, said: “He who says, ‘This tradition is acceptable, I will learn it, but this one is not acceptable, I will not learn it.’” The support [for this view] from the verse is that זונות throughout the Scriptures is not spelled fully [with two “vavim”] except this once only.
@4
<b>establishes the country</b> If he is an honest judge, he establishes the country.
<b>but a haughty man</b> Heb. תרומות, a haughty man, who does not care to take time in judgment. Our Rabbis (Keth. 105b) stated: “If the judge is like a king, who does not have to acquire friends and accept bribes, he establishes the country. But if he is like a priest, who asks for terumoth in the threshing floors, he tears it down.”

@9
<b>a wise man contends</b> Heb. נשפט, debates with the fool.
<b>he will have no contentment</b> Whether he shows him an angry countenance or he shows him a laughing countenance, there is no contentment either in this or in that. He finds no satisfaction. We find in the case of Amaziah that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him a laughing countenance and delivered Edom into his hands, and when he returned from defeating them, (11 Chron 25:14) “he brought their (sic) gods, etc. and prostrated himself before them.” To Ahaz, the Holy One, blessed be He, showed an angry countenance and delivered him into the hands of the kings of Aram (ibid. 28:23): “And he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, etc. for he said, ‘The gods of Aram are helping them.’”
@10
<b>seek his soul</b> [This is] an expression of love, and it appears that it is so, as David said to Abiathar (I Sam. 22:23): “for he who seeks my soul seeks your soul.” He who will deal kindly with me will deal kindly with you. The exegetes, however, do not agree with me.
@11
<b>will quiet it</b> When the fool has let out all his wind, the wise man comes and humbles it with the reply of his mouth. Similar to this is (Ps. 65:8): “Who stills (משביח) the noise of the seas”; (ibid. 89: 10): “when its waves rise up, You still (תשבחם) them.”

<b>If one pampers his slave from childhood</b> [This refers to] the evil inclination.

@22

Another explanation: According to its apparent meaning, if a person is stingy and fears that if he gives charity he will require help from people, this fear will be a snare for him. I prefer the former [interpretation], however.

<b>the words of the man concerning, “God is with me;</b> said the man that is Solomon this prophecy concerning himself because of איתיאל because he relied on his wisdom to increase gold, horses and wives, which he was forbidden to increase, and so he said, “God is with me, and I will be able. I will increase wives, and they will not turn my heart away; I will increase gold, and I will not turn away; I will increase horses, and I will not take the people back to Egypt.”
<b>yea, God is with me, and I will be able”</b> Since he said, “God is with me, and I will be able to do it, and I will not stumble.” לאיתיאל, because of “God is with me,” as in (Ex. 14:3): “For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel (לבני),” meaning of the children of Israel.

@10
<b>Do not inform</b> Do not deliver your case against a person to complain about him to the Holy One, blessed be He, even if he is wicked, who curses his father and possesses all the abominations mentioned here, and the proof of the matter is from Hosea son of Beeri, as is stated in Pesachim (87b) in the #entitled “The Woman,” that he informed on lsrael and said, “Exchange them for another nation.” Replied the Holy One, blessed be He, “Go, take yourself a wife of harlotry” (Hos. 1:2).

We learn that it is Arabic, but the commentators say that it is an expression of the grave and the descent. Indeed, we learn this in Midrash Psalms (31:9), which interprets the “two daughters” as Paradise and Gehinnom. This one says, “Give me righteous people!” and this one says, “Give me wicked people!”

<b>the mother’s wrinkles</b> Heb. ליקהת, the wrinkles that gather (נקהין) in his mother’s face, from the expression of (Gen. 49:10): “a gathering (יקהת) of peoples.” The “yud” is a radical, like יפעת, splendor; (יעלת חן) (Prov. 5:19), a graceful mountain goat.
<b>pick it out</b> Heb. יקרוה, an expression of (Num. 16: 14): “will you pick (תנקר)” (Ex. 33:22) “In the cleft (בנקרת) of the rock.” Forer in French, to bore through. Let the raven, which is cruel to its young, come and pick it and not eat it and not derive benefit from it, and let the eagle, which is compassionate with its young, come and eat it and derive benefit from it. The raven is cruel, as it is stated (Ps. 147:9): “to the young ravens which cry,” and the eagle is compassionate, as it is stated (Deut. 32: 11): “It bears its young on its wing.”

<b>and the king against whom no one dares to rise up</b> Heb. ומלך אלקום I do not know what it is according to its simple meaning, but the Aggadic midrashim interpret these five sections of four as corresponding to the four kingdoms. Since their rule over Israel was strengthened because of the iniquity of having transgressed the five Books of the Pentateuch, Scripture mentions them five times.
<b>[16] The grave and the barren womb</b> The grave represents the kingdom of Babylon, for it is stated regarding Nebuchadnezzar (Hab. 2:5): “who widened his desire like the nether- world.” And the barren womb, that is Media, in whose time mercy (רחמים) was held back from Israel, as it is said (Esther 3:13): to destroy, kill and cause to perish.”
<b>the earth, which is not sated with water</b> This represents Greece, which was not sated with issuing decrees on Israel.
<b>and fire, which does not say, “Enough!”</b> Corresponding to Esau, who acted with burning wrath against Israel, for he said to destroy children and women in one day. And likewise...
<b>[19] The way of the eagle</b> This is Babylon, the great eagle, with the long wings (Ezek. 17:3).
<b>the way of a ship in the heart of the sea</b> This represents Greece, who was swift with its decrees.

<b>the way of a man with a young woman</b> This represents Edom, who said, “I will be a mistress forever.” [גבר is interpreted as גברת, a mistress, and בעלמה as לעולם, forever.]
<b>[20] So is the way of an adulterous woman</b> The people of Israel brought this evil upon themselves because they played the adulteress with idolatry, and they deserved that the retribution should befall them.
<b>[21] the earth quakes</b> This refers to Eretz Israel.
<b>and she says, “I have no committed no sin.”</b> As it says (Jeremiah 2:35), “Behold, I contend with you concerning because you say, I have not sinned.” (Until this point are the words of Rashi [as they appear] in Mikraoth Gedoloth.)
<b>under a slave</b> This refers to Nebuchadnezzar, who was the slave and secretary of Merodach-baladan, as appears in Hullin. [To my knowledge, this does not appear in Hullin, but in Helek, the eleventh #of Sanhedrin, 96a.]
<b>and a wretch who is sated with food</b> This refers to Ahasuerus, who made a banquet for one hundred and eighty days

<b>[26] The hyraxes are a people not strong</b> This refers to Media and Persia.
<b>yet they prepare their food in the summer</b> [This refers to] Nebuchadnezzar, who performed one [act of] honor to the Holy One, blessed be He, in the days of Merodach-baladan, when he sent letters to Hezekiah, and wrote therein, “Peace to King Hezekiah; peace to city of Jerusalem; peace to the great God.” Nebuchadnezzar was the one who wrote his letters, but he was not there that day, and when he came and they told him what they had done, he responded, “You call Him the great God, yet you address Him last!” He ran after the messenger and brought him back. For that [act of] pursuit, he merited the kingship. This is how he “prepared his bread in the summer,” like the ant.
<b>yet they make their home in the rock</b> For they built the Temple.
<b>[28] The spider grasps with its hands</b> This refers to Esau, as it is stated (Gen. 27:22): “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
<b>in a king’s palaces</b> That he [Esau] entered the Temple of the King and destroyed it.
<b>[30] The lion is the mightiest of the beasts</b> This is Nebuchadnezzar, as it is stated (Jer. 4:7): The lion has come up from his thicket.”

Just as pressing milk gives out butter, so will pressing anger that your mentor is wroth with you for not understanding readily and you were put to shame because of it, eventually bring out of your mouth after a time many (רבות) halachoth and instructions.

<b>[16] She contemplates a field</b> Heb. זממה. The Torah muzzles Esau, the “man of the field,” with a muzzle and a bridle.
<b>and purchases it</b> lit. and takes him from the world to destroy him;
<b>from the fruit of her deeds she plants a vineyard</b> Israel, to keep them alive for the fire of the world to come.
<b>[18] She advised</b> Its speech.
<b>her lamp does not go out at night</b> It is written בליל, with the “hey” missing; on the night of watching (ליל שמורים), when the Egyptians were plagued, it shone for Israel and protected them.
<b>[19] onto the distaff</b> Heb. בכישור, through the skill of its deeds.
<b>support the spindle</b> Heb. פלך, a support, as in (II Sam. 3:29): “one who leans on a staff (מחזיק בפלך).”
<b>[20]She spreads out her hand</b> Whoever makes himself like a poor man on its account—in him it [the Torah] endures.
<b>[21] She fears not for her household for snow</b> with which they judge the wicked from fire to snow.
<b>dressed in crimson</b> The covenant of the blood of circumcision. Another explanation: They are dressed with the commandments expressed in double language. (Deut. 15:10): “You shall surely give (נתון תתן),” (ibid. verse 8): “you shall surely open (פתוח תפתח),” (ibid. verse 14): “you shall surely furnish him liberally (הענק תעניק).” All these save them from the snow of Gehinnom. So it is expounded in Tanhuma.
<b>[24] She makes a cloak</b> It grants a glorious [raiment] to the Sages.
<b>and she gives a belt to the trafficker</b> To the one who is girded with its merchandise, she gives a belt for their loins.
<b>[25] to the last day</b> They need not grieve over the day of judgment because they will be saved from it, and all the days of their life they will rejoice at the day of judgment. An expression of צחוק, laughter, applies to anyone who need not be concerned, as in (Job 41:21): “and he rejoices at the din of a spear.”
<b>[27] She supervises the ways of her household</b> The Torah teaches them the good way, to separate from sin.
<b>[28] Her children</b> The pupils.
<b>her husband</b> The Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>[30] Charm is false</b> [The charm] of the kings of the nations.

<b>There was a man in the land of Uz</b> This means in the land of Aram, as it is written (Gen. 22: 21): “Uz, his firstborn,” of the sons of Nahor.
<b>and that man was</b> Although that is a future expression, that is the style of the Hebrew language, and the proper expression for it is “Now that man was greater than all the children of the land of the East”; the children of the land of the East, for Aram is in the east of the world, as it is stated (Num. 23:7): “From Aram has Balak, king of Moab, brought me, from the mountains of the East.” Another explanation: Uz is Job. Buz is Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite. This is what Job said (31:34): “and the most contemptible of families shatters me.” This one (the Buzite) who shatters my words is of my family. This is what people say: “From the very forest, the ax handle is formed.” Another explanation:
<b>in the land of Uz</b> In the land whence they take evil counsels against the Holy One, blessed be He. As it is stated (Gen. 10:11): “Out of that land Asshur went forth.” Now what counsel did they take? “He has no right to take the upper worlds and to give us the lower world.” Instead, come to the land of Shinar, where there are many gods, concerning which it is stated: “for it is a land of graven images” (Jer. 50:38): “And let us make a tower whose top shall reach to the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves” (Gen. 11:4). The word “name” stated here refers only to idolatry, as it is stated (Exod. 23:13): “You shall not make mention of the name of other gods.” What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He sat in judgment over them and stood up witnesses against them, as it is stated (Gen. 11:5): “And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower.” Now does the Omnipresent have to come down to see? Is it not written: “The eyes of the Lord are roving to and fro throughout the entire earth”? Rather, it is to teach a ruling to future generations, that judges may not pass judgment except with eyewitnesses, as it is stated (Lev.5:1): “Having seen or known.”
<b>was</b> Heb. והיה. According to its simple meaning, it is like ויהי, and its meaning is both past and future.
<b>sincere and upright</b> But [I could think] that as regards matters between him and his Maker, he was not righteous. Therefore, it is stated: God- fearing and shunning evil.
@3
<b>seven thousand sheep</b> He counted the largest number first.
<b>greater than all the children of the East</b> Than the generation of the division, as it is written (Gen. 11:2): “And it came to pass as they migrated from the east.” But concerning Abraham, it is not so, for concerning Abraham, it is written הגדול, the greatest, as it is stated (Josh. 14:15): “And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-Arba; he was the greatest man among the “Anakim.” It should have said אדם גדול, a great man. Why did he write האדם הגדול, the greatest man? By this, Scripture hinted that he was a great man who passed ten tests. Therefore, his title is written with two “heys”, the numerical value of which is ten. Job, however, described by the word גדול, greater, passed only one [test], as it is stated: sincere and upright, etc., that out of that entire generation, he was not apprehended for that iniquity.
@4
<b>Now his sons would go and make a feast in each one’s house on his day</b> In the house of each one on his day.
<b>and they would send and invite</b> Heb. ושלחו וקראו, like ושולחים וקוראים, that they would do so constantly.
@5
<b>Now it would come about when the cycle of the feasting days would be over</b> When the days of the feasting would be over, Job would act in this manner; upon every termination of the seven days on which the days of feasting rotated, he would send and summon them (ויקדשם) ; i.e., he would prepare them and summon them, as in (Num. 11:18). “Prepare yourselves for tommorow.”
<b>and offer up... early in the morning</b> The meaning is that he would offer up burnt-offerings early. Therefore, Scripture wrote in the future tense, that he was wont to do so always at the end of every seven days.
<b>the number of all of them</b> The sons and the daughters.
<b>and blasphemed</b> Heb. וברכו, lit. will do. A euphemism [used in] referring to the Most High.
<b>So would Job do</b> Heb. יעשה, lit. will do. He would always do in this manner. When Scripture writes about a constant occurrence, sometimes it writes in the past tense, and sometimes in the future tense.
@6
<b>Now the day came about</b> That day which was Rosh Hashanah, (known as a day of sounding the shofar, and the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded the Adversary to bring the merit and the guilt of all creatures. This is the meaning of “from going to and fro on the earth.”)
<b>and the angels of God came to stand beside the Lord</b> to contend with Him, because the expression of standing refers only to judgment, as it is stated (Isa. 3:13): “The Lord stands to plead.”
<b>and the Adversary, too, came among them</b> to accuse the people.
@7
<b>“From going to and fro on the earth and from walking in it.”</b> So is my wont to go to and fro, to see the evil ones and the good ones. Now I went to and fro throughout the entire earth and I did not find anyone like Abraham, about whom it is said (Gen. 13:17): “Rise, go to and fro in the land.” The Sages of blessed memory (Baba Bathra 16a) said that the Adversary meant this for the sake of Heaven, in order that Abraham’s merit not be forgotten by our God.
@8
<b>Have you paid attention to My servant Job</b> that you should desire to denounce him?
@9
<b>“Does Job fear God for nothing?”</b> This is a question.
@10
<b>Haven’t You made a hedge around him</b> Because he knows that You visit him frequently to perform miracles for him, and he is fruitful and multiplies; therefore he performs all these righteous deeds—but You have not tested him.
@11
<b>But</b> were you to touch all that he has, would he not blaspheme You to Your face immediately? This is a question. And then, the Lord said to the Adversary, “Behold, all that he has is in your hands.”
@12
<b>“Behold, all that he has etc.</b> Another explanation:
<b>[6] Now the day came about</b> That day when they recommenced the cycle [and were] to eat at the house of their eldest brother.
<b>the angels of God</b> The heavenly hosts, which are near the Divine Presence, to be the members of His household, and were therefore called His children.
<b>to stand beside the Lord</b> Heb. Around Him, as (Gen. 45:1) “all who stood around him (עליו).”
<b>[7] “Where are you coming from?”</b> Scripture speaks of etiquette, that the greater one speaks first and permits the smaller one to reply.
<b>“From going to and fro on the earth”</b> As is explained above, and it is in the homiletic section of the chapter [that begins], “The partners.”
<b>[8] “Have you paid, etc.”</b> An expression of a wonder.
<b>sincere and upright</b> Perfect in his deeds.
<b>[10] made a hedge around him</b> You protected him like a wall, as in (Isa. 5:5) “I will remove its hedge (משוכתו),” its wall. Every expression of בעד stated in the Hebrew language is only an expression of “opposite and before him,” as in (Lev.16:6), “and he shall effect atonement for himself (וכפר בעדו),” he shall wipe away the sin from opposite you and before you (sic), so that the atonement shall be a shield about you. Similarly (Ps. 3:4), “[But You,] O Lord, are a shield about me (בעדי) .”
<b>spread out in the land</b> Heb. פרץ, gained strength, as in (Exod. 1:12), “So would they gain strength (יפרץ), which the Targum renders: And so would they become strong. This is its simple meaning, but our Sages of blessed memory stated in the Aggadah (Baba Bathra 15b, 16a) that they broke the fence of the world, for the goats would slay the wolves.
@14
<b>beside them</b> Heb. על ידיהם lit. on their hands. This is an expression of a place only because it is prepared and available at his hand. Our Sages of blessed memory said in the Aggadah (Baba Bathra 15b, 16a), that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them a taste of the world to come; for after the plowing by the she-donkeys, they would sow with the plowing, and the she-donkeys would immediately graze on the young greens from the furrow.
@15
<b>And Sheba</b> The kingdom of Sheba fell upon them and encamped beside them, as in (Gen. 25: 18), “before all his brethren he settled.”
<b>the youths</b> Your servants who were guarding them.
<b>and I... escaped</b> Heb. ואמלטה. The word מליטה is only an expression of withdrawal, that one withdrew from trouble.
@16
<b>and the youths</b> Scripture speaks of the guards of the flocks.
@17
<b>spread out on the camels</b> This is an expression of plundering plunder according to their custom that as long as they are walking, they stick together and walk stealthily lest people recognize them and drive the cattle away. When they reach the place of the cattle, they spread out in the width of the herd, one on each side, in order to gather the cattle. Now these messengers were messengers of the Adversary, and in order to provoke him [Job] and cause him to sin, they first informed him of a small loss and later of a larger one. So is the sequence of all of them.
@19
<b>from the other side of the desert</b> From the other side of the desert, for the house was on this side. This is the meaning of עֵבֶר, as it is found in Scriptures.
<b>upon the youths</b> The sons, but it is unnecessary to mention the daughters.
(<b>to tell you</b> He was permitted only to tell, and at that moment, he died. Not found in certain editions.)
@20
<b>tore</b> Heb. ויגז, tore out, as in (Jer. 7:29), “Tear out (גזי) your hair for your great men,” which Jonathan renders: תלישה tear out, and like (Ps. 71:6) “From my mother’s womb You pull me (גוזי),” pull me.
@21
<b>From my mother’s womb</b> the earth, “whence I was taken,” or actually, “my mother.”
<b>and I will return there naked</b> He is not referring to the womb. What then is the meaning of “there”? To the place of his return, for which he is destined, and he will not change the law, to return anywhere but to the earth. Therefore, it was not necessary to mention it.
@22
<b>unseemliness</b> Heb. תפלה. He did not ascribe any blemish or unseemliness to the Holy One, Blessed be He. Similarly (Jer. 23:13), “And in the prophets of Samaria I saw unseemliness (תפלה).”
<b>neither did he ascribe</b> Heb. נתן lit. gave, to ascribe unseemliness and injustice to the Holy One, blessed be He, like (I Sam. 18:8) “They ascribed (נתנו) to David ten thousands, and to me they ascribed (נתנו) the thousands.”
#2
@2
<b>“Where are you coming from?”</b> Where is the place about which you may say, “From this place I come”?
@3
<b>maintains</b> Heb. מחזיק, holds, as in (Exod. 4:4) “and he held (ויחזק) onto it”; (Prov. 26:17), “One who holds (מחזיק) onto a dog’s ears.”
<b>Yet you enticed Me against him</b> You enticed Me to destroy him. Every expression of הֲסָתָה is only an expression of attracting a person to his counsel.
@4
<b>Skin for skin</b> One limb for another limb. It is human nature that, when one sees a sword coming toward his head, he protects it with his arm in front of it. Surely a person will give all the money he has.
<b>for his life</b> For his life to protect it. Because this person knows that he is liable to lose his life, he does not worry about his money.
@5
<b>But</b> Heb. אולם, but.
<b>will he not</b> Will You not see immediately that he will blaspheme You to Your face?
@6
<b>but preserve his life</b> that it does not go out. From here the Sages said, “The Adversary’s pain was greater than Job’s. This is analogous to one saying to his friend, ‘Break this barrel but preserve its wine.’”
@8
<b>to scratch himself with</b> Heb. להתגרד.This word is spelled with a “dalet.” It is a Mishnaic expression (Rosh Hashanah 27b): “If he scraped it (גרדו) and reduced it to its normal size,” but גורר with a “reish” is only an expression of dragging, like (Shabbath 29b), “A person may drag a bed or a bench.”
@9
<b>maintain</b> Heb. מחזיק, hold.
<b>and die</b> Heb. ומת. This is an imperative expression, as (Deut. 32: 50), “And die on the mountain.”
@10
<b>also</b> Is it not enough that He created us? Should we also accept the good, but not accept the evil? This is a wonder.
<b>with his lips</b> but in his heart he did sin.
@11
<b>Job’s three friends</b> Heb. רעי, those who loved him.
<b>to bemoan</b> Heb. לנוד, as in (Isa. 51:19): “who will lament (ינוד) for you?”; (Jer. 22:10), “neither bemoan (תנדו) him.”
@12
<b>but they did not recognize him</b> because his face had changed as a result of the agonies.
<b>towards heaven</b> i.e., high over their heads. That was their mourning custom.
@13
<b>on the ground</b> On the ground, to share his pain.
#3
@1
<b>Job’s Address</b><br><b>Now Job raised his voice</b> Heb. ויען, he cried out, for every expression of עניה in the Torah is only an expression of raising the voice, and the “father” of them all is (Deut. 27:14): “The Levites shall raise their voices (וענו) etc. with a loud voice.”
@2
<b>in which I was to be born</b> This is a future expression, that he was saying, “Would that the day in which I was destined to be born be lost, and then I would not have been born.”
<b>and the night</b> That too should have been lost.
<b>when one said</b> that the reporter, upon whom it was incumbent [to report] would say.
<b>“A man has impregnated.”</b> That my father impregnated my mother. Concerning a female, it is customary to say הרתה, she conceived, and concerning a male, it is customary to say, הורה, he impregnated the female.
<b>and the night when one said</b> This is one of the places where Scripture abbreviates its words because it is unnecessary to explain who [the subject] is, and the expression means, “the sayer said.” [Similar to this is (Amos. 6:12), “Will horses run on the rock, or will one plow with cattle?” He should have said, “Will a man plow with cattle?”] However, our Sages said, “The angel appointed over conception is named Laylah.”
@3
<b>May that day be dark</b> constantly; every year, when that day arrives.
<b>let God not seek it from above</b> for good.
<b>and let no light shine upon it</b> Heb. נהרה,light, like צהר, which is translated נהור.
@4
<b>defile it</b> Heb. יגאלהו, like (Malachi 1:7), “defiled (מגאל) bread”; “How have we defiled You (גאלנוך)?” an expression of contamination.
<b>the shadow of death</b> Heb. צלמות, the shadow of death, darkness that never lights up.
<b>like demons of the day</b> Heb. כמרירי, demons who rule at noon, like (Deut. 32: 34), “Ketev Meriri,” who rules at noon; as it is stated (Ps. 91:6): “from Ketev, who rules at noontime.”
@5
<b>it shall not rejoice among the days</b> Heb. אל יחד, it shall not rejoice, as in (Exod. 18:9), “And Jethro rejoiced (וַיִחַד).” (Another explanation is: It shall not join. This does not appear in certain editions.)
@6
<b>lonely</b> Alone and lacking any man or creature.
@7
<b>curse it</b> Heb. יקבהו, curse it, as in (Num. 22:17), “curse (קבה) for me.”
<b>those who curse the day</b> Those who curse their days, since they intend to pronounce a curse because of their anguish.
<b>those destined to be childless in their union</b> Heb. ערר לויתן, to be childless (ערירים) in their union; to join their mate in the union of man and wife, without children. And I saw in the Jerusalem Talmud (Moed Katan 1:5) that עֹרֵר means, to lament their mate when he dies, as in (Moed Katan 1:6): A person may not inspire lamentations (יערער) for his dead relative.
@8
<b>its evening</b> Heb. נשפו, the darkness of its night.
<b>the rays of</b> Heb. עפעפי, rays of, like (Jer. 9:17), “and our eyelids (or pupils) (ועפעפינו) gush water.”
@9
<b>For He did not shut</b> He Who was able to shut. This too is one of the verses that resemble “the night when one said” (verse 2).
<b>the doors of my womb</b> from which I emerged, for had He done so, He would have hidden trouble from my eyes.
@10
<b>Why did I not die from the womb?</b> why was I not ready to die immediately upon my emergence from the womb? He speaks in the future tense, as though he were standing now on the day of his emergence from the womb and saying, “Why will I not die now, and why did I not...
<b>emerge from the belly and perish?”</b> Why was my death not imminent?
@11
<b>Why did knees receive me</b> Why did the knees of my mother receive me before my death?
<b>that I should suck</b> [Why] was it decreed upon me to suck them? As he is speaking on the day of his birth, he mentions those subsequent events in the future tense.
@12
<b>I would be lying</b> Heb. ושכבתי, I would be lying in the grave.
@13
<b>who build ruins for themselves</b> It is customary for those who seek fame to rebuild ruined cities as a memorial for themselves, as in (Isa. 58: 12), “And those coming from you shall be called the repairer of the breaches.” That is to say, with princes and famous people. Or, would that I was unknown, and I would be like a stillborn. What Scripture states: I was not like a hidden stillborn, is because it continues with the language with which it started to speak, viz. in the interrogative, and it refers to “Why did knees receive me...or why was I not like a hidden stillborn child?”
@15
<b>like infants</b> Heb. כעוללים, infants. He calls them עוללים because they are all play and dirt, like (below 16:15), “And I sullied (ועללתי) with dust,” and like (Jud. 19:25), “and abused (ויתעללו) her the entire night.”
@16

@23

<b>As I have seen</b> that those who plow violence and prepare the iniquity in their thoughts, like a plower who prepares [the field] before sowing, afterwards they sow mischief with their deeds. And I saw that they will reap it—i.e., their evil that comes upon them, and I saw that.

@11
<b>A lion perishes without prey</b> The princes perished like a lion who perishes without food; so did their strength to commit violence dissipate. The word אֹבֵד is not an expression of a man who loses something, but [of a man who has] himself become lost, like (Ps. 119.176), “I have gone astray like a lost (אבד) sheep.” and like (ibid. 31:13), “I was like a lost (אבד) vessel.”

@12
<b>Now a word was conveyed secretly to me</b> He returns to his rebuke with which he has been chastising him till now: Why are you crying? “Remember now who was innocent that perished...As I have seen, etc.” And concerning you a word of prophecy was secretly conveyed to me, [lit. was stolen to me], from the expression like a stolen thing, because the Holy Spirit does not reveal itself to the prophets of the heathens in public. This is analogous to a king who had a wife and a mistress. When he would go to his wife, he would go in public, but to his mistress, he would go clandestinely and stealthily. So it is with the Holy One, blessed be He. Regarding the prophets of the heathens [Scripture states:] (Gen. 20:3), “And God came to Abimelech in the dream of the night,” and similarly (ibid. 31: 24), “And God came to Laban the Aramean in the dream of the night”; to Balaam (Num. 24:4), “who falls, but his eyes are open” [in Gen. Rabbah 52:5 (Num. 22:20), “And God came to Balaam at night”]; to Eliphaz, “in the visions of the night.” But concerning the prophets of Israel it is written (ibid. 12:8): “With him I speak mouth to mouth manifestly and not with riddles.” In Midrash Tanchuma, I found it emended [See Tanchuma Balak 8, Tanchuma Buber Vayishlach 24.] Now [in] the expression, “And my ear grasped a bit of it,” שֶׁמֶץ, means a bit of the spirit of understanding.

@16
<b>It was standing</b> It was standing before me, but I did not recognize its appearance.
<b>a faint voice</b> I heard the sound of faint words. Another explanation: I heard silence and a voice. I heard the voice of the silence, but the silence I did not hear. “Silence” denotes angels reciting praise silently, as [Jonathan] renders (I Kings 19:12): “a still small voice” as: a voice of those praising quietly. Moses heard the silence [i.e., the voice of the angels praising]—from here we deduce that the early prophets heard [lit. used] the voice, whereas the later ones heard an echo, like a man who hits with a hammer, and the echo resounds far away. From here... far away. Here it is written: silence and a voice, whereas concerning Elijah it is written: a still small voice; because Eliphaz heard only the silencing of the voice, like a person who shouts into a barrel, that the voice of the barrel shouts toward him. That is an echo, not the voice itself, but concerning Elijah if is written: a still, small voice, for he heard the voice itself] And this is what it said.

<b>Their haughtiness, which is absorbed within them does it not leave [them]?</b> Heb. יתרם בם, like (Isa. 15:7), “Because of haughty things (יתרה) they did.” Their haughtiness and their wisdom, which is absorbed into their body—behold it will move away and be uprooted from them, like (ibid. 33: 20), “whose pegs shall never be moved (יסע).”

@4
<b>May his sons distance themselves from salvation</b> This is the curse with which I cursed him.
<b>and may they be crushed</b> It is punctuated with a dagesh: וְיִדַּכְּאוּ, and may they be crushed, but if it was punctuated without a dagesh (וִידַכְּאוּ), it would mean that they should crush others.

<b>For not from the dust does ruin emerge</b> A plague that comes upon a person is not for nothing, nor does it spring from the ground.
<b>ruin</b> Heb. און. It is an expression of ruin.
@7
<b>Because man is born for trouble</b> For it is impossible that he should not sin and receive trouble as punishment for sin. He is not like the flying creatures—the angels and spirits—who fly upward, and are not of the earthly creatures (other editions read: fly upward so as not to be among the earthly creatures), over whom the Adversary and temptation rule.
<b>flying</b> Heb. רשף, as in (Ps. 76:4), “arrows of (רשפי) a bow.” When the arrow flies, it is called רשפי, an expression of flying. This is what I heard.

@17
<b>Behold, fortunate is the man etc.</b> with pains, and just as He heals the pain of these [people], so would I [myself] appeal to Him about these pains that would come upon me. So should you accept them and not despise them.

@21
<b>from the scourging tongue</b> of the Adversary you shall be hidden. These are the seven troubles: 1 famine, 2) the sword, 3) the tongue, 4) plunder etc., and 5) the beasts of the land, which are brigands.
@23
<b>the stones of the field</b> They are: 6) a type of man.
<b>and the beasts of the field</b> That is what is known as grouse(?) in Old French, and this is actually a beast of the field. In the language of the Mishnah in Torath Kohanim, they are called “adnei hasadeh.”

@24
<b>Then you shall know that there is peace in your tent</b> Then, wherever you are, you will be confident that all is well in your tent.
<b>and you shall visit your habitation and miss nothing</b> Heb. תחטא, like (Jud. 20:16), “at a hairbreadth and not miss (יחטא).” This is the seventh [trouble] that we counted above.
@26
<b>You shall come to the grave at a ripe old age</b> Heb. בְכֶלַח. [In other words,] you will be saved from pestilence. As for the word בְכֶלַח: there is no Biblical support to understand its meaning, but according to the context, it can be interpreted as an expression of the completion of the ripening of the grain, when it is completely ripe. Our Rabbis, however, interpret בְכֶלַח as “sixty years,” according to its numerical value.
<b>as the grain stock is taken away</b> As the grain stack is taken off the ground in its time.

@2
<b>and my calamity</b> my ruin.
<b>placed together on a scale</b> with a weight opposite it. even if [this weight] were the sand of the seas, it would outweigh it.
@3
<b>stammer</b> Heb. לעו. They are uncertain, like a person who has no strength to pronounce a word properly. Likewise (Obad. 16), “And they shall drink and stammer (ולעו),” because it is usual for a drunkard to stammer in his speech.
@4
<b>venom</b> Heb. חמתם, their poison. It was the custom of the Persians to apply snake venom to their arrows.
@5
<b>Does a wild donkey bray</b> That is to say, do I cry out for nothing? Even a stupid animal does not bray when it has food, neither does an ox low unless it does not have grain fodder. With a wild donkey, the expression used is נַהַק, braying, and with an ox, the expression of געיה, lowing.
@6
<b>Can bland food be eaten</b> A thing that has no salt and must be salted, but was not salted, is called תָּפֵל in Mishnaic Hebrew (Shabbath 128a, Hullin 113a, Nedarim 51a).
<b>or is there taste in the saliva</b> that comes from strong tasting foods, for the one who eats a strong-tasting food that increases the saliva, e.g. garlic. That is to say, Do you think their replies that have no substance are acceptable? רִיר [means saliva] as in (I Sam. 2 1:14), “and let his saliva (ריר) run down upon his beard.” חַלָמוּת is like (below 39:4), “Their sons wax strong (יחלמו),” an expression of strength. Some interpret it as an expression of a dream (חלום), but this does not appeal to me because of the dagesh in the “lammed.”
@7
<b>What my body refused to touch</b> That is to say, I have reason to cry increasingly, because things that my body refused [to touch] and was disgusted to touch... [לנגוֹע] is an expression of touching.
<b>as cloths for my food</b> Now they are prepared for me to touch them like my tablecloths upon which my food is placed. כִּדְוֵי is an expression like (II Sam. 10:4), “and he cut off their garments (מדויהם).” I heard this from Rabbi Meshullam the physician. Another interpretation: Like cloths with which they strain the cooked foods and the food runs out of them. דְוֵי is an expression of דָוֶה, running.
<b>my food</b> Heb. לחמי, lit. my bread. All food is called לחם, as in (Dan. 5:1), “made a great feast (לחם).” and as in (Jer. 11:19), “Let us destroy his food (בלחמו) with wood.” which Jonathan renders: poison into his food. Another explanation: They are as the sights of my food. That is to say: I am accustomed to looking at them, at the worms, as I look at my food. This is Mishnaic Hebrew: “and they walk when they look (דוי)” in Tractate Shabbath (53b).
@9
<b>desire</b> and may He want.
<b>and crush me</b> [This is] an expression of death.
<b>enlarge his hand</b> May He enlarge His hand with His plague like (Exod. 9:3), “Behold God’s hand is.”
<b>and finish me off</b> Heb. ויבצעני, and finish me off, as in (Lam. 2:17), “He has carried out (בצע) His word,” and (Zech. 4:9), “and his hands shall finish it (תבצענה).”
@10
<b>Then should I yet have comfort</b> And this shall yet be to me for comfort.
<b>and I will beg, shuddering, that He should have no pity</b> And I will beg of Him with shuddering (Shem Ephraim) that He not refrain from finishing me off: I cannot find any similar word in Scriptures, except that in Mishnaic Hebrew it is an expression of fear and concern, that the hand fears them lest it be scalded in boiling water. That is to say, I will shudder with concern and with shuddering request this.
<b>for I have not denied</b> I did not fail to fulfill His words.
@11
<b>What is my strength</b> How strong is it to bear [my pains]?
<b>that I should wait</b> That I should wait until the day of recovery or until the day of death?
<b>I should wait</b> Heb. איחל, like (Gen. 8:10), “And he waited (ויחל) again,” concerning Noah.
<b>and what</b> Of what importance is my end that I should be able to restrain my desire to bear?
<b>my desire</b> Heb. נפשי. This [word denoting] a person’s temptation toward desire [is used] in many places, as (Gen. 23:8), “If it is truly your will (נפשכם).”
@13
<b>Have I no help</b> This is an expression of wonder. Will this too come upon me, that I have no help? Those friends that I had to help me are not helping me.
<b>or is counsel lost</b> The counsel of counselors is lost from me, because you have risen against me to provoke and to reject.
@14
<b>By one who withholds kindness from his friend</b> Heb. למס, by one who withholds kindness. The “lammed” is a prefix, as in (Num. 26:54), “to the numerous one (לָרַב)”; “to the one who returns (?) (לָשָב),” and (Isa. 28:10, 13) “for a precept (לצו).” מָס too is an expression of a verb, like בָּא, comes: שָב, returns; גָר, dwells; these also are an expression of doing [i.e., the present tense]: who withholds kindness, who destroys it, like (Exod. 16:21), “when the sun grew hot, it melted (ונמס).”
@15
<b>My brethren</b> Those who defend me.
<b>betrayed</b> me like the stream that betrays [many] betrayals, as is explained in this chapter.
<b>like the source of streams</b> the source of streams, they pass from the proper trait of friendship. Now what is the betrayal of a stream?
@16
<b>which wrinkle from the ice</b> if ice comes upon them, they wrinkle and become like boards (Shem Ephraim), and upon them the snow disappears—it is covered, for it falls with the ice. This is one betrayal, for it [the stream] is hidden from the eye, and a thirsty man does not find water to drink.
@17
<b>At the time they become warm</b> Heb. יזרבו, an expression of יְצֹרָבוּ, they become warm from the heat of the sun.
<b>they retreat</b> Heb. נצמתו, retrait in Old French, shrink, contract, as “and the vinegar shrinks them (צומתן), (Pesachim 41a) in Talmudic Hebrew. [In the word יְזֹרָבוּ], the “zaddi” is converted to a “zayin,” like צעקה and זעקה, a cry. [Therefore,] יְזֹרָבוּ is an expression of (Ezekiel 21:3), “and all faces shall be scorched (ונצרבו),” and like (Prov. 16:27), “searing (צרבת) fire.”
<b>they jump</b> they jump from their place.
@18
<b>are held</b> Heb. ילפתו. They hold the paths of their way, as in (Jud. 16:29), “And Samson grasped (וילפת),” and similarly (Ruth 3:8), “and the man quaked and was taken around (וילפת),” for the woman embraced him.
@19
<b>They look at the paths of Tema</b> The land of Ishmael, which is low, and the water flows there.
<b>they make a line</b> Heb. קוו, an expression of an extended line. Another explanation: it is an expression of (Gen. 1:9) “Let the waters...gather (יקוו).”
@20
<b>They are ashamed because they had hoped; they came to it</b> Those who drink it are ashamed because everyone had hoped to drink thereof.
@21
<b>For now you are like it</b> You are compared to that stream

@22

@25
<b>How clear</b> Heb. נמרצו, like (I Kings 2:8), “a clear curse (נמרצת),” an expression of (Prov. 25:11) “a word spoken with proper basis.” and similarly (Ps. 119:103), “How clear (נמלצו) are Your words to my palate.” All of them are expressions of clarification (מליצה), and the “lammed” is converted to a “resh.”
<b>words of uprightness</b> If you were saying words of uprightness, they would be accepted, but now, what does your proof prove? Every expression of תוֹכָחָה in Job means the clarification and verification of matters.
26
<b>Do you think to clarify words</b> Heb. הלהוכח, Do you think to clarify words?
<b>They are like wind</b> They are likened [to wind].
<b>words of futility</b> which have no substance, like (Jer. 2:25), “but you said. I despair (נואש).” I am not concerned with the words of the prophets.

@2
<b>As a slave who longs for the shadow</b> As a slave, who toils all day through and longs and yearns, “When will the shadow of evening come?” And as a hireling, who hopes for his wages at eventide, because the whole day was to him for toil, and he yearns for the sunset.
@3
<b>months of futility</b> and torments, that limited time that is given to man upon earth.

@4
<b>If I would lie down</b> at night, I would hope and say, etc.
<b>and the evening depart</b> When will it become light and when will the time of arising come, and when will the evening depart? [The word מדד ] is an expression of (Gen. 31:40) “and sleep was banished (ותדד).” The “mem” is a defective radical, as in מאמר, statement; משמר, watch.
<b>And I was sated with restlessness</b> I was sated with restlessness on my bed by day until twilight, because, due to the torments I could not sleep until the twilight of day, since my flesh was clothed with worms.
@5

<b>wrinkled</b> Heb. רגע wrinkled, as in (Isa. 51:15), “Who wrinkles (רגע) the sea.” Another explanation: עוֹרִי רָגַע is an expression of resting a wave after a wave, like wrinkles (?).
@6
<b>My days are swifter</b> The days of my prosperity hastened to go away.

<b>and seeing my affliction</b> Heb. וראה. This is not an expression of the imperative, but is an adjective. וראה עניי is badlace (?) in Old French, “that I see it all the time.” As you say (below, at the end of the Book), “וּשְׂבַע יָמִים, and I am sated with days,” like “וְשָׂבֵעַ יָמִים” (with a “kamatz” under the “sin”) so do you say; וּרְאֵה, like וְרוֹאֶה, “and seeing my affliction.”

More than the light of midday, חֶלֶד shall rise for you, i.e., luck and time, like (Ps. 39:6), “and my age (חלדי) is as nothing before You.” Another explanation: יקום חָלֶד: means, The light of your rust shall rise; i.e., your darkest place shall illuminate more than the light of midday. I heard this, but the first [explanation] does not please me (not found in some editions).
<b>your darkness</b> Heb. תעפה. Your darkness shall be like the morning.

It is a noun, ‘madness.’ He leads them away with madness when He wishes to confuse and destroy their wisdom, as in (Isa. 59: 15), “and he who turns away from evil is considered mad (משתולל)”; (Ps. 76:6), “The stouthearted became mad אשתוללוּ.” The “tav” in משתולל and in אשתוללוּ [is inserted because] so is the structure of the Hebrew language: in a word that has a radical “shin” or “sammech,” and which is used in passive or reflexive conjugation, a “tav” is placed after the first radical, like (Ecc. 8:10), “and they will be forgotten (וישתכחו) in the city”; (Micah 6: 16), “For the statutes of Omri are kept (וישתמר)”; (Exod. 9:17), “You still exalt yourself very high (מסתולל) above My people”; (Ecc. 12:5), “and the grasshopper shall drag himself along (ויסתבל).”

@23
<b>He makes nations great and destroys them</b> Heb. משׂגיא. Some say, as He did to the Egyptians when they overtook Israel before Baal-zephon (Exod. 14:9). They erred and said, “You should know that He agreed with us, to drown them in the sea as we decreed, ‘Every son that is born you shall cast into the river’ (ibid. 1:22), and [they also said] that their deity Baal-zephon is mighty, seeing that no acts of judgment were performed upon it, as [they were upon) all the [other] gods of Egypt, and the Omnipresent caused them to be misled in order to drown them. But this explanation is not the main one, for were it so, it should have been dotted on the right, מַשְׁגִיא like שׁוגֶה, the misled. This is the main explanation: It means making great, an expression of שׂגיא כֹח, having great strength. He makes the nations great and causes them to prosper, and their heart becomes haughty with their prosperity, so that [the fact] that they prosper is their destruction.

<b>Will you speak unjustly for God</b> Since you come to contend in the place of God, it is not good that you should speak unjustly.
<b>and will you speak deceitfully for Him?</b> Heb. ולו [usually “to him”]. For His sake will you speak deceitfully? As in (below 33:6), “Behold I am like your mouth for God (לאל),” and like (Deut. 9:28), “to the land that He spoke for them (להם),” for their benefit, and like (Exod. 14:14), “will fight for you (לכם)”; (Jud. 6:31), “Will you contend for the Baal (לבעל)?” (I find it difficult to compare these instances to here [this verse]. Rather, this is analogous to [Num. 17: 5], “through Moses concerning him ]לו[,” concerning Korah.)

If with Heavenly judgment, I will say, “I have sinned.” [because] (Prov. 28:13), “He who conceals his sins will not succeed.” If with earthly judgment, even I will not confess to concealing sin. I did not hear this (absent in some editions).
@21
<b>Distance Your compulsion from upon me</b> Heb. כפי, Your compulsion, as Elihu answered him (below 33:7), “and my compulsion (ואכפי) shall not weigh heavily upon you.” Some interpret כפך as “your hand.” However, it is difficult for me to say that, because we do not find כַּף in the sense of evil, but [meaning] to protect, as in (Exod. 33:22), “And I will cover you with My hand (כפי).”

Like (Ezek. 43:14), “from the bottom (ומחיק) upon the ground”; [and] (verse 13), “the bottom (וחיק) shall be a cubit.” This is the foundation, affishe in Old French, to affix.

@6
<b>Turn away from him</b> during those few limited days and let him rest from pain until he desires, in his old age and the weakness of his strength, the day of his death like a hireling who desires the completion of his day’s work; for his passing from the world is decided and more definite than all passings.
@7
<b>a tree has</b> This [tree] has hope that it will renew itself and its bough will not cease from being a branch.

<b>neither will...bend</b> Heb. יטה, [like] ינטה, like (I Sam. 8:3), “and they turned (ויטו) after gain.” They themselves turned (וינטו). It means that they did not bend from heaven to earth.
<b>the gratification of their desire</b> Heb. מנלם, the granting of their desire and the fulfillment of their plans. It is like two words, מן להם. מן means their preparation, like (Dan. 1:5), “And the king prepared (וימן) for them.” Similar to it is (I Sam. 13:21), “a file (הפצירה פים),” in two words. [The analogy is obscure.] (Isa. 33:7), “Behold I will appear to them (אראלם),” which Jonathan renders: I will appear to them. So it appears to me, and Menachem supports me. Another explanation: מִנְלָם is an expression of (Isa. 33:1), “when you finish (כנלתך) dealing treacherously,” in which the “nun” is a radical that sometimes is omitted, an expression of completion. It will not bend to the ground to be freed from a decree of destruction.

Similarly (II Sam. 1:21), “for there the shield of the mighty was rejected (נגעל).” Its anointing was cast out, and it was as though it had not been anointed with oil, for they were accustomed to anointing the leather shields in order that it be smooth and cause the spear or javelin that strikes it to glide off.

<b>Eliphaz’s reply</b><br><b>Does a man benefit God</b> Will a man avail and benefit for the need and the benefit of the Creator when he teaches the people knowledge and wisdom? The first יִסְכָּן is an expression of benefit [or pleasure], like (I Kings 1:2), “and she shall be to him a warmer (סֹכֶנֶת).” The second is an expression of teaching [or accustoming], like (Num. 22:30), “Have I ever been in the habit (ההסכן הסכנתי)?” The former may also be interpreted as an expression of teaching, thus: Does a man learn for the good of the Creator and for His need when he learns wisdom?

@25
<b>And the Almighty shall be of your adversaries</b> Heb. והיה שד-י בצריך. If this word is holy [i.e., is a reference to the Almighty], I am bewildered at its interpretation, because its meaning is a curse, that He will be counted with his enemies, as in (Jud. 11:35), “and you have become one of those who trouble me (בעכרי),” with those who trouble me. By necessity, we will adjudge it as one of the elliptical verses, [meaning: And the Almighty shall be the Judge over your adversaries. But if we can interpret it as profane, as an expression of a judge and of strength, the following is its interpretation:] And your fortifications (בצריך) shall be strong (שד-י), like “Then you shall make a fortification (בצר) on the earth.” That is, powerful wealth will be fortified, and according to the context, that is indeed its interpretation, as evidenced by the end of the verse, “and you shall have abundant (תועפות) silver,” an expression of strength, like (Num. 23:22), “his is like the power of (כתועפות) a wild ox.”

@30
<b>He shall deliver one who is not innocent</b> Heb. אי נקי, synonymous with אין נקִי, not innocent, like (I Sam. 4:21), “Ichabod (איכבוד),” meaning, there is no glory (אין כבוד). And so (Prov. 31:4), “neither is drunkenness for rulers (אי שכר),” there is no drunkenness (אין שכר). It does not befit them to become intoxicated. Menachem joined the three into one group (Machbereth Menachem p. 22). Although they are two words (?), they explain them thus. And that one who is not innocent will be delivered because of the purity of your hands. So I heard. I heard another version that was being said in the name of Rabbi Jacob: This is an expression of a man who lives in pain and sighing, and the “yud” is superfluous in the word, like (Ps. 123:1), “Who dwells (הישבי) in heaven.” But I did not hear this from the rabbi’s mouth.

<b>Why were the times not hidden from the Almighty?</b> This is a plaint. Why were the times of man’s days not hidden from the Holy One, blessed be He, that He should not know the day of man’s death? Perhaps He would not hasten the retribution, and the day of death would precede it.
<b>And He Who knows him should not see his days</b> Of the day of man, like (Gen. 29:14), “a month of days (ימים),” (which is translated into Aramaic as “from time to time.”) [Another explanation is:] Why are those who are close and who love the Holy One, blessed be He, unable to see the end of His ways and His traits? This [word] ימיו, His days, denotes the way He acted in His time, like (below 27:6), “my heart will not reproach me because of my days.” [See Rashi ad loc.] Now what are the puzzling traits?
@2
<b>[There are some who] remove the landmarks</b> Those who habitually remove the landmarks, who purchase fields adjoining the fields of others, and at night widen their [own] borders by placing their fences at night within the territory of their neighbors. (This is the meaning of removing the landmarks, which is translated into Aramaic as מְשַׁנֶּה, changing, because they would change the boundaries.) And they violently take away a flock and pasture it.

<b>and the wicked gather the plants of the vineyard</b> Heb. יְלַקֵּשׁוּ. And [from] the vineyards of others these wicked men take their fruit; espreinment in Old French. They take their לֶקֶש. לֶקֶש is an expression of a growth of produce, as in (Amos 7:1), at the beginning of the shooting up of the grain, which Jonathan renders. צִמוּחַ, growing. And so did Rabbi Eleazar [Hakalir] establish (in the Hoshanah “Soil from curse”): produce לֶקֶש) from locusts. (Another interpretation: and they delay the vineyard of the wicked. They delay it from destruction, because they eat up [the vineyards] of the poor and the orphans. יְלַקֵּשׁוּ is like (below 29:23), “and they opened their mouth (למלקוש) for a long time,” and like (Gen. 30:42), “and the late ones (לקישיא) were Laban’s.”

<b>They make them lie all night naked</b> They make the poor lie all night.

<b>they embrace the rocks</b> They hide in the crevices in the rocks, and even there the stream flows down and sprays on them, soaking them. רָטוֹב is the Aramaic for לַח wet, and whoever is not dried is called לַח, moist (moite in Old French).
@9
<b>from the breast of the orphan</b> The sucking of the orphan, the source of his food and sustenance, as in (Isa. 60:16), “and the breast of kings you shall suck.”

@10
<b>They made go</b> They made him go without clothing.
<b>and [from] the hungry they carried off the sheaves</b> And from the hungry they took the sheaves of gleaning [which are left for the poor]. It may also be interpreted thus: And those who were carrying the sheaves are hungry, because they were robbed of them and so they remain hungry.
@11
<b>Between their rows they make oil</b> The owners of the olive trees make oil.
<b>they tread the winepresses</b> The owners of the vineyards.

<b>And the eye of the adulterer</b> And the adulterer among them would wait until evening, saying...
<b>a mask</b> And he puts a mask on his face to commit a transgression, for the generation of the Flood was suspected of all these: of robbery, for it is stated (Gen. 6:11): “and the earth was filled with violence,” and of immorality, for it is stated (ibid. verse 12): “for all flesh had corrupted [its way on the earth].”
@16
<b>by day, they lock themselves in</b> Those who are weaker than they, too weak to commit robbery by day, would dig under houses at night; by day they were sealed and closed up in their houses.
<b>they know no light</b> They did not recognize the light because it was not [shining at] the time of their prowling.
@17
<b>For together morning is to them [as] the shadow of death</b> For by day they were locked in, and at night they would go to their tunnel, and they were not at all afraid of the demons.
<b>for he recognizes the terrors of the shadow of death</b> Everyone could recognize the terrifying demons, and he did not fear them. Our Sages, however, explained: By day, they would seal for themselves—By day they would chart the location of the cellar of the house and a rich man’s treasurehouse, for they would deposit balsamum oil with wealthy householders, knowing that he (sic) would put it in his (sic) treasurehouse, and at night they would smell and go there and dig into there.
@18
<b>He is light upon the face of the water</b> When the righteous men, Noah and Methuselah, would rebuke them, they would say, “we are light [enough] to swim on the water, and we have papyrus and light materials from which to make boats and to float.”
<b>their portion in the earth is cursed; he does not turn by the way of the vineyards</b> They would curse their portion in the earth, saying that they would not turn by the way of the good, in the way of the righteous, who are lofty and dwell in the height or the world. Vineyards represent the righteous men and the leaders of the generation, as in (Hosea 2:17), “And I will give her vineyards from there,” which Jonathan renders: her leaders. They would curse their portion in the earth, saying that they would not turn in the way of the good; they would swear that they would not turn their way. Another explanation: תקלל חלקתם בארץ Their portion in the earth was spoiled, for they would destroy their seed in vain, as in (Gen. 6:12), “for all flesh had corrupted its way.” תקלל is an expression of spoiling (קלקול), as in (I Sam. 3:13), “for the iniquity [of the matter] that he knew that his sons were bringing disgrace (מקללים) upon them.” Another explanation: Their portion shall be cursed—the following generations will curse by them: He who requited the generation of the Flood. So I heard. (Gen. Rabbah 30:2). Another explanation:
<b>their portion is cursed; he does not turn by the way of the vineyards</b> They would not accept reproof from the good men. Another explanation: They were swift to sail in ships to kill and to plunder property, but in the way of the land that was inhabited by humans and planted with vineyards they did not care to go.
@19
<b>Dryness and heat they steal away</b> Because of their evil, they caused for themselves that the world should change for one year from its six seasons: sowing, reaping, heat, cold, summer, and winter.
<b>snow water</b> Like: and snow water. This too they stole from the world, because they sinned so that they descended to the grave. In some words, the “vavin” are missing, like (Jer. 11:19), “And I was like a lamb, a bull,” which is interpreted as, a lamb and a bull. There are many more in Machbereth Menachem ben Saruk (p. 26).
@20
<b>The womb forgets him</b> [i.e., the womb of] his mother. Rabbi Tanchum expounded that the generation of the Flood would take their children and place them underneath themselves in order to stop up the windows of the deep, and even his mother would have no mercy on him.
<b>he is sweet to the worms</b> to die, and for the worms to eat their (sic) flesh.
<b>he will no longer be remembered</b> In one year they were [to be] uprooted, but Job was complaining about the reprieve that was given them [the wicked] from the start, for many died and did not see this retribution.
@21
<b>He feeds the barren woman who will not bear</b> so was their custom: One would marry two wives, one for coitus and one for children. The one intended for coitus he would give a potion of roots to drink in order that she should never give birth, and he would feed her delicacies, bathe her, and adorn her, so that she should appear beautiful. The one intended for children he would dress in widow’s garments and starve. This is the meaning of his statement that the barren woman who will not give birth he would feed and adorn, but the “widow,” who was intended for children, he would not adorn.
@22
<b>And He draws</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, [draws] those mighty men with His strength to retribution and to sustenance by the reprieve that He granted them.
<b>he rises</b> one day.

@23

@24
<b>They are taken away in a second</b> They are taken away from the world in a fleeting second.

@25

<b>and make my words as nought</b> [That is, my words] with which I criticize Him to know His standards, that He is slow to anger with the wicked, but He chastises those who love Him as I do, and He does not put them to death, as he complains above (23:17): “Because I was not cut off from before the darkness,” but those who remove the landmarks and commit all these [crimes] were not smitten with suffering.

<b>Bildad’s reply</b><br><b>Dominion and fear</b> Directed towards what Job said (23:4), “I would set out my case before Him,” he says to him, “Dominion and fear are with Him.” “Dominion” refers to Michael, and “fear” refers to Gabriel. Can you answer even one of them?
<b>He makes peace in His heights</b> When the constellations ascend, each one thinks, “I will ascend first,” and because he does not see what is before him, he is not envious. So I heard. [Tanchuma Buber ad loc.] Another explanation: He makes peace in His heights—Fire and water are mixed, and the water does not extinguish the fire; I did not hear this.
@4
<b>How then can man be just...</b> that you said (23:10), “He has tested me that I will emerge like gold.”
@5
<b>He removes the moon</b> Heb. עד, like (28:8), “neither did a lion pass (עדה) over it.” The meaning is that even the moon will be removed from its [source of] light in the future and it will not shine, as it is written (Isa. 24:23): “And the moon shall be ashamed etc.” And the stars will not be pure in His eyes in the future. How much less can man, who is a worm, be just with God!
<b>and will not shine</b> Heb. יאהיל, like (Isa. 13:10), “shall not allow their light to illuminate (יהלו),” and this “alef” serves the same function as (I Sam. 2:33), “and to sadden (ולאדיב) your heart,” in which the “alef” is superfluous. Another explanation: יַאֲהִיל, you will not have shadow. When it does not shine, no shadows are cast. I prefer the former, but I heard both.

<b>His hand caused pain</b> to Pharaoh, who was called the barlike serpent (Isa. 26:1). חללה is an expression of pain and trouble. Likewise, elsewhere (ibid. 51:9): “are you not the one that hewed Rahab and slew (מחוללת), the sea monster?” Another explanation: His hand founded the leviathan, as in (Prov. 8: 25), “before the hills I was created (חוללתי).”

<b>Or will he delight with the Almighty</b> The double interrogative is like all double interrogatives. the first one is customarily prefixed by a “hey” and the second one by אִם ; e.g., (Amos 6:12), “Will horses run (הירצון) on the rock, or (אִם) will one plow with cattle?” (Job 6:30), “Is there (היש) injustice in my tongue, or (אִם) will my palate not understand wickedness?” Here, too, will God hearken to his cry...or will he delight with the Almighty? Will one who is a wicked man or a flatterer perhaps be able to delight and rely on the salvations of the Holy One, blessed be He, and call to Him in time of trouble? This is a question.
@11
<b>I will instruct you</b> what the standard is that is in God’s hand, and the way...

@17
<b>and He will distribute [his] money to the innocent</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, will distribute the wicked man’s money to an innocent one.
@18
<b>He builds...as a moth</b> As a moth, who builds his hole which does not endure, and like a booth that the watchman of the fig tree and the vineyard makes, which is not permanent. (Another explanation: that the watchman of the vineyard, who does not watch it at all times, made. I heard this. Absent in certain editions.)
@19
<b>He dies rich</b> He will die with his riches, but sometimes he will not be gathered in to burial.

@22
<b>And he will cast upon him</b> i.e., the one who casts evil upon him will show no compassion.
<b>from his hand</b> of the wicked man, and from his strength. from his place.

<b>For silver has a mine</b> This, too, is another reason for his first statement that he said (27:6), “I have maintained my righteousness,” for why should I be wicked? If for silver or gold, each one has a source and an end, but from where does wisdom come? This is the end of the chapter; that is the most precious of all. Therefore, all my life, I set my heart on studying it.
<b>and...a place</b> Gold has [a place] whence they refine and smelt it.
@2
<b>and copper is smelted from stone</b> From the mountain the smith smelts the copper. Hence, everything has a beginning and an end, for the whole world will end with all that is therein.
@3
<b>He made an end</b> The Omnipresent [made an end] when there will be darkness, for the heavens shall vanish and the earth shall rot away, and He fathoms the end of everything.
<b>a stone</b> A stone whence darkness and the shadow of death emanate. A stone is the place of the source of trouble. For this reason, a place of trouble is called a stone, like a man who dashes his foot against a stone, who suffers pain. So I heard. This is like (Isa. 34:11), “a line of waste and stones of destruction”; (Dan. 2:45), “that from the mountain a stone was cut.”
@4
<b>A stream burst forth</b> on Sodom and Gemorrah, streams of fire and brimstone.
<b>from the place of its flow</b> Heb. מעם גר, from the place from which it gushes and flows (נוגר).
<b>those who cause the foot to be forgotten</b> These are the people of Sodom, who caused the feet of wayfarers to be forgotten from their land, for they would lay the wayfarer in a bed. If he was too long, they would cut off his feet, and if he was too short, they would stretch him. In this manner it is explained in the Aggadah.
<b>they are lifted up</b> through the bursting forth of the stream, and they are moved away from man.
@5
<b>A land—that from [it] bread emerged</b> its place was as though turned into fire.
@6

@7
<b>A path unknown to brigands</b> Heb. עיט. A band of robbers never passed by them.
<b>and which the eye of a vulture did not see</b> Since it sees more than other birds, and is therefore called רָאָה, because it stands in Babylon and sees a carcass in Eretz Israel. That is how it is explained in the Aggadah of Hullin (632); i.e., spies never discerned it.
@8
<b>neither did... pass by it</b> Heb. עדה, passed, as we translate (Gen. 15 17), “which passed between these parts,” דִּעֲדָה.
<b>Proud beasts</b> Heb. (שַחַץ) and lion (שַחַל) are some of the seven names of the lion (Sanh. 95a: The lion has seven names.) Now what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do?...
@9

@10
<b>In the rocks, He split rivers</b> He refers back to the beginning of his topic, that he said that everything has a source. He split the rocks for the source of the rivers, and so, “His eye saw every precious thing,” whence it would emerge for the creatures, [as He did for Israel; He struck a rock and its water flowed.]
@11
<b>He bound up the depths of the rivers</b> Heb. מבכי. In the Creation of the world, when the lower waters wept (בכו).
<b>the depths</b> Heb. מבכי, like (below 38:16), “the depths of (נבכי) the sea.”
<b>bound up</b> Heb. חבש, like (Gen. 22:3), “and saddled (ויחבש) his donkey.” I did not hear this. [Other editions:
<b>Because of the weeping etc.</b> Because of the weeping of Israel, who were weeping, saying, “What will we drink,” He bound up and fixed for them water from the rock. (Lev. 8:13),”And he fixed hats (ויחבש) for them,” is translated into Aramaic as ואתקין.]
<b>and [from] Taalumah He brings out light</b> There is a window in the firmament, named Taalumah, from which the sun develops in its orbit [in Pirke d’Rabbi Eliezer] (ch. 6). That is to say that everything has a source and an end; only wisdom has no source except from His mouth, and never an end.
@12
<b>But wisdom</b> i.e., Torah.
@13
<b>and it will not be found in the land of the living</b> with one who enlivens himself, but with one who “puts himself to death” with toil and hunger.
@14
<b>The deep says, “It is not in me,”</b> If you ask those who dive into the deep, who deal with pearls, with the source of pearls and with gold and silver mines from the place of the depths of the earth, they will tell you, “It is not in me.” I am not well-versed in halachic instruction.
<b>and the sea says</b> And those who go down to the sea for business will say to you, “Wisdom is not with me.” Why? Because they cannot purchase it like other merchandise, to give of their wealth for its price. And in the Aggadah (see Shabbath 89a), it is stated that at the time of the giving of the Torah, Satan came before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said to Him, “Where is the Torah?” He replied, “With the son of Amram.” He came to Moses, and said to him, “Where is the Torah?” “With the sea.” He came to the sea and asked it, “Where is the Torah?” “It is not in me. Go to the son of Amram.” He came to the son of Amram and said to him, “Where is the Torah?” “With the deep.” He came to the deep and asked, “Where is the Torah?” It replied, “It is not with me. Go to the son of Amram.” He came to the son of Amram and asked, “Where is the Torah?” “With the Holy One, blessed be He.” This is what the deep says, “It is not in me,” and the sea says, “It is not with me.”
@15
<b>Fine gold cannot be given</b> Heb. סְגוּר. This is synonymous with זהב סגוּר, lit. closed gold. This is fine gold, for when it is open, all gold establishments close.
@16
<b>It cannot be praised</b> Heb. תסלה, an expression of (Ps. 68:5), “Extol Him (סלו) Who rides in Aravoth.” He who praises it saying, “It is as esteemed as the gold of Ophir and as precious onyx,”—this is no praise for it. Similar to this is (Lam. 4:2), “praised (המסלאים) with fine gold.”
@17
<b>gold</b> Pure gold that shines like pearls.

@18
<b>Coral and crystal</b> They are names of precious stones in the sea.

@19
<b>The topaz of Kush</b> It is a precious stone, as in (Exod. 28:17), “ruby, topaz (פטדה).”
<b>with...jewelry</b> Heb. בכתם. That is a collection of jewelry for women’s adornments, and this collection is called כֶּתֶם in Hebrew, and “al halls” in Arabic. That is (Prov. 25:12) “Like a golden earring and jewelry of the finest gold (וחלי כתם),” and similarly (Hosea 2:15), “and adorned herself with her earrings and her jewelry (וחליתה).” Others interpret כֶּתֶם like כֶּתֶר, a crown, but it is incorrect because we do not find a verb with this root, as we find with כֶּתֶר. מַכְתִּיר, to crown or surround, כותרות capitals.
@21
<b>and from the winged creatures of the heavens</b> The angels who fly.
@22
<b>Destruction and death said</b> Those who destroy themselves and kill themselves over it said, “With our ears we heard its report that if one toils with it, it endures with him.” And others say as in the Aggadah that I explained above, that Satan came before the Omnipresent and asked Him, “Where is the Torah?” He said to him etc. That is what is written, “Destruction and death said, ‘With our ears we heard its report that it was given to Israel.’ But...”
@23
<b>God understood its way, and He knew its place</b> For He knows where it is situated, and they will also praise it and say of it that God understood its way; He looked at it and created the world with its letters in their order and according to their weight. He created all creatures as it is written in the secret of Sefer Yetzirah.
@24
<b>For He looks to the ends of the earth</b> how He should build them and create them, and under all the heavens He saw in it the needs of their creation.
@25
<b>To make</b> with it a weight for the wind, for each land according to its strength, and so the water according to its measure, according to what each land required to water it. There is an arid land which requires much rain, and there is a land that does not require so much.
@26

And so with the remaining orders He created everything with these letters. Everything is explained in the secret of Sefer Yetzirah.

<b>would come upon me</b> because I would sustain his children and his wife. Our Sages said, however, that he [Job] would rob the orphans of their field, improve it and [then] return it to them (Baba Bathra 16a). But the simple meaning of the verse does not appear to be so, for no one is called אובד, but a thing that is itself lost, like (Ps. 31:13), “like a lost vessel”; and so (ibid. 119:176), “I have gone astray like a lost sheep”, (Jer. 50:6), “lost sheep.”
<b>and I would make the widow’s heart sing for joy</b> for he would attach his name to widows, saying, “She is my kinswoman,” or “I will marry her,” in order that men should be anxious to marry her.
@14

@19
<b>My root will be open etc.</b> All this I was saying to myself, that my root would not dry up, and my branches would not die, like (above 14:9), “and it will produce a branch (קציר).” They are יונקות, tender branches of a tree. And I thought that my honor would be renewed.

<b>They listened to me and waited</b> Those who listened to my words would wait until they would be realized, and they would be realized because the tradition of wisdom was in my hand.
@22

<b>They pluck salt-wort on shrubs</b> When they were in the deserts, they would pluck for themselves salt-wort [that grew] on the trees of the forests and eat.
<b>salt-wort</b> Heb. מלוח. It is the name of an herb. In Aramaic (Pes. 114a), it is called קַקוּלִין and in the language of the Mishnah מַלוּחִים (malves in French), mallows, as we learned in (Kiddushin 66a): “They brought up mallows on golden tables.”

@13
<b>They break up my path</b> Heb. נתסוּ. [My] good [path] and do not care for it. נתסוּ is like נתצוּ the “sammech” replacing the “zaddi.”
<b>they serve to increase my calamity</b> they continue to provoke me.
@14
<b>As [through] a wide breach</b> in a fence, through which everyone comes and passes through, so they come together against me to embarrass me.

<b>my sinews</b> Heb. עֹרְקַי. My sinews have no rest. Sinew in Arabic is “orek.” So did Dunash explain it (Teshuvoth Dunash p.85). Another explanation: עֹרְקַי, my pursuers who cause me to flee. (Machbereth Menachem p. 139)
@18
<b>is my garment changed</b> My “garment” changes, layer after layer. When a person removes his garments and puts on other garments different from the first ones, he calls these בִּגְדֵי חֹפֶשׁ, like (I Kings 22:30), “I will disguise myself (התחפש) and go into battle.” This is translated into Aramaic by the word אשתני, I will change.

@19
<b>It directed me to the mud</b> These boils directed me and taught me to sit in the mud, as we said above (2:8). “and he sat down in the ashes.” Another explanation: הוֹרַנִי means: it cast me, an expression of (Exod. 15:4), “He cast (ירה) into the sea.”
<b>and I was compared</b> Was likened. And in the Midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma (Buber, Vayishlach 8): Said Rabbi Berechiah, “Transpose the verse.” I was compared to Abraham in my righteousness, who called himself dust and ashes (Gen.18:27), and He judges me like the wicked of the Generation of the Dispersion (who rebelled against Him by building the tower), concerning whom it is written (Gen. 11:3): “and the mortar served them as clay.”

<b>You cause me to ride [on it], and weakness melts me away</b> Weakness and feebleness of strength melted me away.

<b>if with His misfortune</b> If He would send a misfortune, which is a breach upon His creatures.
<b>He would dandle them</b> He would dandle them with partial consolations. And so did our Sages (Pesikta d’Rav Kahana p. 1 27a) explain it: The Holy One, blessed be He, does not smite a nation and leave it desolate, but He brings misfortune to one and dandles it with its fellow that suffered already, and it is consoled thereby. He brought misfortune upon Assyria and dandled it with Egypt, as it is said (Nahum 3:8): “Are you better than the great No- Amon?” He brought misfortune upon Egypt and dandled them with Assyria, as it is said (Ezek. 31: 3): “Behold Assyria was [a cedar] in the Lebanon.” The words להן שוע may also be interpreted as: Prayer and supplication avail them.

@12

When he speaks with an expression of uprooting, he says תְּשָרֵש, and to express roots, he also uses תְּשָרֵש. Similarly, יְשׁרָשוּ is an expression of uprooting and יְשׁרָשוּ is an expression of a root.

@24
<b>my hope</b> Heb. כסלי, like (8:14), “whose confidence (כסלו) shall be cut off.” My hope and my thought, and because the kidneys are on the flanks (כסלים), and the kidneys advise, the thought is called כֶּסֶל.
<b>and to jewelry</b> A gathering of gold and treasures.

(Another explanation:) This is what Job says, “Give it to inscribe me and my virtue.”

<b>noisome weeds</b> Heb. באשה, (a malodorous plant) like בְּאֻשִׁים (Isa. 5:2). And if I did not do so, may thistles emerge instead of wheat. (Rabbi Oshia taught: The Torah teaches you practical advice, that in a field beset with thistles it is advisable to sow wheat, and in a field beset with weeds, it is advisable to sow barley. This is the reading of Yalkut.) Now what is the reason? “Instead of wheat, thistles shall emerge.” Until this point, he repeatedly prophesies many prophecies, and you say: Job’s words are ended? Rather, Job says as follows, “If I have not done so, may Job’s words be ended, and may he have no pretext for saying before You (Deut. 26:13), ‘I have cleared away what is holy.’” I saw this in the Pesikta of the portion עשר תעשר (ibid. 14), explained in this manner from these verses.

This word [רֻטֲפַש] has no similarity in Scripture, and according to the context, we found it necessary to explain according to the meaning of the topic. But the one who interprets it as an expression of mire (רפש) and claims that the “teth” is added to it, as in (Gen. 44:16), “How can we clear ourselves (נצטדק)?” is in great error, because the “teth” is added to a word only in the reflexive voice, and to a word in which there is a radical “zaddi,” but nor in other words. for example, צדק and נצטדק, and like (Lev. 13:44) צרוּע, stricken with “zaraath,” and נצטרע, was stricken with “zaraath.” (Prov. 25: 13), “an emissary (ציר) faithful,” and (Josh. 9:4), “and they went and disguised as ambassadors (ויצטירו)”; (Gen. 45:21) “צֵדָה, provision,” and (Josh. 9:12) “הִצְטַיַדְנוּ, we took... for our provision.”

Menachem (Machbereth p. 11) associated it in this manner, and this is its interpretation: אָבִי יִבָּחֵן אִיוֹב עַד נֶצַח, my wish and my desire are that Job should be tried to eternity (omitted in some editions).

<b>with ropes of poverty</b> Heb. בחבלי cordes in French. It is only because they sinned before Him, and He comes to requite them for their own good, to cleanse them and to admonish them to return to Him.
@9
<b>He tells them their deed</b> With these sufferings, He lets them know that they sinned before Him.

@21
<b>Beware, do not turn to iniquity</b> to contend and to say, “He should have judged me with the sufferings of poverty.”
<b>for...this</b> These sufferings are to be chosen above poverty. A man to whom people behaved with respect and who has been accustomed to wealth all his life, will now stand and bargain, and having no money [to pay with], will be embarrassed and return home in disappointment. Now if you say that Job was a poor man in addition to his sufferings, we do not find that he lost anything except his livestock, but not silver or gold. And even if he lost his cattle with silver and gold, it is better for him to be a poor sick man than to be healthy and go in the marketplaces empty-handed [and be embarrassed as well]. In this manner, it is explained in the midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma (Mishpatim 11) from this verse, that Job’s sufferings are preferable to the sufferings of poverty, and so in the Aggadoth of the Talmud (Baba Bathra 116a).
@22

[In contrast,] when a mortal king wishes to wreak vengeance upon his enemies, he comes upon him suddenly, for, if he warns him, he will repent and be saved from him.

<b>For...therewith</b> With the clouds He judges peoples and chastises them by withholding rain, causing famine, as well as all sorts of plagues. When the Generation of the Flood sinned (Gen. 7:11), “and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.” As for the people of Sodom (Deut. 29:22), “Sulfur and salt, all the soil is burned up.” As for Sisera (Jud. 5:20), “From heaven they fought...against Sisera.”
<b>He gives food to one who has many</b> From there comes sustenance (Ex. 16:4): “See, I am about to have bread rain down from heaven for you.” This is to be compared to a baker who is standing before the oven. If an enemy comes in, he rakes coals and casts them at him; if his friend comes in, he takes out hot bread and gives it to him.
<b>to the one who has many</b> to the one whose children are many and numerous; to one who increases children and requires food.
@32
<b>Over the clouds</b> Heb. כפים, over the clouds. Similarly (Lam. 3:41), “Let us lift our heart to the clouds (כפים),” based on (I Kings 18:44), “...a cloud as small as a man’s palm (ככף).” But our Rabbis said (Taanith 7b): Because of the sin of (the robbery of) the hands.

Dig. to Hosea 7:16.] Our Sages, however, interpret it (Taanith 8a) as the acquisition of anger and wrath upon one who becomes haughty [after his prayers have been answered], but the vowelization, viz. that מִקְנֶה is vowelized with a “pattah” [meaning a “seggol”], does not substantiate [the theory] that it is connected to אַף, for were it connected to אַף, it would be vowelized with a “kamatz” [meaning a “tzeireh”], and it would not be punctuated by a cantillation sign that denotes a pause, viz. a revi’i.

<b>for their work</b> namely, of the rains; for the work which is incumbent upon them to do, either good or evil, he is turned about with many circuits, as [the passage] that we learned (Rosh Hashanah 17b): if Israel were perfectly righteous on Rosh Hashanah so that [much] rain was decreed for them, and they should later become sinful—it would be impossible to decrease it [the amount of rain] because the decree would already have gone forth; but the Holy One, blessed be He, would let it come down out of its season and upon a land that did not require it. “And sometimes to do good”; how is this? etc.
<b>whatever He commands them</b> Those rains, to do on earth. [Another explanation: And he turns around in circuits with His guidance—He causes the clouds and the winds to encompass the mountains so that they should be watered from all sides. In the Aggadah of “Vehayah ekev” (Sifrei Ekev 39).]
@13
<b>Whether for the rod</b> Whether for the punishment of men, He lets them fall on mountains and hills, which are not places for sowing.
<b>whether for His land</b> To let them fall as originally decreed, neither for the rod nor within the boundary of justice [i.e., for more benefit than strict justice warrants], but midway between [these two extremes].
<b>or for kindness</b> If the generation became more righteous than they were on Rosh Hashanah, then the rain which was decreed to fall in an average manner, shall be turned about by the guidance of their circuits to fall, with kindness, in their season and upon the land that requires them, so that not a drop of them should go to waste.

<b>or need a man tell</b> utter with his mouth.
<b>what is kept a secret</b> so that it should be revealed to Him immediately, like (II Sam. 17:16), “lest the king be told secretly (יבלע)” [lest] it be revealed. But our Sages (Meg. 18a) explained:

<b>And now, they did not see the rain</b> At the conclusion of his words, Elihu returns to chide Job’s three companions for not finding an answer. He therefore says, “And now, these three companions of yours, who should have answered you all these things that I said to you...”
<b>did not see the rain”</b> They are like stillborn babies, who did not see wisdom.
<b>it is [like] bright [clouds] in the skies</b> It is like many bright clouds that appear in the skies to bring down rain, but the wind comes and clears them away, makes them pass away, and no rain falls. That is their analogy; they began to answer you, but at the end, they remained silent and did not answer.
@22
<b>Gold[en splendor] comes from the north</b> It is as though he is returning to his previous statements. [“And now, they did not see the rain.”] Another explanation: The homily of the Sages (Taanith 7b) is that when the sky is full of spots, [i.e., full] of many clouds, to cause rain to fall, a wind passes and cleanses them away, and no rain falls. This is a homily of the Sages, but it does not fit the sequence of the verses.
<b>Gold comes from the north</b> The north wind blows and drives away the rain. Then the sun shines, like (Zech. 4:12), “that empty out the gold[en oil] from themselves.”
<b>on God</b> From before Him.
<b>(Gold comes from the north</b> The good gold is hidden for those who bring themselves to the commandments of the Holy One, blessed be He, and believe in the very awesome God.)
@23
<b>We have not found the Almighty great in power</b> to arouse His judgments upon the creatures with the greatness of His power, but with clemency. He makes atonements for the creatures with small things, according to their ability: a handful of [fine flour from] a meal offering, a half shekel, turtle doves and young pigeons, cattle and flocks; and He did not burden them to seek a wild ox or an antelope.
<b>and with judgment</b> Sufferings.
<b>He does not afflict</b> the creatures excessively. Likewise, He does nor afflict them to [force them into] becoming overly righteous to an impossible extent, but each man according to his ability.
@24
<b>Therefore, men fear Him</b> to debate with Him. (because)
<b>He does not look upon any wise of heart</b> who want to deal wisely with Him, because their wisdom is as nothing in His eyes. Our Sages (Rosh Hashanah 17a) explained this as referring to Job. Elihu says to him, “Because you would impose excessive fear upon your generation, you did not merit having wise-hearted sons remain alive to you.”

From the tempest with which you reproached Me (above 9:17), “He Who would crush me with a tempest,” I will answer you, as you will hear at the end of the chapter (verse 25), “Who has separated a place for the hair?” a shaft for every hair. Another explanation: With a tempest He afflicted him, and with a tempest He healed him, as is explained in Sifrei(?).
@2
<b>who gives dark counsel</b> Dark and foolish counsel. Another explanation: Who is this who gives dark counsel...without knowledge? Said the Holy One, blessed be He: Who is this who darkens counsel, frustrates words, i.e., with a multiplicity of words; for I wrote: “and that man was sincere and upright,” at the beginning of the Book, in order that My name should rest on Him, but he came and darkened and frustrated what I counseled with his many words. Whereupon Job replies to Him (below 42:3): “Who is this Who hides counsel?” Had I known Your counsel, I would not have spoken so much. Then the Holy One blessed be He, answers him, “Neither did Abraham know; yet he passed ten” [tests]. So I found.

<b>Who has separated a place for the hair</b> Heb. לטשף. In Arabia, a hair is called שִׁיטְפָא. To every hair on the head I have given תְעָלָה, a separate shaft from which to draw sap. If two would draw from the same shaft, a person’s eyesight would fail. These have not been changed by Me, how then should I change אִיוֹב, Job, for אוֹיֵב, enemy? And this is the meaning of מן הסערה, from the hair. Another explanation: לַשֶטֶף a streaming raindrop. I set apart for each drop a hole in the clouds, for if they were to come down [together] from one opening, they would soften the earth and turn it into a mire.
<b>and a way for the cloud of the thunderclaps</b> who parted? Every thunderclap has its own path, and if two of them would go along one path, the creatures would not be able to bear the sound.

@28
<b>waves of dew</b> Heb. אגלי, waves of גלי, dew, and the “aleph” is superfluous, as in (above 13: 17), “and to my speech (ואחותי) in your ears.” The “aleph” is superfluous at the beginning of the word because it is a noun, and similarly (Ezek. 21:20), “the scream of (אבחת) the sword,” like נבוח, barking, the scream of the sword. Another explanation: is like אַגְנֵי, basins of dew. A type of basins, divisions in which the dew is deposited. The “lammed” is interchangeable with a “nun,” and so in the Book of Ezra (Neh. 13:7), chamber (נִשְׁכָּה) like לִשְׁכָּה.

<b>Do you wait for the hinds to calve?</b> Heb. חלל, an expression of (Jer. 6:24), “pain (חיל) as of a woman in travail.” The hind’s womb is narrow, and the young cannot come forth; and, at the time of birth, I prepare a snake for her that bites her womb so that it opens; should it be a moment too early or too late, she would die immediately. I know to distinguish these moments, so should the distinction between Job (אִיוֹב) and enemy (אוֹיֵב) escape Me?

She is not afraid that he will tread on the eggs and crack them.] Every expression of הַמְרָאָה applies to a man whose heart prompts him to stray from his lifestyle, his upbringing, and his country, to roam in other countries and to try other lifestyles. Similarly (Deut. 21:18), “a stubborn and rebellious (וּמרֶה) son”; and in the language of the Talmud it is אִמְרָאִי: “Rav Zevid’s daughter-in-law rebelled (אִמְרָאִי) and went away” (Kethuboth 63b, Venice edition) (cf.

@30
<b>gulp down</b> Heb. יעלעו. Only according to the measure that one is able to swallow of blood or water, but it appears as if one swallows much, in imitation of the sound “al al.” Similarly, in the language of the Sages, concerning the suspected adulteress [who must] drink [the cursing water] (Sotah 20a), “they make her swallow (מערערין) and drink against her will.” [Here too, the sound “ar ar” is alluded to.] Similarly (Isa. 15:5), “a cry of destruction they shall raise (יעוערו),” the prophet using the onomatopoetic word in imitation of the sound produced by the throat.

<b>Who exposed the face of his raiment</b> He returns to the previous topic to speak of the leviathan: who can expose the scales, which are...
<b>within his double bridle</b> Into the fold of his lips, when they are open, who is it who will enter there? [The expression] בְּכֶפֶל, double, denotes the lips, which are double, one above and one below, into which no creature may enter because of fear of him.
@6
<b>the doors of his face</b> They are the lips when he closes his mouth; who can open them?
<b>Around his teeth is terror</b> That because of his fright and his terror, no creature can approach his teeth.
@7
<b>There is pride in his strong shields</b> He takes great pride in the strength of his shields; they are the scales that are on him, which protect him like a shield.
<b>closed</b> That is the seal of his coat of mail, which is narrow, closed, and strong, for each scale is attached to him and attached to the next one, so that no creature can strike him between the scales. This is what is stated: They are so close to each other, that all of them are brought together and are close to each other.
@9
<b>they stick together and cannot be separated</b> He is still repeating his language, that they [the scales] are stuck together and each one is joined to the next one so that they should not separate from each other.

<b>From his mouth go firebrands</b> Firebrands come forth from his mouth.
<b>sparks of fire</b> Like firebrands.
<b>go forth like foam</b> Heb. יתמלטו . Its interpretation is according to the context, escumicer in Old French [going forth like foam].
@12
<b>From his nostrils smoke goes forth</b> like a bubbling pot on the fire, which raises smoke.
<b>and an earthenware vessel</b> ואגמן. Its interpretation is according to its context: an expression of an earthenware vessel, like a bubbling pot; according to the matter that is stated (Jer. 1:13): “I see a bubbling pot.”
@13

@14
<b>Strength lodges in his neck</b> Mightiness.

@15
<b>The flakes of his flesh are joined together</b> Heb. דבקו. They adhere to each other closely, for the fish are composed of many pieces in its flesh, and they adhere to one another. In a large fish, which is cooked, the pieces are noticeable when they are lying one upon the other and one beside the other, and so is the sequence of the world: First he speaks of the scales of the leviathan and then of the flakes of his flesh and the strength of his heart.
<b>flakes</b> Heb. מפלי, an expression of folds of pieces. It is also possible to explain it as פְלָאֵי פלוּיֵי, [if it is split] in the language of the Talmud, an expression of the splits of his flakes.
<b>are joined together</b> the “beth” is vowelized by a small “kamatz” (tzeireh), like (Job 29:1O), “and their tongues stuck (דבקה) to their palates,” and many other cantillated by “ethrahta” or “sof pasuk.” [These are the pause accents.]
<b>poured out upon it</b> Heb. יצוק. Every flake poured out one upon the other, so that it should not move or separate one from the other. [The word] יָצוּק is an expression of being poured, and it is the passive participle, like יָרוּד, descended, from ירד ; יָצוּק, poured, from יצק ; יָדוּעַ, known, from ידע.
@16
<b>His heart is as strong as stone</b> His heart within him is as strong and basic as a permanent stone that is placed securely in the foundation of a building.
<b>and as strong as a lower millstone</b> This clause is repetitious, meaning that his heart is as basic and permanent as the millstone that is placed under the upper millstone, for the upper millstone revolves and rotates and grinds, whereas the lower one does not move from its place because it is fastened to its place, so that it should not move. That is called פֶּלַח [רֶכֶב] as it is stated (Jud. 9:53): “And a certain woman cast an upper millstone: פֶּלַח רֶכֶב, upon Abimelech’s head.” The lower one is called פֶלַח תַּחתִּית the lower piece.
@17
<b>From his fear the mighty are frightened</b> From his fear, the mighty and strong, both fishes and other creatures, are frightened.
<b>the breakers fail</b> The waves of the sea, which are called breakers, fail before him, because he breaks them with his swimming, as he swims and floats in the waves of the sea. [The word] יִתְחַטָּאוּ is an expression of a lack, like (I Kings 1:21), “and I and my son Solomon will be lacking (חַטָּאִים).”
@18
<b>He who overtakes him with a sword—it will not remain</b> A mighty man, who overtakes him to wage battle with a sword—his sword will not remain, because he will break it.
<b>[neither will] a spear, a slingshot, or a coat of mail</b> Likewise, none of these weapons that are in the hands of the overtaker will either remain or stand up before the leviathan. The word מַסָע may be said to be one type of weapon, like the sword, spear, and coat of mail(?). מַסָע may also be interpreted after the sample of (I Kings 6:7), “whole stones as they were transported (מַסָע) etc.,” and this is its interpretation: a transported spear, which is large and not so easily moved, because it is large and very strong; as the matter is stated concerning Goliath the Philistine (I Sam. 17:7), “And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the spear’s head was six hundred shekels, etc.”
<b>a coat of mail</b> Heb. ושריה, a coat of mail (שריון).
@19
<b>He regards iron as straw</b> Iron weapons are regarded by him as straw, and copper weapons are to him as rotten wood.
@20
<b>No arrow can put him to flight</b> He will not flee before an archer, and arrows and slingstones are as stubble to him.
@21

@22
<b>Under him are rays of the sun</b> in the place he rests, there are rays of the sun, because his fins, which are under him on his belly, illuminate and shine like the sun.
<b>rays</b> Heb. חדודי, like a sharp sword, which is sharpened, bright, and whitened. Because of this, he calls rays חַדוּדֵי.
<b>sun</b> Heb. חרשׂ, the sun, like (above 9:7), “He who spoke to the sun (לחרס) and it did not shine”; (Jud. 14:18); “before the sun (החרסה) set. “
<b>where he lies is gold upon the mire</b> This is a repeated clause. “Where he lies is gold,” refers to “rays of the sun”; “upon the mire” refers to “under him,” in the place where he is on the sand; this is the mire where he lies. It shines like precious gold, as it is stated (Song 3:10): “its couch of gold.” חָרוּץ is a type of gold, as it is stated (Prov. 8:19): “My fruit is better than gold (מחרוץ), yea than fine gold.” Where he lies—an expression of a couch for lying down, like (Song 3:10), “its couch (רפידתו) of gold.”
@23
<b>He makes the deep seethe like a pot</b> Like a small bubbling pot, that quickly raises bubbles one after another, so does he cause the deep, which is large and deep, to seethe.
<b>he makes the sea like a seething mixture</b> Like a mixture of a concoction of spices, which is compounded and mixed, so does he make and mix the sea when he moves from his place.
@24
<b>He makes a path shine after him</b> When he swims and floats in the sea, he makes the path of the deep shine, for at the time he swims, there is no water because of the speed of his swimming.
<b>he considers the deep to be hoary</b> To him, the deep is considered to be weak and feeble.
<b>to be hoary</b> The weakness of old age and hoariness.
@25
<b>On the dust there is none that rules over him</b> The “mem” [is vowelized] with a “hataf kamatz,” and it means his rule, that no creature rules over him, and it is a noun denoting a ruler. Therefore, the “mem” is vowelized with a “hataf kamatz.”
<b>which is made</b> Heb. העשו, like העשוי [the passive participle]. However, I know of no similar case [in Scripture]. It means one that was made without fear or dismay, that is not afraid of the creatures, as it is stated concerning the horse (above 39:22): “He scorns fear and is not dismayed.”
@26
<b>He looks at all high things</b> All the high things in the world he sees beneath himself, for so is the custom of the world, that whoever stands above sees the one below more than the one below sees [him]. Also, the one below has no power or victory against the one above. Now this leviathan sees all mighty men; that is to say, they have no power against him.
<b>he is king over all proud beasts</b> This is a repeated expression. He looks over all proud beasts and he is king over all the proud beasts, over all haughty creatures that I created in My world, who have no rule or dominion against him. Now how did you dare to lift your head before Me, since I perform all these wonders?

This verse is similar to (Gen. 11:6), “Now will nothing that they have planned to do be restrained (יבצר) from them?”

<b>because you did not speak</b> Because you did not speak to Me with a correct argument as did My servant Job, for he did not rebel against Me except for what he said (above 9:22), “He destroys both the innocent and the wicked,” and through the Adversary who denounces the world, as it is stated (ibid. verse 23): “If the scourge kills suddenly etc.” And if he continued to speak, he spoke because of the severity of the pains that burdened him and overwhelmed him; but you rebelled by condemning him, saying (4: 6), “Behold, your fear was your foolishness,” and you held him to be a wicked man, and at the end when you were silenced and defeated before him, you should have consoled him as Elihu did. Was it not enough for Job with his trouble and his sufferings, that you added rebellion to your sins to provoke him?
@8
<b>and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves</b> So that you placate and appease Me, provided that My servant Job pray for you that I forgive your sins, and no longer remember your transgressions.
<b>for I will favor him</b> Heb. כי אם, because I will favor him to accept his prayer (thus the word אִם is used for “that”), and likewise (Gen. 24:19), “until (עד אם) they have finished drinking”; (Ex. 21:30), “in which case (אם) an atonement is placed on him,” and many others.

~Song of Songs
#1
@1
<b>The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s</b> Our Rabbis taught (Shevu. 35b): Every Solomon (for they were at a loss to explain why Scripture did not mention his father, as it did in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes) mentioned in the Song of Songs is sacred (refers to God), the King to Whom peace (שָׁלוֹם) belongs. It is a song that is above all songs, which was recited to the Holy One, blessed be He, by His congregation and His people, the congregation of Israel. Rabbi Akiva said: The world was never as worthy as on the day that the Song of Songs was given to Israel, for all the Writings are holy, whereas the Song of Songs is the holiest of the holy. Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah said: To what can this be compared? To a king who took a se’ah of wheat and gave it to a baker. He said to him, “Extract for me so much fine flour, so much bran, so much coarse bran, and you shall produce enough fine flour for one white loaf, sifted and superior.” So are all the Writings holy and the Song of Songs the holiest of the holy, for it is all comprised of fear of Heaven and the acceptance of the yoke of His kingdom.
@2
<b>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth</b> She recites this song with her mouth, in her exile and in her widowhood: “If only King Solomon would kiss me with the kisses of his mouth as of old,” because in some places they kiss on the back of the hand or on the shoulder, but I desire and wish that he behave toward me as he behaved toward me originally, like a bridegroom with a bride, mouth to mouth.
<b>for...is better</b> your love [is better] to me more than any wine banquet and more than any pleasure and joy. In the Hebrew language, every banquet of pleasure and joy is called after the wine, as it is stated (Esther 7:8): “to the house of the wine feast”; (Isa. 24:9): “In song they shall not drink wine”; (ibid. 5:12): “And there were harp and lute, tambourine and flute, and wine at their drinking feasts.” This is the explanation of its apparent meaning. This figure of speech was used because He gave them His Torah and spoke to them face to face, and that love is still more pleasant to them than any pleasure, and they are assured by Him that He will appear to them to explain to them the secret of its reasons and its hidden mysteries, and they entreat Him to fulfill His word, and this is the meaning of “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.”
@3
<b>Because of the fragrance of your goodly oils</b> A good name is referred to by the expression, “good oil.”
<b>Because of the fragrance of your goodly oils</b> that those dwelling at the ends of the earth smelled, [i.e.,] those who heard of Your good fame when You performed awesome deeds in Egypt.
<b>your name is ‘oil poured forth.’</b> Your name is [thus] called. It is said about you that you are oil that is constantly being poured forth so that your fragrant scent wafts forth to a distance, for so is the nature of fragrant oil. As long as it is in a sealed bottle, its scent does not carry. If one opens it and pours the oil into another vessel, its scent carries.
<b>Therefore, the maidens loved you</b> Jethro came at the sound of the news and converted; also Rahab the harlot said, (Josh. 2:10f.): “For we have heard how the Lord dried up, etc.,” and thereby, “the Lord your God, He is God in heaven, etc.”
<b>maidens</b> virgins, since the text compares Him to a youth whose beloved holds him dear, and according to the allegory, the maidens are the nations.
@4
<b>Draw me, we will run after you</b> I heard from your messengers a hint that you said to draw me, and I said, “We will run after you to be your wife.”
<b>the king brought me to his chambers</b> And even this very day, I still have joy and happiness that I cleaved to you.
<b>We will recall your love</b> Even today, in living widowhood, I recall your early love more than any banquet of pleasure and joy.
<b>they have loved you sincerely</b> a strong love, a straightforward love, without crookedness (Heb. עקיבה) or deceit (Heb. רכסים), [after Isaiah 40:4: and the crooked terrain (הֶעָקֹב) shall become a plain and the rugged mountains (וְהָרְכָסִים) a valley], that my ancestors and I loved you in those days. This is its simple meaning according to its context, and according to its allegorical meaning, they mention before Him the loving kindness of [their] youth, the love of [their] nuptials, their following Him in the desert, a land of aridness and darkness, and they did not even prepare supplies for themselves, but they believed in Him and in His messenger, and they did not say, “How will we go out into the desert, which is not a land of seed or food,” but they followed Him, and He brought them into the midst of the chambers of the encompassment of His clouds. With this, they are still joyful today and happy in Him despite their afflictions and distress, and they delight in the Torah, and there they recall His love more than wine and the sincerity of their love for Him.
@5
<b>I am black but comely, etc.</b> You, my friends, let me not be light in your eyes even if my husband has left me because of my blackness, for I am black because of the sun’s gaze, but I am comely with the shape of beautiful limbs, and if I am black as the tents of Kedar, which are blackened by the rain, for they are constantly spread out in the deserts, I am easily cleansed to be like the curtains of Solomon. The allegory is that the congregation of Israel says to the nations: I am black in my deeds, but I am comely in the deeds of my ancestors, and even some of my deeds are comely. If I am guilty of the iniquity of the [Golden] Calf, I can counter it with the merit of the acceptance of the Torah (Song Rabbah). He calls the nations the daughters of Jerusalem because she [Jerusalem] is destined to become the metropolis for them all, as Ezekiel prophesied (16:61): “and I shall give them to you for daughters,” like (Josh. 15:45): “Ekron, with her towns (וּבְנוֹהֶיהָ).”
@6
<b>Do not look upon me</b> Do not look upon me disdainfully [like (I Sam. 6:19) “for they had gazed upon the Ark of the Lord”].
<b>because I am swarthy</b> For my blackness and my ugliness are not from my mother’s womb, but from tanning from the sun, for that blackness can easily be whitened by staying in the shade.
<b>my mother’s sons were incensed against me</b> These are the Egyptians among whom I grew up, and they went up with me in the mixed multitude; they were incensed against me with their enticement and their seduction until they made me...
<b>a keeper of the vineyards</b> and there the sun tanned me and I became blackened; i.e., they made me a worshipper of alien gods, but my own vineyard, which I had from my forefathers, I did not keep. We find that in the Scripture, leaders are called by an expression of vineyards, as it is said (Hos. 2:17): “And I will give to her her vineyards from there,” which the Targum renders: “And I will appoint her leaders for her.” And similarly (Job 24:18): “he will not turn by the way of the vineyards.”
@7
<b>Tell me, you whom my soul loves</b> The Divine Spirit repeatedly compares her to the flock that is beloved to the shepherd. The congregation of Israel says before Him as a woman to her husband, “Tell me, You Whom my soul loves, where do You feed Your flock among these wolves in whose midst they are, and where do You rest them at noon, in this exile, which is a distressful time for them, like noon, which is a distressful time for the flock?”
<b>for why should I be like one who veils herself</b> And if you ask, “What does it concern you?” It is not dignified for you that I should be like a mourner, with a veil over my lip, weeping for my flock.
<b>beside the flocks of your companions</b> beside the flocks of the other shepherds, who pasture flocks as you do; i.e., among the flocks of the heathens, who rely on pagan deities, and who have kings and princes who lead them.
@8
<b>If you do not, etc.</b> This is the shepherd’s reply: If you do not know where you should go to feed your flock, you, O fairest of women, for the shepherd has ceased pasturing them.
<b>go your way in the footsteps of the flocks</b> Look at the footsteps, the way that the flocks went, and the heels are discernible, traces in French, tracks. There are many similar instances in Scripture, e.g. (Ps. 77: 20): “and Your steps (וְעִקְבוֹתֶיךָ) were not known”; (Jer. 13:22): “your steps (עֲקֵבָיִךְ) were cut off”; (Gen. 49:19): “and his troops will return in their tracks (עָקֵב).” He will return in his tracks; now go that way.
<b>and pasture your kids beside the shepherds’ dwellings</b> among the dwellings of the other shepherds beside whom you are, and this is the allegory: If you do not know, My assembly and My congregation, O fairest of women, [the fairest] of the nations, where you will pasture and be saved from the hand of those who oppress you, to be among them, and that your children should not perish, ponder the ways of your early ancestors, who received My Torah and kept My watch and My commandments, and go in their ways, and as a reward for this, you will pasture your kids beside the princes of the nations, and so did Jeremiah say (31:20): “Set up markers for yourself...put your heart to the highway, etc.”
@9
<b>At the gathering of the steeds of Pharaoh’s chariots have I silenced you, my beloved</b> Heb. לְסֻסָתִי . This “lammed” is like the “lammed” of (Jer. 10:13): “At the sound of (לְקוֹל) His giving a multitude of waters,” and like (above verse 3): “At the fragrance of (לְרֵיחַ) your oils.” At the gathering of many stee ds, for I gathered my camps to go forth toward you in the chariots of Pharaoh to save you, as it is said (Hab. 3:15): “You trampled in the sea with your steeds,” many steeds. There I silenced you, my beloved. I silenced you from your cry, as it is written (Exod. 14:14): “and you shall be silent.” I saw this in Aggadic works (Song Rabbah). Another explanation: דִמִיתִךְ רַעְיָתִי—There I demonstrated to all that you are my beloved.
<b>steeds</b> Heb. לְסֻסָתִי, means a gathering of horses, and in the French language, chevalchie, troop of horses, cavalcade. דִמִיתִךְ is adesmay in Old French, like (Jud. 20:5): “Me they intended (דִמוּ) to kill,” for there I adorned you with beautiful ornaments.
@10
<b>Your cheeks are comely with rows</b> rows of earrings and a golden forehead plate.
<b>your neck with necklaces</b> necklaces of gold with pearls strung on golden threads of the plunder of the sea.
@11
<b>We will make you rows of gold</b> I and My tribunal decided before the arrival of Pharaoh that I should entice him and strengthen his heart to pursue you with all the best of his hidden treasures, so that we should make rows of golden ornaments for you.
<b>with studs of silver</b> that were already in your possession, that you took out of Egypt, for the plunder at the sea was greater than the plunder in Egypt.
<b>studs</b> silver objects studded and decorated with stripes and hues.
@12
<b>While the king was still at his table</b> The congregation of Israel replies and says, “All this is true. You bestowed good upon me, but I repaid You with evil, for while the king was still at the table of his wedding banquet...”
<b>my spikenard gave forth its fragrance</b> This is instead of saying, “gave forth its stench.” When the Shechinah was still at Sinai, I sinned with the Calf; Scripture describes it with an expression of love, “gave forth its fragrance,” and did not write, “stank,” or “became putrid,” because Scripture speaks euphemistically. [Rashi from Shab. 88b] (According to the Tosafists, it does not say, “stank,” because of euphemism, and it does not say, “abandoned its fragrance,” because of love.)
@13
<b>A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me</b> My beloved has become to me as one who has a bundle of myrrh in his bosom, and he said to him, “Here, take this bundle, which will give a more fragrant scent than the first one that you lost.” So was the Holy One, blessed be He, appeased by Israel for the incident of the Calf and found them an atonement for their iniquity and said: Donate to the Tabernacle, and let the gold of the Tabernacle atone for the gold of the Calf.
<b>between my breasts he shall lie</b> Even though I betrayed him, he said to dwell there.
<b>between my breasts</b> between the two staves of the Ark.
@14
<b>A cluster of henna-flowers</b> Heb. כֹּפֶר. There is a spice called כֹּפֶר, like (below 4:12): “Henna- flowers (כְּפָרִים) with spikenard,” and it is shaped like a sort of cluster.
<b>in the vineyards of Ein-Gedi</b> The name of a place, and there it is common. I saw in an aggadah (Song Zuta) that those vineyards produce fruits four or five times a year, and this is symbolic of the many atonements and forgivenesses that the Holy One, blessed be He, forgave them for the many trials that they tried Him in the desert.
@15
<b>Behold, you are comely, my beloved</b> I was ashamed of my sin, but He encouraged me with appeasing words, saying, (Num. 14:20): “I have forgiven according to your words,” and you are most fair, for your eyes are like doves; i.e., a bride whose eyes are ugly—her entire body requires examination but [a bride] whose eyes are beautiful, her body requires no examination. (Song Rabbah 4). The allegorical meaning is: I forgave you for your iniquity, and behold you are fair with [your statement of] “Let us do,” and you are fair with [your statement of] “Let us hear”; fair with the deeds of your forefathers and fair with your own deeds, because...
<b>your eyes are like doves</b> There are righteous among you who clung to Me like a dove, which, as soon as it recognizes its mate, does not abandon it to mate with another. Similarly, (Exod. 32:26): “and all the sons of Levi gathered to him,” and they did not err with the Calf, and moreover, behold you are fair with the work of the Tabernacle, as it is said (ibid. 39:43): “and behold, they made it, etc. and Moses blessed them”; behold he praised them for that.
@16
<b>Behold, you are comely, my beloved, yea pleasant</b> The beauty is not mine, but yours; you are the comely one.
<b>yea pleasant</b> For You overlooked my transgression and caused Your Shechinah to rest in our midst, and this is the praise of the descent of the fire (Lev. 9:24): “and all the people saw and shouted for joy.”
<b>also our couch is leafy</b> Through your pleasantness, behold our couch is leafy with our sons and with our daughters, all of whom gather to You here, as it is said (ibid. 8:4): “and the congregation gathered [to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting].” The Tabernacle is called a bed, as it is said (below 3:7): “Behold, the litter of Solomon,” and the Temple is called a bed, as it is said concerning Joash (II Chron. 22:11, II Kings 11:2): “in the bed chamber” which was in the “House of the Lord” (ibid. 3), because they [the Sanctuaries] are the source of Israel’s fruitfulness and procreation.
@17
<b>The beams of our houses are cedars</b> This is the praise of the Tabernacle.

<b>a rose</b> Heb. חֲבַצֶלֶת. This is a rose (שּׁוֹשַׁנָה).
<b>a rose of the valleys</b> This is prettier than the rose of the mountains because it is always moist, since the sun has no strength there.
@2
<b>As a rose among the thorns</b> which pierce it, but it remains constant in its beauty and its redness, so is my beloved among the daughters. They entice her to pursue them to stray like them after strange gods, but she remains firm in her faith.
@3
<b>As an apple tree among the trees of the forest</b> When an apple tree is among trees that do not bear fruit, it is more beloved than them all, for its fruit is good in both taste and fragrance.
<b>so is my beloved among the sons</b> among the young men. The allegory is that so is the Holy One, blessed be He, chosen above all the gods. Therefore, in His shade I delighted and sat. The Midrash Aggadah (Song Rabbah), [states]: This apple tree—all flee from it because it has no shade. So did all the nations flee from the Holy One, blessed be He, at the giving of the Torah, but I in His shade I delighted and sat.

<b>He brought me to the banquet hall</b> The Tent of Meeting, where the details and the explanations of the Torah were given.
<b>and his attraction to me [was symbolic of his] love</b> And his gathering, that he gathered me to him, that was love to me. I still remember his love. וְדִגְלוֹ is attrait in French.
@5
<b>Sustain me</b> now as is the manner of the sick, with flagons of grape wine or with cakes of pure white flour.
<b>spread my bed</b> Spread my bed around me with apples for a good fragrance, in the manner of the sick, for I am sick for his love, for I thirst for Him here in my exile. רְפִידָה is an expression of a couch, like (Job 41:22): “where he lies (יִרְפַּד) is gold upon the mire.”
@6
<b>His left hand was under my head</b> in the desert.
<b>and his right hand would embrace me</b> He traveled a three-days’ journey; to search out a rest for them [as in Num. 10:33], and in the place of the rest, He brought down manna and quails for them. All this I remember now in my exile, and I am sick for His love.

<b>I adjure you</b> you nations.
<b>by the gazelles or by the hinds</b> that you will be abandoned and preyed upon like gazelles and hinds.
<b>that you neither awaken nor arouse the love</b> that is between my beloved and I, to change it and to alter it and beg me to be enticed to follow you.
<b>while it is desirous</b> as long as it is thrust in my heart, and he desires me.
<b>while it is desirous</b> Heb. עַד, like (1:12): “While (עַד) the king was at his table,” [i.e.,] while (בְּעוֹד) the king was still at his table.
<b>that you neither awaken</b> Heb. תָּעִירוּ, if you cause hatred, like (I Sam. 28:16): “and has become your adversary (עָרֶךָ)”; (Dan. 4:16): “and its interpretation for Your foes (לְעָרָךְ).”
<b>nor contest</b> Heb. תְּעוֹרְרוּ, like (Keth. 13: 6): “one who contests the ownership (הָעוֹרֵר) of a field,” chalon[j]טr in Old French, to contest, claim. There are many aggadic midrashim but they do not fit the sequence of the topics, for I see that Solomon prophesied and spoke about the Exodus from Egypt and about the giving of the Torah, the Tabernacle, the entry to the Land, the Temple, the Babylonian exile, and the coming of the Second Temple and its destruction.
@8
<b>The sound of my beloved</b> The poet returns to earlier topics, like a person who was brief with his words and later said, “I did not tell you the beginning of the matter.” He commenced by saying, “The king brought me into his chambers,” but did not tell how He remembered them in Egypt with an expression of affection, and now he returns and states: This attraction that I told you about, that my beloved drew me and I ran after him, came about as follows: I had despaired of the redemption until the completion of the four hundred years that were foretold [in the Covenant] between the Segments.
<b>The sound of my beloved! Behold, he is coming</b> before the end, as one skipping over the mountains and jumping over the hills.
@9
<b>My beloved resembles a gazelle</b> in the swiftness of his running, for he hastened to come like a gazelle and like a fawn of the hinds. עֹפֶר is a young hind.

@10
<b>raised his voice</b> Heb. עָנָה, an expression of answering and [sometimes] an expression of a loud cry, and the following is the precedent for them all (Deut. 27:14): “And the Levites shall raise their voices (וְעָנוּ).”
<b>and said to me</b> through Moses.
<b>Arise</b> (Exod. 3:17): “I will bring you up from the affliction of Egypt.”

<b>the time of singing has arrived</b> when the birds give forth their song, and the sound is pleasant for travelers.
<b>and the voice of the turtledove</b> Heb. הַתּוֹר. According to its apparent meaning, this is a term referring to turtledoves and young pigeons. It is customary for the birds to sing and chirp in the days of Nissan.
@13
<b>The fig tree has put forth its green figs</b> [This is to be explained] according to its apparent meaning.
<b>and the vines with their tiny grapes</b> When the blossom falls, and the grapes are separated from one another, and each grape is recognizable by itself, it is called סְמָדַר. This entire episode, according to its simple meaning, is an expression of the affection of enticement, i.e., a young man appealing to his betrothed to follow him. So did my beloved do to me.
<b>[10] My beloved raised his voice</b> through Moses.
<b>and said to me</b> through Aaron.
<b>Arise, my beloved</b> Hurry (Exod. 11:2): “and let each man borrow from his neighbor.”
<b>[11] For behold, the winter has passed</b> These are the four hundred years. I skipped them by counting them from Isaac’s birth.
<b>the rain</b> which is the hardship of winter, is over and has gone away; i.e., eighty-six years of harsh slavery were decreed upon you, and they have gone away. From the time that Miriam was born, the Egyptians intensified the bondage upon Israel; therefore, she was called Miriam, because they made it bitter (מַר) for them.
<b>[12] The blossoms have appeared in the land</b> Behold Moses and Aaron are prepared for you to fulfill all your needs.
<b>the time of singing has arrived</b> you are destined to recite the Song by the Sea.
<b>and the voice of the turtledove</b> Heb. הַתּוֹר, the great guide (תַּיָר). Another explanation: קוֹל הַתּוֹר means the voice [announcing] that the time of your exodus from Egypt has arrived. [תּוֹר is explained to mean time, as in Esther (2:12,15).]
<b>[13] The fig tree put forth its green figs</b> The time to bring the first fruits has arrived, for you will enter the Land.
<b>and the vines with their tiny grapes</b> The time of the wine libations has drawn near. Another explanation: The pious among you ripened and blossomed good deeds before Me and emitted a pleasant scent.
<b>arise</b> Heb. קוּמִי לָכִי. A superfluous “yud” is written. Arise to receive the Ten Commandments. Another explanation: “The fig tree has put forth its green figs”—These are the transgressors of Israel, who perished during the three days of darkness.
<b>and the vines with their tiny grapes gave forth their fragrance</b> Those who remained of them repented and were accepted. So it is interpreted in Pesikta (Rabbathi 15:11, 12; Pesikta d’Rav Kahana, p. 50).
@14
<b>My dove, in the clefts of the rock</b> This is said concerning that time when Pharaoh pursued them and overtook them camping by the sea with no avenue of escape before them because of the sea, and they could not turn because of the wild beasts. What did they resemble at that time? A dove that fled from a hawk and entered the clefts of the rocks, and a snake was hissing at her. Should she enter within, there was the snake. Should she go outside, there was the hawk. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her, “Show Me your appearance,” the propriety of your deeds, to whom you turn in time of trouble.
<b>let me hear your voice</b> (Exod. 14:10): “And the Children of Israel cried out to the Lord.”
<b>in the clefts of</b> Heb. בְּחַגְוֵי, in the clefts; this is a term referring to a breach, and similar to this is (Ps. 107:27): “They were frightened (יָחוֹגוּ) and staggered”; (Isa. 19:17): “And the land of Judah will be to Egypt for a dread (לְחָגָא),” and in the plural Scripture calls them חַגְוֵי. Similarly, from קֵץ (end) קַצְוֵי, and so, (II Sam. 10:4): “and he cut off their garments (מַדְוֵיהֶם).”
<b>steps</b> Heb. מַדְרֵיגָה, יchelons, in French, steps. When they make a ditch around the towers and pour the earth from above to raise the mound roundabout, they make it [in] many steps, one above the other.
<b>in the coverture of the steps</b> There are sometimes holes in them, and reptiles and birds enter therein.
@15
<b>Seize for us the foxes</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, heard their voice, commanded the sea, and it inundated them. That is the meaning of “Seize for us” these “foxes,” the little ones with the big ones, for even the little ones were destroying the vineyards, when our vineyards were still with סְמָדַר, when the grapes were tiny. When a Jewish woman gave birth to a male and hid him, the Egyptians entered their houses and searched for the males, but the baby was concealed, and he was a year or two old. So they would bring a baby from an Egyptian home; the Egyptian baby would speak, and the Jewish baby would answer him from his hiding place; and they would seize him and cast him into the Nile. Now why does he call them foxes? Just as the fox looks to turn around to flee, so did the Egyptians look behind them, as it is written (Exod. 14:25): “I shall flee from before Israel.”
<b>little foxes</b> Heb. שֻּׁעָלִים. It is written without a “vav”, because He punished them with water, which was measured with the gait (בְּשָּׁעֳלוֹ) of the Omnipresent.
@16
<b>My beloved is mine, and I am his</b> He demanded all His needs from me; He commanded only me: Make a Passover sacrifice, hallow the firstborn, make a Tabernacle, sacrifice burnt offerings, and He did not demand these things of any other nation.

<b>who grazes</b> his flock among the roses, in a good, pleasant, and beautiful pasture.
@17
<b>Until the sun spreads</b> This refers back to the preceding verse: “My beloved is mine, and I am his,” until the time that the iniquity caused the sun to darken me in the heat of the day, and the heat to intensify.
<b>and the shadows flee</b> We sinned with the Calf; we sinned with the Spies, and the shadows fled, the merits that protected us. We broke off His yoke.

@9
<b>King Solomon made himself a palanquin</b> This refers to the Tent of Meeting, which was established in the Tabernacle at Shiloh. He made Himself a crowning canopy for glory.
@10
<b>its couch of gold</b> His couch and His dwelling were on the Ark cover, which is gold.
<b>its curtain of purple</b> Heb. מֶרְכָּבוֹ. This is the dividing curtain, which hangs and “rides” (רוֹכֵב) on poles from pillar to pillar.
<b>its interior inlaid</b> arranged with a floor of love—the Ark with an Ark cover, cherubim, and Tablets.
<b>from the daughters of Jerusalem</b> Heb. יְרוּשָּׁלָיִם. These are the Israelites, who fear (יְרֵאִים) and are wholehearted (שְּׁלֵמִים) with the Holy One, blessed be He.

<b>0 daughters of Zion</b> Heb. צִיוֹן. [This refers to] the sons, who are distinguished (מְצֻיָנִין) for Him with circumcision, phylacteries, and ritual fringes.
<b>upon the crown with which his mother crowned him</b> [This refers to] the Tent of Meeting, which is crowned with hues: blue, purple, and crimson. Rabbi Nehunia said: Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai asked Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Jose, “Perhaps you heard from your father what the meaning of ‘upon the crown with which his mother crowned him’ is?” He replied: “This is a parable of a king who had an only daughter of whom he was very fond. He could not stop loving her until he called her “my daughter,” as it is said (Ps. 45:11): “Hearken, daughter, and see.” He could not stop loving her until he called her “my sister,” as it is said (below 5: 2): “Open for me, my sister, my beloved.” He could not stop loving her until he called her “my mother,” as it is said (Isa. 51:4): “Hearken to Me, My people, and My nation (וּלְאוּמִי), bend your ears.” It is written: וּלְאֻמִי [which can be read as וּלְאִמִי, and to my mother]. Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai stood up and kissed him on his head, etc.
<b>on the day of his nuptials</b> the day of the giving of the Torah, when they crowned Him King for themselves and accepted His yoke.
<b>and on the day of the joy of his heart</b> This refers to the eighth day of the inauguration, when the Tabernacle in the desert was dedicated.

<b>Behold, you are fair, my beloved</b> He praised them and appeased them, and their sacrifices pleased Him.
<b>until the sun spreads</b> that they sinned before Me in the days of Hophni and Phinehas.
<b>your eyes are [like] doves</b> Your hues and your appearance and your characteristics are like those of a dove, which cleaves to its mate, and when they slaughter it, it does not struggle but stretches forth its neck; so have you offered your shoulder to bear My yoke and My fear.
<b>from within your kerchief; your hair is like a flock of goats</b> This praise is a paradigm of the praise of a woman beloved by her bridegroom. Within your kerchief, your hair is beautiful and glistens with brilliance and whiteness like the hair of white goats descending from the mountains, whose hair gleams in the distance. And in the allegorical sense, [it is said of] the congregation of Israel that within your camps and your tents, even the empty ones among you are as dear to Me as Jacob and his sons, who streamed down to descend from Mount Gilead when Laban overtook them there. Another explanation: As those who mobilized against Midian beyond the Jordan, which is in the land of Gilead, and this language is found in Midrash Shir Hashirim.
<b>within</b> Heb. מִבַּעַד. This is a term meaning “within,” for the majority of בְּעַד in Scripture refers to something that covers and shields against something else, like (Job 9:7): “and He sealed up (וּבְעַד) the stars”; (Jonah 2:7): “the earth—its bars are closed on me (בְּעַדִי)”; (Job 22: 13): “Does He judge through (הַבְעַד) the dark cloud?” And מִבַּעַד is the thing that is within that בְּעַד. Therefore, he says, מִבַּעַד.
<b>your kerchief</b> Heb. צַמָּתֵךְ. An expression denoting a thing that confines the hair so that it does not show, and this refers to a kerchief and ribbons. It is impossible to interpret צַמָּתֵךְ as meaning a veil (צֹמֶת), where the “tav” is a radical, for were that so, it would have to be punctuated with a “dagesh” when immediately preceding a “hey,” which makes it the feminine possessive, or a “vav,” which makes it the masculine possessive, like the “tav” of שַּׁבָּת, which, when given to a female, (i.e., in the feminine possessive form), is punctuated with a “dagesh,” like (Hos. 2: 13): “her festival[s], her new moon[s], and her Sabbath[s] (שַּׁבַּתָּהּ),” and so for the masculine, (Num. 28:10): “the burnt offering of a Sabbath in its Sabbath (בְּשַּׁבַּתּוֹ),” but the “tav” of צַמָּתֵךְ, which is not punctuated with a “dagesh,” perforce comes instead of a “hey,” and the name of the kerchief is צַמָה, and when it is possessive, to be given to a male or female, the “hey” is converted to a “tav” without a “dagesh”; e.g. שִּׁפְחָה becomes שִּׁפְחָתוֹ or שִּׁפְחָתָה, and so אָמָה [becomes] אֶמָתוֹ, אֲמָתָה ; עֶרְוָה (nakedness) [becomes] עֶרְוָתוֹ, עֶרְוָתָה, and likewise, this one, צָמָה [becomes] צַמָתוֹ, צַמָתָה, צַמָּתִי, צַמָתֵךְ.
<b>that streamed</b> Heb. שֶׁגָלְשׁוּ, that they became bald. גִבֵּחַ is rendered by the Targum as גְלוֹשּׁ. When the animals descend from the mountain, the mountain becomes bald and bare of them.
@2
<b>Your teeth are like a flock of uniformly shaped [ewes]</b> This praise too is in terms of a woman’s beauty.
<b>Your teeth</b> are thin and white and arranged like wool and the order of a flock of ewes, selected from the rest of the flocks by count and number, delivered to a clever and worthy shepherd to be careful with their wool, for they make them into fine woolen garments, and they watch them from the time of their birth, that the wool should not become soiled, and they wash them from day to day.
<b>all of whom are perfect</b> Heb. מַתְאִימוֹת, an expression of perfection, (Ps. 38:4): “There is no soundness (מְתֹם),” i.e., perfect, enterins in Old French, whole, perfect, sound.
<b>bereavement</b> There is neither bereavement nor blemish among them. This example is given as symbolic of the mighty men of Israel, who cut down and devour their enemies surrounding them with their teeth, and yet they distance themselves from stealing from Israelites and from immoral acts, so that they should not become sullied with sin. Now this praise was given concerning the twelve thousand men who mobilized against Midian with count and number, of whom not one was suspected of committing immoral acts, as it is written (Num. 31:49): “and not a single man among us is missing.” And they even brought atonements for erotic thoughts, and they were not suspected of theft, for Scripture attests for them, (ibid. verses 11f.): “And they took all the booty and they brought it to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, etc.,” and not one of them concealed even one cow or one donkey.
@3
<b>Your lips are like a scarlet thread</b> beautiful to promise and to keep their promise, as the Spies did to Rahab the harlot, i.e., they said to her, (Josh. 2:18): “you shall bind this line of scarlet thread, etc.,” and they kept their promise.
<b>and your speech</b> Heb. וּמִדְבָּרֵךְ your speech, and this is of the structure of (Ezek. 33:30): “who talk (הַנִדְבָּרִים) about you beside the walls”; (Mal. 3:16): “Then the God-fearing men spoke (נִדְבְּרוּ),” parlediz in Old French; words, speech, talk.
<b>your temple</b> Heb. רַקָתֵךְ. This is the highest part of the face, called pomels or pomials, cheek-bones, [some editions read: tenples or tanples, temples] next to the eyes. And in the language of the Talmud, it is called “the pomegranate of the face,” and it resembles the split half of a pomegranate from the outside, which is red and round. This is a praise in terms of a woman’s beauty, and our Sages explained the allegory to mean: even your worthless ones (רֵיקָנִים, lit. empty ones) are full of mitzvoth as a pomegranate.
<b>from within your kerchief</b> Heb. מִבַּעַד לְצַמָתֵך, from within your kerchief.
@4
<b>Your neck is like the Tower of David</b> An erect stature is beauty in a woman, and the allegorical meaning is that [just as] the Tower of David, which is the Citadel of Zion, is a place of strength, a tower, and a fortress, so is your neck. This is the Chamber of Hewn Stone, which was Israel’s strength and fortification, and that tower was built as a model, and was built for beauty, so that everyone should look at it to learn its forms and the beauty of its architecture, and the word (לְתַלְפִּיּוֹת) is of the grammatical structure of (Job 35:11): “He teaches us (מַלְפֵנוּ) more than the beasts of the earth,” and the “tav” in תַלְפִּיוֹת is like the “tav” in תַרְמִית (guile) and תַבְנִית (form).
<b>a thousand shields hanging on it</b> It was the custom of the princes to hang their shields and their quivers on the walls of the towers.
<b>quivers</b> Heb. שִּׁלְטֵי, the quivers in which they place arrows, like (Jer. 51:11): “Polish the arrows, fill the quivers (הַשְּׁלָטִים),” and similar to this is the Chamber of Hewn Stone, whence instruction goes forth, for the Torah is a shield to Israel, (rendering אֶלֶף הַמָּגֵן as: the teaching that is a shield). It is also possible to render אֶלֶף הַמָּגֵן as מָגֵן הָאֶלֶף, the shield of the thousand, alluding to (I Chron. 16:15): “the word He had commanded to the thousandth [לְאֶלֶף] generation.”
<b>all the quivers of the mighty men</b> We find that disciples are symbolized by arrows and quivers, as is stated (Ps. 127:4f.): “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of one’s youth. Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with them.”
@5
<b>Your two breasts</b> which nourish you. This refers to Moses and Aaron
<b>are like two fawns, the twins of a gazelle</b> It is customary for a gazelle to bear twins so that they are both identical, this one to that one. Another explanation:
<b>Your two breasts</b> symbolize the Tablets.
<b>the twins of a gazelle</b> exactly corresponding in one measure; the five commandments on this one (side of the Tablets, correspond to) the five commandments on the other (side of the Tablets), each commandment corresponding to a commandment. “I [am the Lord your God]” corresponds to “You shall not murder,” for the murderer diminishes the semblance of the Holy One, blessed be He. “You shall not have [any other gods before Me]” corresponds to “You shall not commit adultery,” for one who commits idolatry is like an adulterous woman, who takes strangers instead of her husband. “You shall not hear [the name of the Lord your God in vain]” corresponds to “You shall not steal,” for one who steals will ultimately swear falsely. “Remember [the Sabbath day to keep it holy]” corresponds to “You shall not bear [false witness against your neighbor],” for one who profanes the Sabbath testifies falsely against his Creator, saying that He did not rest on the Sabbath of Creation. “Honor [your father and mother]” corresponds to “You shall not covet,” for one who covets is destined to beget a son who slights him and honors one who is not his father.

<b>and the shadows flee</b> That is the time of heat, the hottest time of the day. I will save you, and you are pleasant to me.
<b>the sun</b> Heb. הַיוֹם, usually “the day.” This refers to the sun, and likewise, (Gen. 3: 8): “in the direction of the sun (לְרוּחַ הַיוֹם), and so, (Mal. 3:19): “For lo, the sun (הַיוֹם) comes, glowing like a furnace,” and when the sun spreads, I will go to Mount Moriah, to the everlasting Temple. [This is] in Genesis Rabbah (55:7). i.e., When they will then sin before Me by profaning My sacred offerings and by spurning My meal offerings in the days of Hophni and Phinehas (I Sam. 3:12-17), I will withdraw from them and I will abandon this Tabernacle, and I will choose for Myself Mount Moriah, the everlasting Temple, and there, “You are all fair...and there is no blemish in you,” and there I will accept all your sacrifices.

<b>With me from Lebanon, my bride</b> When you will be exiled from this Lebanon, with Me you will be exiled, for I will go into exile with you.
<b>with me from Lebanon shall you come</b> And when you return from the exile, I will return with you, and also all the days of the exile, I will be distressed with your distress. Therefore, he writes: “with Me from Lebanon you shall come.” When you are exiled from this Lebanon, you shall come with Me, and he does not write: “with Me to Lebanon you shall come,” denoting that from the time of your departure from here until the time of your arrival here, I am with you wherever you go out and come in.
<b>you shall look from the peak of Amanah</b> When I gather your dispersed ones, you will look and ponder what is the reward of your actions from the beginning of your faith (אֶמוּנָה) that you believed in Me (Tan. Beshallach 10), your following Me in the desert and your travels and your encampments by My command, and your coming to the peak of Senir and Hermon, which were the dens of lions, namely Sihon and Og (Song Rabbah, Mid. Zuta). Another explanation: From the peak of Amanah. This is a mountain on the northern boundary of the Land of Israel, named Amanah, and in the language of the Mishnah, the mountains of Amnon, and [this is] Mount Hor, about which it says: (Num. 34:6): “from the Great Sea you shall draw a line extending to Mount Hor.” When the exiles gather and arrive there, they will look from there and see the boundary of the Land of Israel and the air of Israel, and they will rejoice and utter thanks. Therefore, it says: “You shall see from the peak of Amanah.”

And so, בְּאַחַד עֲנָק מְצַוְרֹנָיךְ, with one of the links of the necklaces of your adornments; these are the adornments of the commandments with which the Israelites are distinguished. Another explanation: בְּאַחַד עֲנָק—with one of your forefathers; he was the one who was special, and that is Abraham, who was called עֲנָק, a giant, “the greatest man among the Anakim” (Josh. 14:15).

<b>A locked up garden</b> This refers to the modesty of the daughters of Israel, who are not loose in immoral actions.
<b>a locked up spring</b> Heb. גַל. This may be explained as a term referring to a fountain, like (Josh. 15:19): “upper springs (גֻלֹת עִלִיּוֹת),” and it may also be explained as a term referring to a gate. This is an Aramaic expression; in the Talmud (Ber. 28a): טְרוּקוּ גַלֵי, lock the gates.

<b>Your arid fields</b> Dry land is called בֵּית הַשְּׁלָחִין. It must be continually irrigated, and a field watered by rain is superior to it. Here he praises the arid field. Your arid fields are replete with all good like a pomegranate orchard. This is symbolic of the smallest of Israel, who are moist with good deeds like a pomegranate orchard.

<b>A garden fountain</b> All this refers back to, “your arid fields” and he praises them (comparing them to) a fountain that waters them, and this figure of speech symbolizes the immersions of purity which the daughters of Israel immerse themselves.

<b>Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind</b> Since your fragrance and the beauty of your dwellings is pleasing to me, I command the north and south winds to blow on your garden so that your good fragrance should spread afar. And this figure of speech symbolizes the ingathering of the exiles and from all the nations they will bring [them] as an offering to Jerusalem, and in the days of the building [of the Temple], the Israelites will gather there for the festivals and for the pilgrimages, and Israel shall reply, “Let my beloved come to His garden.” If You are there, all are there.

<b>I have come to my garden</b> in the days of the dedication of the Temple.
<b>I have gathered</b> Heb. אָרִיתִי, I gathered, and it is Mishnaic language (Shev. 1:2): “as much space as is required by a picker (אוֹרָה) and his basket.” It is also Biblical language (Ps. 80:13): “and all wayfarers have plucked its fruit (וְאָרוּה) .” This was stated in regard to the incense, for the princes burned private incense on the outside altar and it was accepted. This is something that does not apply to later generations, and because of this, it is stated: “I have eaten my sugar cane with my sugar.” There is honey that grows in canes, as it is stated (I Sam. 14:27): “into the sugar canes (בְּיַעְרַת הַדְבַשּׁ),” and יַעְרַת is a term referring to canes [or reeds], as it is stated (Exod. 2:3): “and she placed [it] in the reeds (בַּסוּף),” [which Onkelos renders:] וּשֲּׁוּיתָהּ בְּיַעְרָא, and the sugar is sucked out and the wood is discarded. But I, out of great love, ate my יַעַר with my honey: I ate the cane with the sugar, the inedible with the edible, signifying the freewill incense, and likewise, the he-goat sin offering that the princes sacrificed, although a sin offering is not sacrificed as a freewill offering, but I accepted them on that day.
<b>I have drunk my wine</b> These are the libations.

<b>I sleep</b> When I was confident and tranquil in the First Temple, I despaired of worshipping the Holy One, blessed be He, as one who sleeps and slumbers.
<b>but my heart is awake</b> This is the Holy One, blessed be He. So is this explained in the Pesikta (Rabbathi, ch. 15).
<b>but my heart is awake</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, Who is (Ps. 73:26): “the Rock of my heart and my portion,” is awake to guard me and to favor me.
<b>Hark! My beloved is knocking</b> He causes His Shechinah to rest upon the prophets and He admonishes through them by sending them betimes.
<b>Open for me</b> Do not cause Me to withdraw from you.
<b>for my head is full of dew</b> A term referring to a man who comes at night, knocking on the door of his beloved. He says thus, “Because of love for you, I have come at night at the time of dew or rain,” and the allegory is that, “My head is full of dew because I am full of goodwill and satisfaction with Abraham your father, whose deeds pleased Me like dew, and behold, I come to you, loaded with blessings and the payment of reward for good deeds if you return to Me.”
<b>my locks with the drops of the night</b> In My hands there are also many categories of types of retribution, to exact retribution from those who forsake Me and anger Me. Dew is an expression connoting pleasure.
<b>the drops of the night</b> the rains of the night, which represent hardship and weariness. רְסִיסֵי is the Targum of רְבִיבִים. (Deut. 32:2): “and like drops (וְכִרְבִיבִים) on the grass,” is translated as וְכִרְסִיסֵי מַלְקוֹשָּׁא, drops of the last rain of the season. Locks are bunches of hair stuck together, called flozels, curls, locks, and because Scripture adopted an expression of dew and rain, it adopted an expression of a head and locks, for it is usual for dew and rain to stick to the hair and locks. Both “dew” and “drops of the night” may also be explained favorably, viz. the reward for precepts that are easy to perform, like dew, and the reward for precepts that are difficult as the hardship of the drops of the night.
@3
<b>I have taken off my tunic</b> i.e., I have already accustomed myself to other ways; I can no longer return to You, as it is stated (Jer. 44:18): “But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven, etc.,” for these ways were proper in their eyes, and the expression, “I have taken off my tunic...I have bathed my feet,” is the language of an adulterous wife, who does not wish to open the door for her husband. And since Scripture commenced with the language of, “I sleep...Hark! My beloved is knocking,” it concludes with an expression apropos to an expression of knocking at the door at the time of retiring to sleep at night.
@4
<b>My beloved stretched forth his hand from the hole</b> which is beside the door, and I saw his hand, and the stirring of my insides turned within me to return to his love and to open for him.
@5
<b>I arose to open for my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh</b> wholeheartedly and with a desiring soul, as one who adorns herself to endear herself to her husband with a pleasant scent.
<b>with flowing myrrh</b> with a fragrance that flows and spreads to all parts.
@6
<b>but my beloved had hidden and was gone</b> Heb. חָמַק, was hidden and concealed from me, like (below 7:2): “the curves (חֲמוּקֵי) of your thighs,” the hidden places of your thighs, because the thigh is hidden. [Also] (Jer. 31:21): “How long will you hide (תִתְחַמָּקִי),” will you hide and cover yourself because of the shame that you betrayed Me?
<b>my soul went out when he spoke</b> for he said, “I will not come into your house because at first you did not wish to open.”
<b>The watchmen who patrol the city found me</b> and apprehend the thieves who prowl at night.
<b>they smote me and wounded me</b> They inflicted a wound upon me. Every [instance of] פֶצַע is an expression of a wound [inflicted] by a weapon, navredure in Old French, a wound.
<b>my jewelry</b> Heb. רְדִידִי. My jewelry that was hammered and beaten, upon me, and the entire episode is an expression of a wife of one’s youth who bewails the husband of her youth and searches for him. And this is the allegorical meaning:
<b>[4] My beloved stretched forth his hand from the hole</b> when I said, “I have bathed my feet,” and I will not open for You, and I will not repent of the idolatry that I have chosen.
<b>stretched forth his hand</b> and demonstrated His vengeance in the days of Ahaz, and He brought upon him the army of the king of Aram (II Chron. 28:5f): “and they smote him and captured from him a great captivity, etc. And Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah one hundred and twenty thousand in one day.”
<b>and my insides stirred because of him</b> Hezekiah his son came and repented with all his heart to seek the Holy One, blessed be He, and his entire generation was wholehearted; there never arose a generation in Israel like them, as is delineated in [the chapter entitled] חֵלֶק (Sanh. 94b): They searched from Dan to Beersheba and did not find an ignoramus, from Gebeth to Antioch, and did not find a man or woman who was not well versed in the laws of ritual contamination and purity, and this is the meaning of, “my hands dripped with myrrh, etc.” It is also stated regarding Josiah (II Kings 23:25): “Now before him there was no king like him, etc.,” for he saw the retribution that had come upon Manasseh and upon Amon, to fulfill the words, “he stretched forth his hand from the hole, and my insides stirred because of him.”
<b>[6] I opened for my beloved, but my beloved had hidden and was gone</b> He did not nullify His decree, as it is stated regarding Hezekiah (Isa. 39:6f): “Behold a time shall come when everything in your palace, etc. shall be carried off to Babylonia. And...[some] of your sons...whom you shall beget.” These are Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, and also [as it is stated] concerning Josiah, through Huldah the prophetess (II Kings 22:16): “Behold, I bring calamity upon this place and upon its inhabitants, etc.” And Scripture states: (ibid. 23:25ff): “Now, before him there was no king like him... Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn back from His great wrath, for His wrath was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked Him. And the Lord said: I will remove Judah too from before Me as I have removed Israel, and I will reject this city.”
<b>my soul went out when he spoke</b> It left me when He spoke this word.
<b>I sought him, but found him not</b> Now if you ask: Was not Jeremiah standing and prophesying during the days of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah, (Mal. 3: 7): “Return to Me, and I will return to you”? This was not to nullify the decree, but to mitigate the punishment and to prepare their kingdom for the time when they would return from the exile, to plant them without being uprooted and to build it without being demolished.

<b>The watchmen...found me</b> Nebuchadnezzar and his armies.

<b>took my jewelry</b> the Temple.
<b>the watchmen of the walls</b> Even the ministering angels, who were guarding its walls, as it is stated (Isa. 62:6): “On your walls, O Jerusalem, etc.” They ignited the fire upon it, as it is written (Lam. 1:13): “From above He has hurled fire, etc.”
@8
<b>I adjure you</b> [You] heathens, Nebuchadnezzar’s men, who saw Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah submitting themselves to the fiery furnace, and Daniel to the lions’ den because of prayer, and Mordecai’s generation in the days of Haman...
<b>if you find my beloved</b> in the future, on judgment day, for He will request you to testify about me, as it is stated (Isa. 43:9): “Let them p resent their witnesses, that they may be deemed just.”
<b>what will you tell him</b> you will testify on my behalf that because of love for Him, I suffered harsh tortures among you. Let Nebuchadnezzar come and testify... let Eliphaz and Zophar and all the prophets of the heathens [come] and testify about me that I fulfilled the Torah.
@9
<b>What is your beloved more than another beloved</b> This is what the nations were asking Israel, “What is it about your God more than all the other gods, that you allow yourselves to be burned and hanged because of Him?”

@10
<b>My beloved is white</b> Heb. צַח, white, like (Lam. 4:7): “they were whiter (צַחוּ) than milk.”
<b>and ruddy</b> I will first explain the entire section according to its simple meaning, i.e., the praise of the beauty of a young man, when he is white and his face is ruddy.
<b>surrounded by myriads</b> surrounded by many armies; His armies are many. Many myriads are called רְבָבָה, as it is said: (Ezek. 16: 7): “Myriads (רְבָבָה) like the plants of the field have I made you.”
@11
<b>His head</b> glistens like the finest gold. כֶּתֶם is a term referring to the treasures of kings which they store in their treasure houses, and similarly, (Lam. 4:1): “[How] changed is the fine gold jewelry (הַכֶּתֶם),” and similarly, (Job 31:24): “and to jewelry (לַכֶּתֶם) I said, ‘My confidence,’” and similarly, (Prov. 25:12): “and jewelry of finest gold (כָתֶם).”
<b>his locks are curled</b> Heb. תַּלְתַּלִים, an expression of hanging (תְּלוּיִים), pendeloys in Old French, (locks of hair) hanging.
<b>black as a raven</b> All these are beauty for a young man.
@12
<b>His eyes are like doves beside rivulets of water</b> By rivulets of water his eyes are as beautiful as the eyes of doves. Rivulets of water are beautiful to behold, and the young men go there to swim, so does the poet praise the eyes of “my beloved.” When he gazes upon the rivulets of water, they resemble the beauty of the eyes of doves.
<b>bathing in milk</b> the eyes of my beloved in milk.
<b>fitly set</b> All this is an expression of beauty, neither protruding too much nor sunken, but set on מִלֵאת, their sockets. (Other editions: the eye according to the socket.) The literal meaning parallels the allegorical meaning. And it is a term used to refer to anything made to fit a socket which is made for it as a base, like (Exod. 25:7): “stones to be fit (מְלֻאִים)”; (ibid. 28:17): “And you shall set (וּמִלֵאתָ) into it settings of (מִלֻאַת) stones.”
@13
<b>His jaws are like a bed of spice</b> in those beds are spice plants.
<b>growths of aromatic plants</b> Heb. מִגְדְלוֹת מֶרְקָחִים, aromatic plants, growths of aromatic plants which are compounded with the art of an apothecary.
@14
<b>wheels of gold</b> Heb. גְלִילֵי זָהָב, like wheels of gold.
<b>set with chrysolite</b> Every term referring to the setting of a precious stone in gold is called מִלֵאת.
<b>a block</b> Heb. עֶשֶּׁת, an expression of (Jer. 5: 28): “They became fat; they became thick (עָשְּׁתוּ).” A thick mass is called עֶשֶּׁת, masse in French, a mass.
<b>ivory</b> Heb. שֵּׁן, from the bones of the elephant.
<b>overlaid with sapphires</b> Heb. מְעֻלֶפֶת, adorned and decorated with sapphires, an expression of (Gen. 38:14) וַתִּתְעַלָף, which the Targum renders: וְאִתַקְנַת, and she adorned herself.
@15
<b>His legs are</b> as pillars of marble, founded upon sockets of fine gold.
<b>pillars of marble</b> Heb. שֵּׁשּׁ, pillars of marble, שַּׁיִשּׁ, and a similar word appears in Megillath Esther (1:6): “on silver rods and marble (שֵּׁשּׁ) columns,” and his appearance is as tall as the cedars of the Lebanon.
<b>chosen as the cedars</b> chosen among the sons as the cedar among the other trees.
@16
<b>His palate is sweet</b> His words are pleasant.
<b>this is my beloved</b> This is the likeness of my beloved, and this is the likeness of my friend, and because of all these things I have become ill for his love. The allegorical meaning, symbolizing the Holy One, blessed be He, is as follows:
<b>[10] My beloved is white</b> to whiten my iniquities. Clear and white; when He appeared at Sinai, He appeared as an old man, teaching instructions, and so, when He sits in judgment (Dan. 7:9): “His garment was like white snow, and the hair of His head was like clean wool.”
<b>and ruddy</b> to exact retribution upon His enemies, as it is stated (Isa. 63.2): “Why is Your clothing red?”
<b>surrounded by myriads</b> Many armies encompass Him.
<b>[11] His head is as the finest gold</b> The beginning of His words shone like finest gold, and so Scripture says (Ps. 119:130): “The commencement of Your words enlightens.” The commencement of, “I am the Lord your God” showed them first that He has the right of sovereignty over them, and He then issued His decrees upon them.
<b>his locks are curled</b> Heb. קְוֻצוֹתָיו תַּלְתַּלִים. Upon every point (קוֹץ וָקוֹץ) [of the letters of the Sepher Torah] were heaps of heaps (תִּלֵי תִִּלִים) of halachoth.
<b>black as a raven</b> because it was written before Him in black fire on white fire. Another explanation: His locks were curled when He appeared on the sea, appearing like a young man mightily waging war.
<b>[12] His eyes are like doves beside rivulets of water</b> Like doves, whose eyes look toward their dovecotes, so are His eyes on the synagogues and study halls, for there are the sources of Torah, which is compared to water.
<b>bathing in milk</b> When they look into the judgment, they clarify the law in its true light, to justify the just, to give him what he deserves, and to condemn the guilty, to repay his [evil] way upon his head.
<b>fitly set</b> on the fullness of the world. They wander over the entire earth, gazing upon good and evil. Another explanation: Torah scholars, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, makes as eyes to illuminate the world, just as the eyes illuminate for man; like doves that wander from dovecote to dovecote to seek their food, so do they go from the study hall of one sage to the study hall of another sage, to seek the explanations of the Torah.
<b>by rivulets of water</b> in the study halls, which are the sources of the water of Torah.
<b>bathing in milk</b> Since he calls them eyes, and the eye (עַיִן) is a feminine noun, bathing (רוֹחֲצוֹת) is in the feminine conjugation. They cleanse themselves with the milk of Torah and whiten (clarify) its mysteries and enigmas.
<b>fitly set</b> They resolve the matters appropriately. Another explanation: His eyes עֵינָיו, [like] עִנְיָנָיו His topics. The sections of the Torah, the halachoth, and the Mishnayoth are like doves which are comely in their walk beside the rivulets of water, [i.e.,] in the study halls; bathing in milk, made clear as milk, as I have explained.
<b>[13] His jaws</b> the commandments of Mount Sinai, for He showed them a friendly and smiling countenance.
<b>his lips are like roses</b> the commandments (lit. statements) that He spoke in the Tent of Meeting, which are for appeasement and for atonement and for a pleasant fragrance: the law of the sin offering, the guilt offering, the meal offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering.
<b>[14] His hands</b> the Tablets, which He gave with His right hand, which are the work of His hands.
<b>wheels of gold</b> These are the commandments, about which it is said (Ps. 19:11): “They are to be desired more than gold, yea more than much fine gold.” Said Rabbi Joshua the son of Nehemiah: They were made miraculously. They were of sapphire, yet they could be rolled (Song Rabbah, Tanch. Ki Thissa 26). Another explanation: because they bring about (lit. roll) much good to the world.
<b>set with chrysolite</b> He included the 613 commandments in the Decalogue.
<b>his abdomen is [as] a block of ivory</b> This is the Priestly Code (Leviticus), placed in the center of the Five Books of the Pentateuch, like the intestines, which are set in the middle of the body.
<b>[as] a block of ivory, overlaid with sapphires</b> It appears as smooth as a block of ivory, and is set with many details [derived from] similar wordings, general principles, and inferences from minor to major.
<b>[15] founded upon sockets of fine gold</b> Said Rabbi Eleazar Hakkappar: This pillar has a capitol above and a base below. Said Rabbi Samuel the son of Gadda: The sections of the Torah have a capitol above and a base below, and they are juxtaposed before them and after them, e.g., the sections of the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee year, [are juxtaposed to] (Lev. 25:14): “And if you transact a sale,” to teach you how severe the dust (i.e., a minor infraction) of the Sabbatical Year is, as appears in Tractates Bava Metzia and Arachin (30b). Also, like (Num. 27:16): “May the Lord...appoint a man over the congregation,” and (ibid. 29: 2): “Command...My sacrifice, My bread.” Before you command Me about My children, command them about Me (Sifrei Num. 27:23), and similarly, many [such instances]. Therefore, it is stated: “His legs are [as] pillars of marble, founded, etc.”
<b>his appearance is like the Lebanon</b> One who reflects and ponders over His words finds in them blossoms and sprouts, like a forest which blooms. So are the words of Torah—whoever meditates over them constantly finds new explanations in them.
<b>chosen</b> Heb. בָּחוּר, chosen as the cedars, which are chosen for building and for strength and height.
<b>[16] His palate is sweet</b> His words are pleasant, e.g. (Lev. 19:28): “And you shall not make a wound in your flesh for one who has died...I am the Lord,” faithful to pay reward. Is there a palate sweeter than this? Do not wound yourselves, and you will receive reward. (Ezek. 33:19): “And when a wicked man repents of his wickedness and performs justice and righteousness, he shall live because of them.” Iniquities are accounted to him as merits. Is there a palate sweeter than this?

<b>Where has your beloved gone</b> The nations taunt and provoke Israel, “Where has your Beloved gone?” Why has He left you abandoned like a widow?
<b>Where has your beloved turned</b> When He returned and caused His spirit to rest on Cyrus, and sanctioned the rebuilding of the Temple, and they commenced to build, they came and said to them, “Where has your Beloved turned?” If He is returning to you, we will seek Him with you, as is stated (Ezra 4:1f): “Now the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a Temple, etc. And they approached Zerubbabel, etc.: Let us build with you, for like you we seek your God, etc.” But their intention was for evil, in order to stop the work. And they replied to them:

<b>My beloved has gone down to his garden</b> He commanded us to build His Temple, and He will be there with us.
<b>to the spice beds</b> to the place where the incense is burned.
<b>to graze in the gardens</b> And further, He went down to pasture His flocks in the gardens where they were scattered, i.e., those who did not come up from the exile. He causes His Shechinah to rest upon them in the synagogues and in the study halls.
<b>and to gather roses</b> He listens and hearkens to those who speak of His Torah, to collect their merits and to inscribe them in a memorial book before Him, as it is stated (Mal. 3: 16): “Then the God-fearing men spoke...[and a book of remembrance was written before Him...]” Now, concerning your request to seek with us and to build with us, “I am my Beloved’s,” but you are not His, and you shall not build with us, as it is stated (Ezra 4:3): “It is not for you and for us to build a House for our God,” and Scripture states further (Neh. 2:20): “and you have no portion or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”

<b>You are fair, my beloved, as Tirzah</b> And the Holy One, blessed be He, praises her for this: You are fair, my beloved, when you are desirable (רְצוּיָה) to me. So it is expounded in Sifrei (Deut. 6:9).
<b>comely</b> are you now as at first in Jerusalem.

<b>Turn away your eyes from me</b> as a young man whose betrothed is dear and sweet to him, and her eyes are comely, and he says to her, “Turn away your eyes from me, for when I see you, my heart becomes haughty and proud, and my spirit becomes arrogant, and I cannot resist.”
<b>they have made me haughty</b> Heb. הִרְהִיבֻנִי. They made my heart arrogant, like (Ps. 90:10): “but their pride (וְרָהְבָּם) is toil and pain”; (Isa. 30:7): “They are haughty (רַהַב), idlers,” asoijer in Old French, to make proud. The allegorical meaning is as follows: The Holy One, blessed be He, said: In this Temple, it is impossible to restore to you the Ark, the Ark cover, and the cherubim, which made Me proud in the First Temple, to show you great affection, until you betrayed Me.
<b>your hair is like a flock of goats</b> in the small, the tender, and the slight ones among you, there is much praise.

<b>Your teeth are like a flock of ewes</b> The officers and the mighty men among you are all [devoted to] goodness.
<b>like a flock of ewes</b> This ewe is entirely devoted to holiness: its wool is for the blue thread, its flesh for a sacrifice, its horns for shofaroth, its thighs for flutes, its intestines for harps, its hide for a drum; but the wicked were likened to dogs, for they have nothing to offer to holiness.

<b>There are sixty queens</b> Abraham and his descendants (Song Zuta). The sons of Keturah are sixteen. Ishmael and his sons are thirteen. Isaac and his sons are three. The sons of Jacob are twelve. The sons of Esau are sixteen, thus totaling sixty. And if you say that Timna should be excluded because she was a woman, then count Abraham in the number.
<b>and eighty concubines</b> Noah and his sons until Abraham, all the generations of those who left the Ark (Song Zuta)—you will find them to be eighty. And just as the queens, who are the kings’ wives, are superior in greatness to the concubines, so were Abraham and his descendants of great esteem, and superior in their esteem over everyone, as you will see. Hagar was the daughter of kings [and became Sarah’s maidservant (Gen. Rabbah 45:1)]. Timna was the daughter of rulers and became Esau’s concubine (ibid. 82:15), and Scripture says (Gen. 14: 17): “to the Valley of Shaveh (שָׁוֶה), etc.” They all unanimously (הֻשְווּ) resolved to make Abraham king over them.

In the beginning, Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah, but not a king, and they were subjugated to Persia and to Greece, and afterwards, the house of the Hasmoneans defeated them and they became kings.
<b>awesome as the bannered legions</b> awesome among the mighty men as the bannered legions of kings. All this the Holy One, blessed be He, praises the congregation of Israel, “You are fair, my beloved, as Tirzah,” and the entire matter until here.

<b>the pomegranates were in bloom</b> [This refers to] those who fulfill the commandments, who are full of merits. Why were the Israelites compared to a nut? Just as this nut—all you see is wood, and what is inside is not discernible, and you crack it and find it full of sections of edible food, so are the Israelites modest and humble in their deeds, and the students among them are not discernible, and they do not boast by announcing their [own] praise. But if you examine him, you find him full of wisdom. There are many additional homiletic interpretations of this matter. Just as if this nut falls into the mud, its interior does not become sullied, so are the Israelites exiled among the nations and smitten with many blows, but their deeds are not sullied.

<b>I did not know</b> The congregation of Israel laments: I did not know to beware of sin, that I should retain my honor and my greatness, and I erred in the matter of groundless hatred and controversy, which intensified during the reign of the Hasmonean kings, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, until one of them brought the kingdom of Rome and received the kingship from their hand and became their vassal, and since then, my soul made me to be chariots, that the nobility of other nations ride upon me.

We will appoint from you governors and rulers, like (Exod. 18: 21): “And you shall appoint (תֶחֱזֶה) from all the people.” So did Rabbi Tanhuma interpret it (Bamidbar 11). Another explanation for “and we will gaze upon you”: We will ponder what greatness to give you, but she says, “What will you see for the Shulammite?” What greatness can you allot me, that will equal my greatness, or even the greatness of the divisions of the dances of the encampments in the desert?

<b>How fair are your feet in sandals</b> They say to her: We want you to cleave to us because of the beauty and the esteem that we saw in you when you were still beautiful.
<b>How fair are your feet</b> in the festive pilgrimages, O daughter of princes!
<b>The curves of your thighs are like jewels</b> A collection of gold jewels is called חֲלִי כֶתֶם, al chali in Arabic. And our Sages interpreted this as referring to the holes of the foundations [of the altar] for the libations, which were created during the Six Days of Creation, round as a thigh.
<b>like jewels</b> Heb. חֲלָאִים, like the hollow of (חוּלְיַת) a pit.
<b>the handiwork of a craftsman</b> [They are] the [work of the] hands of the Holy One, blessed be He. [See] Tractate Succah (49a).
<b>craftsman</b> Heb. אֳמָן, like אוּמָן. In the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, the Israelites praise Him from top to bottom. They commence, so to speak, from “His head is as finest gold,” and progressively descend to “His legs are as pillars of marble,” since they come to appease Him, to draw down His Shechinah from the heavenly abodes to the earthly abodes. He, however, counts their praises from bottom to top: “How fair are your feet!” and He progressively counts until, “Your head upon you is like Carmel,” until He comes to draw them to Him.
@3
<b>Your navel is [like] a round basin</b> Your navel is like a basin of clear water with which they wash, and it [the basin] is made of marble, which in Arabic is called “sahar.” He compares it to a round basin because the navel is shaped like a round hole. This praise does not refer to a woman’s beauty as the above praise does, for [in] the above, her beloved praises her, but here, her companions praise her about her deeds, saying: You are worthy to join us. The image symbolizes the Chamber of Hewn Stone, which is situated in the “navel” of the world.
<b>where no mixed wine is lacking</b> No beverage will ever cease [to be found] there; he wishes to say that no words of instruction will cease or end from there.
<b>your belly is [like] a stack of wheat</b> which everyone needs.
<b>fenced in with roses</b> fenced and hedged about with roses. A light fence suffices her, and no one breaches it to enter. For example, a bridegroom enters the nuptial canopy, his heart longing for the nuptials and for the love of his marriage. When he comes to cohabit with her, she says to him, “I have perceived a drop of blood like [the size of] a mustard seed.” He turns his face the other way. Now no snake bit him, nor did a scorpion sting him. [Similarly,] one passes by on the road and sees freshly ripened fruit at the top of the fig trees. He stretches out his hand to take [them]. They tell him, “These belong to owners,” and he too withdraws his hand because of [the prohibition] of theft. This is the meaning of “she is fenced in with roses.”
@4
<b>Your two breasts</b> the two Tablets. Another explanation: the king and the high priest.
@5
<b>Your neck</b> the Temple and the altar, which are erect and tall, and the Chamber of Hewn Stone, which is also there, made for strength and for a shield, like an ivory tower.
<b>your eyes</b> are like pools (בְּרֵכוֹת) in Heshbon, through which water flows. So are your eyes by the gate of the multitudes. Your sages, when they sit in the gates of Jerusalem, the city of multitudes, and engage in the computation (חֶשְּׁבּוֹן) of the seasons and the signs of the zodiac—their wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the peoples flow like pools of water. Alternatively, we can explain בְּרֵכוֹת בְּחֶשְּׁבּוֹן to mean doves, and this is a Mishnaic usage: If one buys the doves of a dovecote, he must let the first brood (בְּרִיכָה) fly away; covedes in Old French, covey, brood.
<b>your face is as the tower of Lebanon</b> Heb. אַפֵּךְ. I cannot explain this to mean a nose, either in reference to its simple meaning or in reference to its allegorical meaning, for what praise of beauty is there in a nose that is large and erect as a tower? I say, therefore, that אַפֵּךְ means a face. Now the reason he uses the singular and does not say אַפַּיִךְ, is that he speaks of the forehead, which is the main recognizable feature of the face, as it is said (Isa. 3:9): “The recognition of their faces testified against them.” And you should know, for he progressively praises them from bottom to top”—Your eyes are [like] pools in Heshbon,” and after them the forehead, and so do the nations praise (Ezek. 3:8): “and your forehead is strong against” the forehead of all who come to harm you and entice you.
<b>as the tower of Lebanon, facing towards Damascus</b> I saw [the following] in the Midrash (Zuta): This is the house of the Lebanon forest, which King Solomon made. Whoever stood on it could look and count how many houses there were in Damascus. Another explanation: Your face looks towards Damascus; looks forward to the coming of the gates of Jerusalem until Damascus, for it is destined to expand as far as Damascus.
@6
<b>Your head upon you is like Carmel</b> These are the tephillin [phylacteries] of the head, about which it is said (Deut. 28:10): “And all the peoples of the world will see that the name of the Lord is called upon you, and they will fear you.” That is their strength and their fear, like a rock of the mountains, and the Carmel is the most prominent of the mountains.
<b>and the braided locks of your head</b> The braided hair of your Nazirites are as beautiful with commandments as braided purple [ropes].
<b>and the braided locks of your head</b> Heb. וְדַלַת רֹאשֵּׁךְ, because the braid is lifted up (מֻדְלֵת) on the highest part of the head.
<b>the king is bound in the tresses</b> The name of the Omnipresent is bound in the locks, as is stated (Num. 6:7): “The crown of his God is on his head.”
<b>tresses</b> Heb. רְהָטִים, courants in French; currents, windings [tresses]. This is what they call the fringes of the sashes, with which they tie the girdles. Another explanation of מֶלֶךְ אָסוּר בָּרְהָטִים: The Holy One, blessed be He, is bound with love to the commandments and to the swiftness with which you run before Him.
@7
<b>How fair and how pleasant you are</b> After having praised each limb in detail, he includes everything in a general statement: How fair you are in your entirety, and how pleasant you are, to cleave to you with a love that is proper to delight in.
@8
<b>This, your stature, is like a palm tree</b> We saw the beauty of your stature in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, when all the nations were kneeling and falling before the image, but you stood as erect as this palm tree.
<b>and your breasts are like clusters [of dates]</b> [This refers to] Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, who were like breasts for you to suckle from. They were like clusters [of dates], which shower liquid; so did they nurse lavishly and teach everyone that there is no fear like fear of You. Until this point, the nations praise Him. From here on are the words of the Shechinah to reveal Israel, who are among the nations.
@9
<b>I said: Let me climb up the palm tree</b> I boast of you among the heavenly hosts, that I should be exalted and hallowed through you in the lower realms, for you will hallow My name among the nations.
<b>let me seize its boughs</b> and I will seize and cleave to you. סַנְסִנִים are boughs.
<b>and let your breasts be now</b> And now, cause my words to be realized, that you will not be seduced after the nations, and may the good and wise among you be steadfast in their faith, to retort to those who seduce them, so that the small ones among you will learn from them.
@10
<b>And your palate is like the best wine</b> Be careful with your answers that they should be like the best wine.
<b>that glides down smoothly to my beloved</b> I am careful to answer them that I will remain steadfast in my faith, that my palate will go before my beloved with straightforward love, which emanates from the heart, and not from deceit and guile.
<b>like the best wine</b> which makes the lips of the sleeping speak. Even my ancestors in the grave will rejoice with me and give thanks for their portion. דוֹבֵב means moving, promued in Old French, stimulates (to talk), and its basis is an expression of speech, and so is the reply: I am my beloved’s, and he also longs for me.
@12
<b>Come, my beloved, let us go out to the field</b> Our Rabbis expounded in Eruvin (21b): The congregation of Israel said, “O Lord of the Universe, do not judge me like the inhabitants of large cities, where there is robbery and immorality, but like the inhabitants of villages, who are craftsmen, and engage in the Torah amidst hardship.
<b>let us lodge in the villages</b> Heb. בַּכְּפָרִִים. Let us lodge among the disbelievers (בַּכּוֹפְרִִים). Come and I will show You the sons of Esau, upon whom You bestowed plenty, but who do not believe in You.
@13
<b>Let us arise early to the vineyards</b> These are the synagogues and the study halls.
<b>let us see whether the vine has blossomed</b> These are the students of the Torah.
<b>the tiny grapes have developed</b> When the blossom falls off and the grapes are discernible, that is the development of the סְמָדַר, and he compares the students of the Mishnah to them, because they provide pleasure by teaching Torah.
<b>the pomegranates have lost their flowers</b> when they become ripe, and the flower around them falls off. הֵנֵצוּ means its flower (נִצוּ), and he compares the Talmud students to them, who possess full wisdom and are fit to teach.
<b>there I will give you my love</b> There I will show You my glory and the glory of my sons and daughters.
@14
<b>the pots</b> The pots of the good and the bad figs, as it is stated (Jer. 24:1f.): “The Lord showed me, and behold, two pots of figs, etc. One pot [contained] very good figs, etc., and the other pot [contained] very bad figs, which could not be eaten.” These are the transgressors of Israel. Now, both of them have given forth their fragrance. They all seek Your countenance.
<b>and on our doorways are all manner of sweet fruits</b> We have in our hands the reward for [fulfilling] many commandments.
<b>both new and old</b> that which the Sages innovated, as well as the old, which You wrote for me.
<b>which I have hidden away for you</b> For Your name and for Your service I have hidden them away in my heart. Another explanation: I stored them away to show You that I have fulfilled them.

@1
<b>O that you were like my brother</b> that you would come to console me as Joseph did his brothers, who did evil to him, and it is stated concerning him (Gen. 50:21): “and he consoled them.”
<b>I would find you outside, I would kiss you</b> I would find Your prophets speaking in Your name, and I would embrace them and kiss them. I also know that they would not despise me, for Your love is worthy that Your beloved should go around after You.
@2
<b>to the house of my mother</b> the Temple.
<b>who instructed me</b> as You were accustomed to do in the Tent of Meeting.
<b>I would give you to drink some spiced wine</b> libations.
<b>of the juice</b> sweet wine.
@4
<b>I adjure you</b> Now the congregation of Israel addresses the nations, “Even though I complain and lament, my Beloved holds on to my hand, and He is my support in my exile; therefore, I adjure you.”
<b>why should you awaken, and why should you arouse</b> for it will not avail you.
@5
<b>Who is this</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, and His tribunal say about the congregation of Israel, “Who is this?” How esteemed is this one, who was exalted from the desert with all the good gifts! There she was exalted at the giving of the Torah and with the cleaving of the Shechinah, and her love is visible to all, and she is still in her exile.
<b>embracing her beloved</b> Heb. מִתְרַפֶּקֶת, attached to her beloved, admitting that she is his companion and clinging to him. רפק in Arabic is רַפְקְתָא, union.
<b>Under the apple tree I aroused you</b> So she says in the request of the affection of her beloved: “Under the apple tree I aroused You.” I remember that under Mount Sinai, formed over my head as a sort of apple tree, I aroused You. That is an expression of the affection of the wife of one’s youth, who arouses her beloved at night when he is asleep on his bed, and embraces him and kisses him.
<b>there your mother was in travail with you</b> We have said that the Holy One, blessed be He, called her His mother (above 3:11). There she became Your mother.
<b>was in travail</b> Heb. חִבְּלָתְךָ, an expression of (Hos. 13: 13): “birth pangs (חֶבְלֵי יוֹלֵדָה),” birth pangs came to her from you, like (Jer. 10:20): “my children have left me (יְצָאֻנִי),” they went out of me.
@6
<b>Place me like a seal</b> for the sake of that love, You shall seal me on Your heart, so that You should not forget me, and You will see.
<b>for love is as strong as death</b> The love that I loved You is to me equal to my death, for I was killed for Your sake.
<b>zeal is as strong as the grave</b> [This refers to] the quarrel that the nations were jealous and quarreled with me because of You. [The word] קִנְאָה everywhere [in Scripture] means enprenement in Old French, zealous anger, an expression of determination to wreak vengeance.
<b>fire of a great flame</b> coals of a strong fire that comes from the force of the flame of Gehinnom. The cantillation symbol of the zakef gadol, which punctuates רִשְּׁפֵּי (coals of) teaches us about the word אֵשּׁ (fire) that it is connected to שַּׁלְהֶבֶתיָהּ, meaning fire of a great flame, [or a flame of God, see Ibn Ezra].
@7
<b>Many waters cannot quench the love</b> Since he refers to them with an expression of coals, the language of “cannot quench” is appropriate for them.
<b>Many waters</b> the heathen nations.
<b>rivers</b> their princes and their kings.
<b>nor can...flood it</b> (not] through strength and fear nor [even] through enticement and seduction.
<b>should a man give all his property for love</b> in exchange for Your love.
<b>they would despise him</b> On all these the Holy One, blessed be He, and His tribunal testify that to this extent the congregation of Israel embraces her Beloved.
@8
<b>We have a...sister</b> in the lower realms, who is united, attaches herself [to us], and is desirous to be with us; she is small and humbles herself more than all the [other] nations, as it is stated (Deut. 7: 7): “Not because you are more numerous, etc.,” for they consider themselves insignificant.
<b>a...sister</b> Heb. אָחוֹת, an expression of joining (אִחוּי), (Moed Katan 26a): “These are the tears that may not be reattached (מִתְאָחִי).”
<b>who has no breasts</b> as it is stated concerning the exile of Egypt: (Ezek. 16: 7): “breasts fashioned,” when the time of the redemption arrived, but this one has yet no breasts. Her time has not yet reached the time of love.
<b>what shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for</b> when the heathens whisper about her to destroy her, as it is stated (Ps. 83:5): “Come, let us destroy them from [being] a nation.”
@9
<b>If she be a wall</b> If she is strong in her faith and in her fear [of God], to be against them like a copper wall, that they should not enter her midst, meaning that she will not intermarry with them, and they will not come into her, and she will not be seduced by them.
<b>we will build upon her a silver turret</b> We will be to her as a fortified city and for a crown and for beauty, and we will build for her the Holy City and the chosen Temple.
<b>and if she be a door</b> which turns on its hinges, and when one knocks on it, it opens. She, too, if she opens for them so that they enter her and she [enters] them.
<b>we will enclose her with cedar boards</b> We will put into her door wooden boards which rot and which the worm gnaws and eats. Thereupon, the congregation of Israel will say:
@10
<b>I am a wall</b> a strong [wall] in the love of my Beloved.
<b>and my breasts are like towers</b> These are the synagogues and the study halls, which nurture Israel with words of Torah.
<b>then</b> when I said this.
<b>I was in his eyes as one who finds peace</b> like a bride who is found perfect, and finds peace in her husband’s house.
@11
<b>Solomon had a vineyard</b> This is the congregation of Israel, as it is said (Isa. 5:7): “For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel.”
<b>In Baal-Hamon</b> in Jerusalem, which is populous and has a multitude of people.
<b>Baal</b> an expression denoting a plain, like (Jos. 12:7): “from Baal-Gad in the valley of Lebanon.”
<b>he gave the vineyard to the keepers</b> He delivered it into the hands of harsh masters: Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom. In Midrash Shir Hashirim, I found some support to [the theory that] these keepers are the kingdoms.
<b>each one brought for the fruit thereof</b> whatever they could collect from them: head taxes, tithes, and illegal foreclosures; they collected everything from them to bring into their homes.
@12
<b>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me</b> for on the day of judgment, the Holy One, blessed be He, will bring them to justice, and He will say, “My vineyard, even though I delivered it into your hands, it is Mine, and before Me is all that you seized for yourselves, its fruit. And that which you collected from them is not hidden from Me.” And they will say:
<b>you, O Solomon, shall have the thousand</b> “The thousand pieces of silver that we collected from them, we will return everything to You.”
<b>and those who watch its fruit, two hundred</b> And we will add much more of our own, and we will give it to them, to their heads and their sages, as it is stated (Isa. 60:17): “Instead of copper I will bring gold.”
<b>who watch its fruit</b> These are the Torah scholars, and those payments are for the Torah scholars, as it is stated (Isa. 23:18): “but those who sit before the Lord shall have her commerce” and her hire, i.e., that of Tyre. And it can also be explained: and two hundred for those who watch its fruit—according to the law of a person who derives benefit from consecrated objects, who pays the principal and a fifth. We too will pay, for (Jer. 2:3): “Israel is holy to the Lord, the first of His grain,” the principal and a fifth, a fifth of the principal, and two hundred is a fifth of a thousand.
@13
<b>You, who sit in the gardens</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, says to the congregation of Israel, “You, who are scattered in exile, grazing in the gardens of strangers and sitting in synagogues and study halls...”
<b>the friends hearken to your voice</b> The ministering angels, your friends, children of God like you, hearken and come to listen to your voice in the synagogues.
<b>let me hear [it]</b> And afterwards, they will declare [God’s] sanctity, as it is said (Job 38:7): “When the morning stars sing together.” These are the Israelites. And afterwards, “and all the angels of God will shout.”
@14
<b>Flee, my beloved</b> from this exile and redeem us from among them.
<b>and liken yourself to a gazelle</b> to hasten the redemption and to cause Your Shechinah to rest.

<b>Now it came to pass in the days when the judges judged</b> Before King Saul reigned, when the generations were governed by judges, and this was in the days of Ibzan, as our Sages said (B.B. 91a, Targum ad loc.): Ibzan is Boaz.
<b>and a man went</b> He was very wealthy, and the leader of the generation. He left the Land of Israel for regions outside the Land because of stinginess, for he begrudged the poor who came to press him; therefore he was punished.
@2
<b>Ephrathites</b> Heb. אֶפְרָתִים, important people, likewise, (I Sam. 1:1): “the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite,” a palace dweller (Ruth Rabbah 2:5). Look how important they were, for Eglon the king of Moab married off his daughter to Mahlon, for the master said (ibid. 9): Ruth was the daughter of Eglon. Another explanation: Ephrathites: Bethlehem was called Ephrath.
@3
<b>Naomi’s husband</b> Why is this stated? From here they (our Sages) derived (Sanh. 22b): A man does not die except concerning his wife. (And Scripture states, “Naomi’s husband”; that is to say that because he was her husband and ruled over her, and she was subordinate to him, therefore the divine standard of justice struck him and not her.)
@5
<b>both...also</b> What is the meaning of “also”? First their possessions were smitten, and their camels and their cattle died, and afterwards they too died.
@7
<b>Then she went forth from the place</b> Why is this stated? It is already stated, “and she returned from the fields of Moab,” and from where would she return if not from the place where she was? But Scripture wishes to tell [us] that the departure of a righteous person from a place is conspicuous, and makes an impression. Its splendor has turned away; its majesty has turned away; the praise of a city has turned away, and likewise (Gen. 28:10): “And Jacob went forth from Beersheba.”
@12
<b>for I have become too old to marry</b> that I should marry someone and bear sons, that you should marry them, for they are not forbidden to you and you are not forbidden to them as far as the prohibition against marrying the wife of a brother who is deceased, for she does not require a levirate marriage because Mahlon and Chilion were not halachically married to them because they were gentiles, and had not converted, and now they were coming to convert, as it is stated (verse 10): “[No], but we will return with you to your people.” From now on, we will become one people.
<b>that I should say that I have hope</b> for even if my heart told me that I have hope to marry again and to bear sons.
<b>Even if I had a husband tonight</b> and more than this, even if I conceived male offspring tonight.
<b>and even if I had borne sons</b> or even if I had already borne sons.
@13
<b>Would you wait for them</b> Heb. תְּשַּׂבֵּרְנָה. This is a question: Would you wait for them until they grew up? This is an expression similar to (Ps. 146:5): “his hope (שִּׂבְרוֹ) is in the Lord his God.”
<b>Would you shut yourselves off</b> Heb. תֵּעָגֵנָה. An expression of being bound and imprisoned, like (Taanith 3: 8): “He made a round hole (עָג עוּגָה) and stood within it.” Others interpret it as an expression of עִגוּן, anchoring, being unable to marry, but that cannot be, for if so, the “nun” should have been punctuated with a “dagesh” or it should have been spelled with two “nuns”.
<b>for the hand of the Lord has gone forth against me</b> Said Rabbi Levi: Wherever it says “the hand of the Lord,” it refers to a plague of pestilence, and the classic example is (Exod. 9:3): “Behold the hand of the Lord will be.”
@15
<b>Lo, your sister-in-law has returned</b> Heb. שָּׁבָה. In this word, the accent is above (on the first syllable) under the “shin,” because it is in the past tense, but [in the verse] (Esther 2:14): “and in the morning she would return (שָּׁבָה),” the accent is below (on the last syllable) on the “beth,” because it is the present tense, and so it is in all similar cases.
@16
<b>Do not entreat me</b> Heb. תִּפְגְעִי, do not urge me.
<b>for wherever you go, I will go</b> From here our Sages derived that a [prospective] proselyte who comes to convert is told some of the punishments [for violating the commandments], so that if he decides to renege, he can renege, for out of Ruth’s words, you learn what Naomi said to her: “We may not go out of the boundary [of 2,000 cubits on all sides] on the Sabbath.” She replied to her, “Wherever you go, I will go.” “We are prohibited to allow a female to be secluded with a male who is not her husband.” She replied, “Wherever you lodge, I will lodge.” “Our people is separated from the other peoples with 613 commandments.” [She replied,] “Your people is my people.” “Idolatry is forbidden to us.” “Your God is my God.” “Four types of death penalties were delegated to the beth din (court) [to punish transgressors].” “Wherever you die I will die.” “Two burial plots were delegated to the beth din [to bury those executed], one for those stoned and those burned, and one for those decapitated and those strangled.” She replied, “And there I will be buried.”
@17
<b>So may the Lord do to me</b> as He has commenced to harm [me], for His hand has gone forth against me to slay my husband and to cause me to lose my property.
<b>and so may He continue</b> if anything but death separates me from you.
@18
<b>so she stopped speaking to her</b> From here they derived that we do not overburden him and we are not overly meticulous with him (i.e., with a prospective convert).
@19
<b>And they both went on</b> Said Rabbi Abbahu: Come and see how dear the proselytes are to the Holy One, blessed be He: Since she decided to convert, Scripture compared her to Naomi.
<b>that the entire city was astir</b> The entire city became astir. They had gathered to bury Boaz’s wife, who had died on that very day.
<b>Is this Naomi?</b> Heb. הֲזאֹת. The “hey” is vowelized with a “hataf” because it is in the interrogative. Is this Naomi who used to go out in covered wagons and with mules? Have you seen what happened to her because she went out from the Holy Land?
@21
<b>I went away full</b> with wealth and sons. Another interpretation is that she was pregnant.
<b>has testified</b> Heb. עָנָה, has testified against me that I dealt wickedly before Him. Another explanation: The Divine Standard of Justice has humbled me, as (Hosea 5:5): “And the pride of Israel shall be humbled (וְעָנָה).”
@22
<b>at the beginning of the barley harvest</b> Scripture is speaking of the harvest of the Omer.

@1
<b>a kinsman</b> Heb. מוֹדַע, a kinsman. He was the son of Elimelech’s brother. Our Sages said: Elimelech and Salmon the father of Boaz and So-and-So the near kinsman were all sons of Nahshon the son of Amminadab, but the merit of their fathers did not avail them when they left the Land to go abroad.
@2
<b>I will go now to the field</b> To one of the fields of the people of the city, after one of them, in whose eyes I will find favor, that he will not rebuke me.
@3
<b>And she went, and she came, and she gleaned in the field</b> We find in Midrash Ruth [Rabbah]: Before she went she came; Scripture says: And she came, and she gleaned? But rather, she marked the roads before she entered the field, and she went and came and returned to the city, in order to make signs and markings so that she would not stray in the paths and know how to return.
<b>and her chance was</b> to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz.
@5
<b>To whom does this maiden belong?</b> Now was it Boaz’s habit to inquire about the women? But rather, he saw her modest and wise behavior. Two ears she would glean but three she would not glean; and she would glean the standing ears while standing and the lying ones while sitting, in order to avoid bending over.
@6
<b>who returned with Naomi</b> The accent is under the “shin” because it is the past tense, and not the present tense of the verb.
@7
<b>And she said</b> to herself.
<b>I will now glean</b> the gleaning of the ears.
<b>and gather from among the sheaves</b> the forgotten sheaves.
@9
<b>And [if] you are thirsty, you may go to the vessels</b> And if you are thirsty, do not be ashamed to go and drink from the vessels of water that the young men will draw.

@14
<b>and dip your morsel in the vinegar</b> From here [we derive] that vinegar is beneficial for a heatwave.
<b>and he handed her parched grain</b> Heb. וַיִצְבָּט, and he handed her. There is no similar word in the Bible, but in the language of the Mishnah (Hagigah 3:1): “the back, the interior, and the handle (בֵּית הַצְבִיטָה).”
@16
<b>And also, pretend to forget</b> Heb. שֹּׁל תָּשּׂלוּ, you shall forget, pretend that you are forgetting. The Targum for שְּׁגָגָה, inadvertence, is שָּׁלוּתָא, and similarly, (II Sam. 6:7): “for the error, (הַשַּׁל).” Another explanation: an expression of (Deut. 28:40): “your olive tree will cast off (יִשַּׁל) [its fruit].”
<b>bundles</b> Heb. צְבָתִים small sheaves, and there is a similar expression in the language of the Mishnah (Er. 10: 1): “If he found them (tefillin) in pairs (צְבָתִים) or in bundles.”

A person always calls his uncle his brother, as is stated (Gen. 14:14): “And Abram heard that his brother was captured.” Now was not Abraham his (Lot’s) uncle? Similarly, Boaz was Elimelech’s nephew, a kinsman of Mahlon, but Tov was closer.

To stop those who ascended from the exile during the days of Cyrus, who had commenced to build the Temple, and the Cutheans slandered them and stopped them, and when Cyrus died, and Ahasuerus reigned, and Haman was promoted, he feared that those in Jerusalem would engage in the construction, and they sent in the name of Ahasuerus to the princes of the other side of the river to stop them.

It [originally] contained three alphabetical acrostics (Lam. ch. 1): “O how...remained,” (ch. 2) “How...brought darkness,” (ch. 4) “How dim...has become,” and he added to it, (ch. 3) “I am the man,” which contains three alphabetical acrostics, as it is said (Jer. 36:32): “and there were yet added to them many words like those,” three corresponding to three.
<b>lonely</b> solitary, devoid of her inhabitants.
<b>populous</b> Heb. רַבָּתִי עָם, great of people. The “yud” is superfluous, like רַבַּת עָם, for her people were many. There are many Aggadic midrashim [on this verse], but I have come to explain the language of the Scripture according to its literal meaning.
<b>She has become like a widow</b> but not really a widow; rather, like a woman whose husband went abroad and intends to return to her.

<b>She weeps, yea, she weeps</b> weeping twice over the two destructions.
<b>in the night</b> for the Temple was burned at night, as the master said (Ta’an. 29a): “At eventide, they ignited the fire upon it.” Another explanation: because of the night—the night of the weeping of the Spies on the ninth of Av caused it to happen to them (Lam. Rabbah ms. 1:178, Targum, Sanh. 104b, Ta’an. 29a). Another explanation: in the night—for whoever weeps at night, the one who hears his voice weeps along with him (Lam. Rabbah 1:24, Sanh. ad loc.).
<b>and her tears are on her cheek</b> since she weeps constantly.
<b>all her friends</b> those who love her.

<b>Judah went into exile</b> from her land.
<b>and great servitude</b> with which the Chaldeans burdened her.
<b>she settled among the nations</b> and in the place where she was exiled and settled she found no rest.
<b>between the boundaries</b> where there is a high place on either side, and there is no place to flee.
<b>the boundaries</b> Heb. הַמְצָרִים, the boundaries of fields and vineyards. The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah 1:29) explains: between the seventeenth of Tammuz and the ninth of Av.
@4
<b>because no one comes to the appointed season</b> the pilgrims who went up for the festivals.
<b>her maidens grieve</b> Heb. נוּגוֹת, an expression of grief (יָגוֹן), and there is no radical but the “gimmel” alone.
@5
<b>are at ease</b> dwell in tranquility.
<b>has afflicted her</b> caused her grief, and this is an expression of grief.
@6
<b>like harts who did not find pasture</b> like harts who did not find pasture, who have no strength to flee, for their strength has been weakened by hunger.
<b>pursuer</b> Heb. רוֹדֵף. Every רֹדֵף in Scripture is defective (רֹדֵף), but this one is full (רוֹדֵף), for they were pursued with a full pursuit. Therefore the paytan composed “I was fully pursued, but the year of my redemption is missing, (גְאֻלַי).” (Isa. 63: 4): “The year of my redemption (גְאֻלַי) has arrived” is spelled defectively.
@7
<b>Jerusalem recalls</b> in her exile.
<b>the days of her poverty</b> the days of her destruction, which brought her to poverty.
<b>and her miseries</b> Heb. וּמְרוּדֶיהָ. This is an expression of pain, like (Jud. 11:37): “and I wailed (וְיָרַדְתִּי) upon the mountains”; (Ps. 55:3): “I lament (אָרִיד) in my speech, and I moan.”
<b>all her precious things</b> And she remembered all the good of her precious things that were from days of old.
<b>gloating on her desolation</b> Heb. מִשְּׁבַּתֶיהָ. They rejoiced over the cessation of her festivals, her New Moons, and her Sabbaths; and the Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah) interprets it as a different expression, that they rested in exile on the Sabbaths and festivals and observed the seventh year, and the heathens ridiculed them and said, “Fools! In your land you did not keep the Sabbatical Year, and now in exile you keep it? In your land, you did not keep the Sabbath, and now in exile you keep it?”
@8
<b>a wanderer</b> Heb. לְנִידָה, an exile, an expression of moving and wandering (נָע וָנָד), esmo(u) vement in Old French, that which moves on.
<b>her shame</b> Heb. עֶרְוָתָה, lit. her nakedness.
<b>she herself sighed</b> Heb. נֶאֶנְחָה is in the passive past tense, sospirer in Old French, to sigh, [a verb]. “They heard that I am sighing (נֶאֶנָחָה) (verse 21) is a noun, sospirose in Old French, one who sighs.
@9
<b>Her uncleanliness is in her skirts</b> This is an expression of disgrace. Her menstrual blood is visible in the skirts of her garments, i.e., her sins are conspicuous; she committed them flagrantly.
<b>she was not mindful of her end</b> When they would sin, they were not mindful of what their end would be. Therefore, “she fell astonishingly.” Her descent was astonishing, bringing about much bewilderment, for everyone was bewildered that this happened to her, something that did not happen to any other city.
@10
<b>The adversary stretched forth his hand</b> Ammon and Moab.
<b>upon all her precious things</b> the Siphrei Torah, which are spoken of as (Ps. 19: 11): “They are to he desired more than gold.” All turned to plunder silver and gold, and they turned upon the Siphrei Torah in order to burn them, because it is written in them, (Deut. 23:4): “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter, etc.”
<b>whom You did command not to enter into Your assembly</b> These are Ammon and Moab.
@12
<b>let it not happen to you</b> Such a calamity should no longer happen to all those who transgress the Law. Our Sages said (Sanh. 104b): It is derived from here that “kuvlana” has a basis in Scripture. See what He did to me; behold and see, etc.
<b>which has been dealt to me</b> which has been done to me.
<b>[with] which the Lord saddened</b> on the day of His fierce anger. This is an expression [denoting] grief, saddening.
@13
<b>and it broke them</b> Heb. וַיִרְדֶנָה, equivalent to וַיִרֶד אוֹתָה, and it broke it, [referring to each of his bones] through punishment and suffering. Therefore, the “nun” is punctuated with a “dagesh,” so that it is interpreted in the feminine singular, like יַעֲשֶׂנָה, he will do it; יְכַסְמֶנָה, he will gnaw at it; יִרְעֶנָה, will graze upon it; for עֶצֶם, bone, is in the feminine gender, as Scripture states (Ezek. 36:4): הָעֲצָמוֹת הַיְבֵשׁוֹת, the dry bones.” It broke each one. Another explanation: וַיִרְדֶנָה is like (Jud. 14:9): “and he separated it (וַיִרְדֵהוּ) into his hands.” It scrapes and separates the marrow from its midst.
@14
<b>The yoke of my transgressions was marked</b> Heb. נִשְׂקַד. This word has no likeness in Scripture, and in the Aramaic language of the Pesikta (d’Rav Kahana p. 153), they call a goad מַסְקְדָא, an ox goad, and I say that it is equivalent to pointurez in Old French. My transgressions were dotted, spotted, and marked in the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, for a remembrance. Their number and their recompense were not forgotten.
<b>they have become interwoven</b> Heb. יִשְּׂתָּרְגוּ. They became many plaits, and came up on my neck. This is the language of the Mishnah (See M.K. 1:8). We may not girth (מְסָרְגִין) the bedsteads.
@15
<b>The Lord has trampled</b> Heb. סִלָה. He trampled and trod, an expression of (Isa. 62:10): “pave, pave the highway (סֹלוּ סֹלוּ הַמְסִלָה),” [meaning to beat down the road].
<b>He summoned an assembly against me</b> Heb. מוֹעֵד, a gathering of troops to come against me. And our Sages expounded what they expounded (Pes. 77a, Ta’an. 29a, Sanh. 104b): Tammuz of that year was a full (thirty-day) month; [i. e., the Tammuz] of the second year from the Exodus from Egypt. Therefore, the return of the Spies occurred on the night of the ninth of Av, upon which their weeping was established for generations (Ta’an. ad loc., Sanh. ad loc., Sotah 35a).
<b>the Lord has trodden as in a wine press</b> An expression of massacre, like (Isa. 63:3): “A wine press I trod alone.” As one treads grapes to extract their wine, so did He trample the women to extract their blood.
@16
<b>my eye, yea, my eye</b> i.e., my eye constantly sheds tears. The double expression indicates that there was no letup.
@17
<b>Zion spreads out her hands</b> Heb. פֵּרְשָּׂה. Like (Isa. 25:11): “And he shall spread out (וּפֵרַשּׂ) his hands in his midst,” like a person who moves his hands to and fro and demonstrates his pain with them. Another explanation is: Zion broke, an expression of breaking, like (Lam. 4:4): “no one breaks it for them”; (Jer. 16:7): “and they shall not break [bread] (יִפְרְסוּ) for them in mourning,” to console him for his dead [kinsman]. So did Menachem classify it (Machbereth Menachem p. 146). And in the language of the Mishnah (Ber. 37a), the broken piece of bread (פְּרוּסָה) is intact. And it means that Zion was in pain like a person who clasps his hands and breaks them. I found an addendum.
<b>the Lord has commanded concerning Jacob that his adversaries shall be round about him</b> He commanded concerning Jacob that his adversaries would surround him. Even when they were exiled to Babylon and to Assyria, Sennacherib exiled their enemies, Ammon and Moab, and settled them beside them, and they taunted them, as is stated in Tractate Kiddushin (72a): Humania was in Babylon, entirely occupied by Ammonites.
<b>an outcast</b> Heb. לְנִדָה, for an outcast and a disgrace.
@19
<b>I called to my lovers</b> Heb. לַמְאַהֲבַי, to those who make themselves appear as lovers.
<b>[but] they deceived me</b> e.g., the children of Ishmael, who went forth toward the exiles when the captors were leading them on the road nearby, as if they were compassionate toward them. And they brought them various kinds of salty foods and inflated skin flasks. They [the Jews] thought that these were [flasks of] wine, so they ate and became thirsty and wished to drink, and when they untied the flask with their teeth, the air entered their intestines and they died. This is what Scripture says (Isa. 21:13f.): “In the forest in Arabia you shall lodge, etc. Bring water toward the thirsty! The inhabitants of the land of Tema came before the wanderer with bread.”
<b>to revive their souls</b> so that they should revive their souls.
@20
<b>burn</b> Heb. חֳמַרְמָרוּ, they became shriveled, and there is an expression like this in the language of the Mishnah (Hul. 3:3): “It fell into the fire and its intestines were scorched (וְנֶחְמְרוּ).”
<b>in the house it is like death</b> Within the house was fear of demons and destructive beings and angels of death, and from without, the enemy’s sword was bereaving them.
@21
<b>that You have done it</b> You caused them to hate me when You separated me from their food and from their drink and from intermarrying with them. Had I intermarried with them, they would have had compassion upon me and upon their daughters’ sons.
<b>You had brought the day that You proclaimed</b> If only You had brought upon them the appointed day that You proclaimed upon me.
<b>and let them be like me</b> in distress.
@22
<b>May all their wickedness come before You</b> May all their iniquities be remembered and counted before You.
<b>and deal with them</b> Heb. וְעוֹלֵל, and do, like (Prov. 20:11): “Also a child can disguise himself with his deeds (בְּמַעֲלָלָיו)”; (Jer. 32:19): “and in accordance with the fruit of his deeds (מַעֲלָלָיו).”

@1
<b>brought darkness</b> Heb. יָעִיב, brought darkness, as Scripture states (I Kings 18:45): “the heavens grew dark with clouds (בְּעָבִים).”
<b>from heaven to earth</b> After He lifted them up to heaven, He cast them to earth all at once, and not little by little, [as] from a lofty roof to a deep pit.
<b>His footstool</b> that is the Temple.
@2
<b>the habitations of Jacob</b> Heb. נְאוֹת, the houses of Jacob, an expression of נָוֶה, a dwelling.
<b>He has struck [them] to the ground</b> He humbled them to the ground.
<b>He has profaned the kingdom and its princes</b> These are the Israelites, who were called (Exod. 19:6): “a kingdom of priests.”
<b>and its princes</b> There is a Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah 2:5) [that states that] these are the heavenly princes [whose assignments] He changed. The one appointed over fire He appointed over water, and He changed all the appointees because there were among the wicked of Israel those who knew the Ineffable Name, and they relied [upon the fact] that they could adjure the heavenly princes to save them from fire, from water and from the sword. Now, when he would adjure the prince of fire by his name, he would reply, “This dominion is not in my hands,” and similarly, all of them.
@3
<b>He has withdrawn His right hand</b> He withdrew Himself as though withdrawing His right hand from waging war on behalf of His children.
@4
<b>He has bent His bow</b> Heb. דרך lit. trod. Since this is the procedure of those who bend the bow, who are strong, to place their foot upon them when he bends them; it is therefore worded as an expression of treading.
<b>He has poured out His fury like fire</b> The arrangement of the words is as follows: He poured out His anger, which is like fire, for we do not find pouring of fire, except in conjunction with anger, as it is written (Ps. 79:6): “Pour out Your wrath upon the nations.”
@5
<b>and He increased in the daughter of Judah</b> He increased in the congregation of Judah.
<b>pain and wailing</b> Heb. תַּאֲנִיָה וַאֲנִיָה, pain and wailing.
<b>and He increased</b> Heb. וַיֶרֶב. The “yud” is vowelized with a small “pattah” (seggol), which is an expression of increasing others. (Exod. 1:20): “and the people multiplied (וַיִרֶב) and became very strong,” is vowelized with a “hirik”, which is an expression meaning that he himself increased, and so every word whose radical ends with a “hey,” e.g. פנה, to turn, זנה to go astray, בכה, to weep, are vowelized in that manner when the “hey” is missing, when it speaks of itself [i.e., the simple (קַל) conjugation, not the causative], e.g. (Exod. 7:23): “And Pharaoh turned (וַיִפֶן).” But when he speaks of others [i.e, the causative conjugation (הפעיל)], it is vowelized with a small “pattah” (seggol), e.g. (Jud. 15:4): “and he turned (וַיֶפֶן) tail to tail”; (II Kings 25: 21): “And Judah went into exile (וַיִגֶל) from his land”; (ibid. 18:11): “and the king of Babylon (sic) exiled (וַיֶגֶל) Israel to Assyria.”
@6
<b>He stripped</b> Heb. וַיַחְמֹס, an expression of cutting, and so (Job 15:33): “He will cast off (יַחְמֹס) like a vine”; (Jer. 13:22): “your steps were cut off (נֶחְמְסוּ).”
<b>like a garden</b> as they cut off the vegetables of a garden.
<b>His Tabernacle</b> Heb. שֻׂכּוֹ, His habitation. It is written שֻׂכּוֹ [with a “sin” rather than with a “sammech”, intimating] that He assuaged (שִּׁכֵּךְ) His anger against His children with the destruction of His House. Thus it is interpreted in the Midrash of Lamentations (Lam. Rabbah).
<b>and laid in ruins His Meeting Place</b> The Holy of Holies, where He would meet with His children, as it is said (Exod. 25:22): “And I will meet (וְנוֹעַדְתִּי) you there.”
<b>king and priest</b> King Zedekiah and Seraiah the High Priest.
@7
<b>He has abolished</b> Heb. נִאֵר, and so, (Ps. 89:40): “You abrogated (נֵאַרְתָּה) the covenant of Your servant.”
<b>as on a day of a festival</b> For they were making merry and singing in its midst with a loud voice. So did the enemies let out a cry of joy when it was destroyed.
@8
<b>The Lord determined to destroy</b> It is already many days since this entered His mind, as it is written (Jer. 32:31): “For this city has aroused My anger and My wrath until this day, to remove it from before My face.”
<b>He stretched out a line</b> of judgment to be punished for our iniquities.
<b>rampart and wall</b> a large wall and a small wall, a low wall opposite a high wall.
@9
<b>Her gates are sunk into the ground</b> The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah) states: Because they imparted honor to the Ark, as it is said (Ps. 24:9): “[You] gates, lift up your heads.” Therefore, no one had any power over them, and they sank into the ground (Lam. Rabbah). Our Sages (Sotah 9a) said that they were David’s handiwork; therefore, the enemies did not have any power over them.
<b>there is no more teaching</b> There is no one among them who gives instruction.
@10
<b>sit on the ground, etc.</b> [This is to be understood] according to its apparent meaning. But the Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah) states: Nebuchadnezzar caused them to sit on the ground when Zedekiah rebelled against him and transgressed his oath. He came and stationed himself in Daphne of Antioch, and sent for the Sanhedrin, and they came toward him. He recognized that they were men of imposing appearance and sat them down in golden chairs. He said to them, “Recite your Torah for me chapter by chapter and translate it for me.” As soon as they reached the chapter dealing with vows, he said to them, “What if he wishes to retract, can he retract?” They said to him, “Let him go to a sage, and he will absolve him of it.” He said to them, “If so, you absolved Zedekiah of his oath.” He gave the order, and they pushed them off [their seats] and sat them on the ground. They then tied the hair of their heads to the tails of horses and dragged them.
@11
<b>my innards burn</b> Heb. חֳמַרְמְרוּ, regrizi(l)lerent in Old French, have shriveled up. It is usual that when a person casts intestines into the fire, they shrivel up and burn.

@13
<b>What shall I testify for you? What shall I compare to you</b> to say to you, “Why do you wonder about your destruction? Didn’t that also happen to such and such a nation, just like you?”
<b>What can I liken to you, that I may comfort you</b> When trouble befalls a person, [others] say to him, “This also happened to so-and-so.” These are consolations for him.
@14
<b>false and senseless visions</b> words that have no taste, and in Old French aflestrimant, insipidity, sickliness.
<b>and they have not exposed your iniquity</b> to reprove you to your face about your way.
<b>to straighten out your backsliding</b> Heb. לְהָשִּׁיב שְׁבוּתֵךְ, an expression of (Jer. 8:5) שּׁוֹבְבָה (ibid. 3:14) שּׁוֹבְבִים, backsliding; (Isa. 57:17): “and he went rebelliously (שּׁוֹבָב).”
<b>misleading oracles</b> They misled you away from Me.
@15
<b>they hissed</b> To blow with the mouth, siblir in Old French, to hiss, whistle. It is customary for a person to do this when he sees an important thing that was ruined.
<b>the perfection of beauty</b> All beauty was hers.
@16
<b>All your enemies have opened their mouths wide against you</b> Why did Scripture place the “pey” before the “ayin”? Because they were saying with their mouths (פֶּה) what they did not see with their eyes (עַיִן).
@17
<b>He has carried out His word</b> He completed His decree, like (Job 6:9): “let loose His hand and finish me off (וִיבַצְעֵנִי).”
<b>which He decreed long ago</b> that which is written in the Torah (Lev. 26: 18): “and I shall continue to chastise you sevenfold.”
@18
<b>respite</b> Heb. פוּגַת, an expression of letting up, tresalemant in Old French, respite, let up, like (Gen. 45:26): “and his heart grew faint (וַיָפָג).”
<b>the pupil of your eye</b> the black area of the eye, which is called prunelle in French, pupil.
@19
<b>at the beginning of the watches</b> [i.e., at the beginning of the final] two parts of the night, for the night is divided into three parts, as our Rabbis stated in Tractate Berachoth (3).
<b>who faint</b> pגmיs in French, faint, swooning.
@20
<b>children that are petted</b> tender children, who are still being raised with their mothers’ pampering. And our Sages expounded on Doeg the son of Joseph, whose mother would measure him with [her] fists every day, to give gold to the Temple according to how much he grew, and she ultimately devoured him.
<b>Will priest and prophet be slain in the Sanctuary of the Lord</b> The holy spirit answers them, “Now was it proper for you that you slew Zechariah the son of Jehoiada?” as is written in (II) Chronicles (24:22), that he reproved them when they came and prostrated themselves to Joash, and deified him. (ibid. verse 20): “And the spirit of God enveloped Zechariah the son of Jehoiada.” He was a priest and a prophet, and they slew him in the forecourt.
@22
<b>You have summoned...as though it were a feast day</b> Heb. תִּקְרָא, like קָרָאתָ, and this is the present tense.
<b>my neighbors</b> my evil neighbors, to gather about me to destroy.

@1
<b>I am the man who has seen affliction</b> Jeremiah lamented, saying, “I am the man who has seen affliction,” who has seen affliction more than all the prophets who prophesied concerning the destruction of the Temple, for the Temple was not destroyed in their days, but it was in my days.
<b>by the rod of His wrath</b> of the One who chastises and smites, i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He.
@3
<b>Only against me would He repeatedly</b> I alone am constantly smitten, for the entire repetition of His blows is upon me.
@4
<b>He has made my flesh and my skin waste away</b> Heb. בִּלָה, like (Isa. 44:19): “to rotten wood (לְבוּל עֵץ).” Another explanation: He has made my flesh and my skin waste away, like (ibid. 51:6): “And the earth shall rot away (תִּבְלֶה) like a garment,” i.e., both young and old lay on the ground with neither pillow nor cushion, and their flesh wore out when they were going into exile.
@5
<b>and encompassed</b> He encompassed me.
<b>gall</b> Heb. רֹאשּׁ, like (Deut. 29: “gall (רֹאשּׁ) and wormwood.” The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabhah), states: רֹאשּׁ refers to Nebuchadnezzar in the exile of Jehoiachin.
<b>travail</b> Nebuzaradan, who completed the blow in the days of Zedekiah, and he wearied me.
@7

<b>so that I cannot get out</b> He stationed camps and troops of soldiers lying-in-wait around me.
<b>He has made my chains heavy</b> He made heavy fetters for my feet so that I would be unable to walk, f(i)eryes in Old French, chains.
@8
<b>He shuts out my prayer</b> He shut the windows of the sky before it.
@9
<b>He has made my paths crooked</b> If I wish to go out, I do not go out on roads paved in a straight way, because of the enemies, but I go out on a crooked road.
@10
<b>He is to me a bear lying in wait</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, turned into a bear lying in wait for me.
@11
<b>He scattered thorns on my ways</b> Heb. סוֹרֵר, an expression of סִירִים, thorns. סוֹרֵר means that He “thorned” them, He scattered thorns on my ways.
<b>He caused me to spread my legs</b> Heb. וַיְפַשְׁחֵנִי, an expression of spreading the legs. One who passes on roads that are not cleared must widen his stride, and there is an example of this in the language of the Gemara (M.K. 10b): “The one who pruned (דְפָשַׁח) a date palm” [meaning that he separated the branches from the trunk].
@12
<b>and set me up as a target</b> He set me up opposite His arrows to shoot at me like a target, asenayl in Old French, target.
@13
<b>the arrows of His quiver</b> arrows that are placed within the quiver, called cuyvre, quiver.
@16
<b>He has made...grind</b> Heb. וַיַגְרֵס, and He broke, and an example is (Ps. 119.20): “My soul is crushed (גָרְסָה)”; and similarly (Lev. 2:14): “ground (גֶרֶשּׂ) when still fresh.”
<b>on gravel</b> Heb. בֶּחָצָץ, fine pebbles that are in the midst of the dust, for the exiles would knead their dough in the pits that they would dig in the ground, and the gravel would enter it, as the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Ezekiel (12:3), “Make yourself implements for exile,” in which to drink and in which to knead a small cake, so that they should learn and do likewise, as it is stated (ibid. 24:24): “And Ezekiel will be to you for a sign,” but they ridiculed him and did not do so; [so] their teeth were ultimately broken.
<b>and caused me to wallow</b> He turned me over in ashes like a vessel inverted on its mouth, adenter in Old French, to throw flat on one’s face. There is a similar word in the Mishnah (sic) (Yev. 107b): Pishon the camel driver measured with an inverted (כְּפוּשָּׁה) measure.
@18
<b>So I said, Gone is my life</b> Heb. נִצְחִי. I said to myself in the midst of my many troubles, “My world and my hope are gone.”
@19
<b>and my misery</b> Heb. וּמְרוּדִי, compleynt, wailing.
@20
<b>well remembers</b> My soul [well remembers] my affliction and my misery and is bowed down within me. This is the simple meaning according to the context of the verse. The Midrash Aggadah (Lam. Rabbah), however, [explains it as follows:] I know that You will ultimately remember what was done to me, but my soul is bowed down within me waiting for the time of remembrance. On this the liturgical poet based [his poem]: “With this I know that You have to remember, but my soul is bowed down within me until You remember.”
@21
<b>This I reply to my heart</b> After my heart said to me that my hope from the Lord was gone, I will reply this to my heart, and I will continue to hope. Now what is it that I will reply to my heart?
@22
<b>Verily, the kindnesses of the Lord never cease</b> and the entire section until (v. 39): “Why should [a living man] complain? etc.”
<b>Indeed, His mercies never fail</b> Heb. כִּי לא תָמְנוּ, like כִּי לֹא תָמוּ. And some explain: כִּי לֹא תָמְנוּ, [for we have not ended] like (Num. 17:27): “Are we then altogether given (תָמְנוּ) to die?” It is [because of] the kindnesses of the Lord that we have not ended, that we have not perished because of our iniquities.
@23
<b>They are new every morning</b> Your kindnesses are renewed from day to day.
<b>great is Your faithfulness</b> Your promise is great, and it is a great thing to believe in You that You will fulfill and keep what You promised us.
@24
<b>“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul</b> The Lord is my portion; it is therefore proper that I should hope in Him.
@26
<b>It is good that one should wait quietly</b> Heb. טוֹב וְיָחִיל וְדוּמָם. The “vav” of וְיָחִיל is superfluous like the “vav” of (Gen. 36:24): “Ayyah (וְאַיָּה) and Anah.” It is good that a man wait and remain silent and hope for the Lord’s salvation.
@28
<b>Let him sit solitary</b> Whoever was befallen by mourning and trouble should sit solitary and hope for the best.
<b>and wait</b> Heb. וְיִדֹם, an expression of waiting, like (I Sam. 14:9): “If they say thus to us, Wait! (דֹמוּ)” about Jonathan.
<b>for He has laid [it] upon him</b> for the Lord of decrees has laid this decree upon him.
@31
<b>For the Lord will not cast [him] off forever</b> It is therefore good to wait.
@32
<b>Though he cause grief</b> If a man brings grief upon himself because of his iniquity, afterwards—He will yet have compassion according to the abundance of His kindness. The words הוֹגָה וְיָגֶה are expressions of תּוּגָה, grief.
@33
<b>For He does not willingly afflict or grieve the sons of man</b> from His heart and from His will, but the iniquity causes [it].
@34
<b>[Or] crush under His feet</b> This refers back to, “For He does not willingly afflict to crush under His feet, etc., or pervert the righteous judgment of a man, or distort a man’s dispute, etc.” All these the Lord did not approve. He did not approve of them, and it did not enter His thoughts to do so.
@36

<b>[And] by the command of the Most High, etc.</b> And if you attempt to say that this evil did not come to me from His hand, that it is happenstance that it has befallen me, this is not so, for both evil occurrences and good occurrences—who has commanded and they came to pass, unless the Lord ordained? And by His command both evil and good come. But “why should a living man complain? A man for his sins.” Every man should complain about his sins, because they are what bring the evil upon him. (
<b>By the command of the Most High, neither good nor evil come</b> Said Rabbi Johanan: Since the day that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, [Deut. 30:15]: “See, I have set before you today life and good, etc.,” neither evil nor good has come from His command, but the evil comes by itself to the one who commits evil and the good to the one who does good. [Lam. Rabbah].) Therefore, what should a man complain about, if not about his sins?

<b>Let us lift up our hearts to our hands</b> When we lift up our hands to heaven, let us also lift up our hearts with them, to return, to bring back our hearts before the Omnipresent, blessed be He. (Lam. Rabbah ms.). Another explanation:

But he who explains it as an expression of grief (תּוּגָה וְיָגוֹן) is in error, for there is no “nun” in this word, for the “nun” in יָגוֹן is not a radical, but is like the “nun” of הָמוֹן from the root of הָמוּ גוֹיִם and like קָלוֹן from the root of נִקְלֶה, and like the “nun” of צִיוֹן from the root of צִיָה and so the “nun” of שִּׁבְרוֹן from the root of שֶּׁבֶר (and like the “nun” of שִּׁגָעוֹן, שְּׁמָמוֹן. It appears to me that this is the correct reading, and this is easy to understand.)

The Holy One, blessed be He, signaled to the sea and caused inflated flasks like human intestines to float before them, moving around in the water.

<b>We have stretched out</b> Heb. נָתַנוּ, like נָתַנְנוּ. The dagesh in the “nun” takes the place of the second “nun,” and so (I Chron. 29:14): “For all is from You, and from Your hand we have given it (נָתַנוּ) to You”; and so (Gen. 34:16): “and we will give (וְנָתַנוּ) our daughters to you.”

<b>The words of Koheleth</b> Wherever it says, “the words of,” it refers to words of reproof. (Deut. 1: 1): “These are the words that Moses spoke”... (ibid. 32:15): “And Jeshurun became fat.” (Amos 1: 1): “The words of Amos”... (ibid. 4:1): “Hearken to this word, O cows of Bashan.” (Jer. 1:1): “The words of Jeremiah”... (ibid. 30:6): “Ask now and see whether a male gives birth, etc.” (II Sam. 23: 1): “And these are the words of David”... (verse 6): “But the wicked are all as thorns thrust away.” “The words of Koheleth...The sun rises...All the rivers run into the sea.” He refers to the wicked as the sun, the moon, and the sea, which have no reward. So it was taught in Sifrei (Deut. 1:1). I learned from there that the section deals with the wicked and compares them to the rising of the sun, which ultimately sets. Addendum: Another explanation: All the rivers run into the sea. What is the meaning of this? This is stated concerning idolaters, the fools who prostrate themselves to the water and think that it has substance since they see the Great Sea, into which all the rivers run, and it is not full, but they do not know that to the place where the rivers flow, they repeatedly go, for the water of the rivers that flow into the sea is the very same water that already flowed. They flow from under the deep and go above the ground until the sea and repeatedly flow. Therefore, the rivers do not stop, and the sea does not become full, and not because they have substance. End of addendum.
<b>Koheleth</b> Because he gathered (קִהֵל) many wisdoms, and similarly, elsewhere (Prov. 30:1) Scripture calls him Agur the son of Jakeh, because he gathered (אָגַר) all the wisdom and vomited it (וְהִקִיאָה), and some say that he would say all his words in an assembly (בְּהַקְהֵל).

<b>Vanity of vanities, said Koheleth</b> Koheleth complains about the creation of the seven days of Creation, that all is vanity of vanities.

<b>A generation goes and a generation comes</b> As much as the wicked man toils and labors to oppress and to rob, he does not outlive his works, for the generation goes and another generation comes and takes all away from his sons, as it is stated (Job 20:10): “His sons will placate the poor.”
<b>but the earth endures forever</b> But who are the ones who endure? The humble and low, who bring themselves down to the earth, as it is stated (Ps. 37:11): “But the humble shall inherit the earth.” And Midrash Tanhuma states: All the righteous of Israel are called earth [or land], as it is said (Mal. 3:12): “for you shall be a desirable land.”

In Tammuz it goes through them, and in Teveth it goes around them. Also the wicked, no matter how much their sun rises, they will ultimately set. No matter how much they gain power, they will ultimately return to the place of filth. From the place of filth they came, and to the place of filth they will go. And so...
@7
<b>All the rivers flow into the sea</b> because they do not remain therein, for the ocean is higher than the entire world, as it is said (Amos 5:8): “He calls the water of the sea and pours it, etc.” Now from where does a person pour? From above downward, and the rivers flow in the tunnels under the mountains from the ocean and repeatedly flow, and this is the meaning of: “to the place where the rivers flow, there they repeatedly go.” Also, the wicked man, (below 5:15) “just as it came, so shall it go.”

<b>All things are wearisome...the eye shall not be sated from seeing, nor shall the ear be filled</b> This refers back to, “What profit [has man]” if he exchanges the study of Torah to speak wasteful words?

<b>What has been is what will be, etc.</b> In whatever he learns, in a matter that is an exchange for the sun, there is nothing new. He will see only that which already was, which was created in the six days of Creation. But one who meditates on the Torah constantly finds new insights therein, as it is stated (Prov. 5:19): “her breasts will satisfy you at all times.” Just as this breast, whenever the infant feels it, he finds a taste in it, so are the words of Torah (Er. 54b), and so we find in Tractate Hagigah, that Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus said things that the ear had never heard, concerning the account of the Celestial Chariot.

@11
<b>neither will the later ones that will be</b> after us have any remembrance in the generations that will be after them.

<b>a sore task</b> Heb. עִנְיַן רַע. They have evil behavior.
<b>with which to occupy themselves</b> Heb. לַעֲנוֹת בּוֹ, to behave with it. עִנְיַן may be interpreted as an expression of an abode (מָעוֹן) and a dwelling, and it may also be interpreted as an expression of study (עִיוּן) and thought, and the same is true of לַעֲנוֹת בּוֹ.

@15
<b>What is crooked</b> during his lifetime, will not be able to be straightened after he dies. Whoever toiled on the eve of the Sabbath will eat on the Sabbath, and our Sages explained this as referring to one who was intimate with a woman forbidden to him and begot a mamzer, or to a Torah scholar who parted with the Torah, who was originally straight and became crooked.

<b>and folly</b> foolishness.
<b>I know</b> now that also wisdom has frustration in it, for in great wisdom, a person relies on his great wisdom and does not distance himself from prohibition, and much vexation comes to the Holy One, blessed be He. I said, “I will acquire many horses, but I will not return the people to Egypt,” but ultimately, I returned [them]. I said, “I will take many wives, but they will not turn my heart away,” but it is written about me, (I Kings 11:4): “his wives turned away his heart.” And so he says, (Prov. 30:1): “The words of the man concerning, ‘God is with me’; yea, God is with me, and I will be able.”

<b>and this was my portion</b> And after doing all these, I have nothing [left] of all of them but this. Rav and Shmuel [differ]: One says, his staff, and one says, his cup. קִידוֹ is an earthenware cup, from which [people] drink (Gittin 68b). Others in the Midrash Aggadah (Ecc. Zuta 2:8) interpret the entire section as referring to study halls, students, and synagogues [as follows]:

<b>Then I turned</b> now in all my deeds, and I see that there is no profit in them, for from all of them I am lacking.
@12
<b>And I turned to see wisdom</b> I turn from all my affairs to ponder over the Torah and madness and folly, [meaning] the punishment for transgressions.
<b>for what is the man who will come after the king</b> to supplicate him concerning a decree that they decreed upon him, and they already executed the decree. It is better for him to ponder at first upon his deeds, and he will find it unnecessary to beg.
@13

@14
<b>The wise man has eyes in its beginning</b> In the beginning of the matter, he observes what will be at its end.
<b>and I too know</b> Also, I, who praise the wise man over the fool, know that they both will die.
@15
<b>And I said to myself, etc.</b> i.e., since they will both die, perhaps I will think in my heart from now on that as it happens to the wicked man, so will it happen to me. So why should I be more righteous?
<b>And I said to myself</b> that if I think so, that is vanity, for the remembrances of the wise man and the fool are not equal. After their deaths, both of them will not be remembered together, for this one will be remembered for good, and this one will be remembered for evil.
@16
<b>for seeing that in the coming days all is forgotten</b> Because I see the wicked who already lived, and who were very successful, and in the days that came after them, all their heroism and their success were forgotten.
<b>And how shall the wise die with the fool</b> I see the righteous prospering in their deaths and availing their children, for example (Lev. 26:42): “And I shall remember My covenant with Jacob, etc.”; (Jer. 2:2): “I remember for you the love of your youth.”

@21
<b>For there is a man</b> Its apparent interpretation is according to its simple meaning, but the Midrash Aggadah in Tanhuma (Buber, vol. 1, p. 24) interprets it as an expression referring to the Holy One, blessed be He, concerning Whom it is said (Ezek. 1:26): “and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness like the appearance of a man.”
<b>whose toil is with wisdom</b> as it is said (Prov. 3:19f): “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom...With His knowledge the depths were split,” and to the creatures who did not toil in it, He gave a share in it.
<b>this too is vanity and a great evil</b> And they became a generation of vanity and the evil of man became great on the earth in the Generation of the Flood.

<b>For what has, etc.</b> For what profit has a man in all his toil and the breaking of his heart with toil and worry, which he toils, and leaves for others.
@23

<b>this too</b> is one of the vanities that prevail in the world.
@24
<b>Is it not good for a man</b> This is a question. [Is it not good for a man] that he eat and drink and show himself enjoyment? That is, let him pay heed to performing justice and righteousness with the eating and the drinking, and so it was said to Jehoiakim (Jer. 22:15): “Your father—did he not eat and drink and perform justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.”
@25
<b>For who will eat, etc.</b> Why shall I not rejoice with my portion in eating and drinking? Who is fit to eat what I toiled for, and who will hasten to swallow it, except me?
<b>except me</b> lit. outside of me. This is the trait of the wicked, who gather for others [i.e., they gather wealth that will ultimately go to others.
@26
<b>For to a man who is good in His sight</b> in the sight of God, mentioned above, “that it is from the hand of God.”
<b>He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy</b> a heart to engage in the Torah and in the commandments and to rejoice in his portion of eating, drinking, and clean clothing.
<b>but to the sinner He has given an occupation</b> a habit and a concern to gather and to accumulate, and to give to him who is good in God’s sight, as it is stated (Esther 8:2): “and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of the house of Haman.”
<b>this too</b> is one of the vanities that were given to the creatures, that they toil, and someone else takes [the fruits].

<b>everything beautiful in its time</b> At the time of good, it is beautiful that the reward be given for good deeds, and at the time of evil, it is fitting for the recompense for evil deeds.
<b>also the world He put in their hearts, etc.</b> Also the wisdom of the world that He put into the hearts of the creatures—He did not put it all into the heart of everyone, but [He gave] a little to this one and a little to that one, in order that man should not comprehend the entire deed of the Holy One, blessed be He, to know it; and he will not know the day of his visitation [i.e., the day of his death] and on what he will stumble, in order that he put his heart to repent, so that he will be concerned and say, “Today or tomorrow I will die.” Therefore, הָעֹלָם is written here defectively, an expression of concealment (הַעֲלָמָה), for if man would know that the day of his death was near, he would neither build a house nor plant a vineyard. Therefore, he says that He made everything beautiful in its time. The fact that there is a time for death is a beautiful thing, for a person relies and says, “Perhaps the time of my death is far off,” and he builds a house and plants a vineyard, and it is [therefore] beautiful that it is concealed from people.
@12

@14
<b>I knew that everything that God made</b> [i.e.,] that the Holy One, blessed be He, [made] in the Creation, is fit to exist forever, and it cannot be changed, either by adding or by diminishing, and when it is changed, God commanded and caused it to be changed, in order that they should fear Him. The ocean broke through its boundary in the generation of Enosh and inundated a third of the world, and God did this so that they would fear Him. For seven days, the course of the sun was changed in the Generation of the Flood, to rise in the west and set in the east, in order that they fear Him. The sun went back ten steps in the days of Hezekiah, and in the days of Ahaz his father, the day was shortened and the night was lengthened on the day of his death, so that he should not be eulogized. All this was so that they would fear Him. Therefore, there is nothing better for a man to occupy himself with than with His commandments and to fear Him.
@15
<b>That which was is already</b> That which was before us, was already done, and we saw it or heard it from others who saw it, and we can attest to it, for we saw that the Holy One, blessed be He, seeks the pursued. Jacob was pursued, [and] Esau was a pursuer, (Mal. 1:2f): “And I loved Jacob. And I hated Esau.” The Egyptians pursued Israel. The Egyptians drowned in the sea, and Israel went forth with a high hand.
<b>and that which</b> is destined to be at the end is a model of what already was. As it was in the beginning, so will it be at the end. The Holy One, blessed be He, does not change His standards in the world.
<b>and God seeks the pursued</b> to punish the pursuer. Therefore, what is the profit of one who does evil in what he toils? He is destined to he called to account.
@16
<b>the place of justice, etc.</b> I saw with the holy spirit the place of the Chamber of Hewn Stone in Jerusalem, which was (Isa. 1:21): “full of justice”; there they will judge wickedly, as it is said (Micah 3:11): “Its heads judge for bribes,” and I saw their punishment.
<b>and the place of righteousness</b> the middle gate, which was the place of deciding the laws.
<b>there is wickedness</b> there sat Sarsachim, Rab- Saris, Nergal-Sarezer, Rab-Mag (Jer. 39:3), and Nebuchadnezzar and his hosts, and they judged Israel with harsh tortures and death sentences.
<b>there is wickedness</b> Heb. הָרָשַׁע. The accent mark is before the last syllable, indicating that it is a noun like הָרֶשַּׁע, but since it is the end of the verse, it is changed to be vowelized with a “kamatz,” although we do not find another instance of this word that changes in the case of an ethnachta or a sof pasuk.
@17
<b>I said to myself, etc.</b> Therefore, I say: The Holy One, blessed be He, judges everyone after a time, and even though the matter is delayed, it will ultimately reach its time, for there is a time for every matter, even for retribution, and there is a time for the visitation of judgment.
<b>and for every deed</b> that man did, they will judge him there when the time of the visitation arrives; there at that time, a time is given for every deed, to be judged for it. [The Rabbis say:] At the gate of the fold there are words (of bargaining), but in the stall (where the sheep are delivered) there is strict accounting (Shab. 32a).
@18
<b>I said to myself</b> when I saw all this.
<b>[that this is] because of the children of men</b> who adopted the trait of haughtiness, to exert rulership and superiority over those smaller than they.
<b>[so that God] should clarify for them</b> The Holy One, blessed be He [judges them], to let them know that their rulership is naught, and to show them and also the princes and the kings.
<b>that they are like beasts to themselves</b> like other cattle and beasts they are to themselves.
@19
<b>For the happening of the children of men, etc.</b> This is the reason for the matter, that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave a fate and a mishap to the children of men, and there is a fate and a mishap to the beasts, and He gave one fate to them both, for just as this one dies, so does that one die.
<b>and the superiority of man over beast</b> And the superiority and success of man over the beasts is not apparent after he dies, for everything is converted to become vanity, to return to the dust.
@21
<b>Who knows</b> Like (Joel 2:14): “Whoever knows shall repent.” Who is it who understands and puts his heart to [the fact] that the spirit of the children of men ascends above and stands in judgment, and the spirit of the beast descends below to the earth, and does not have to give an accounting. Therefore, one must not behave like a beast, which does not care about its deeds.
@22
<b>And I saw</b> in all of these.
<b>that there is nothing better</b> for man.
<b>than that man rejoice in his deeds</b> in the toil of his hands he should rejoice and eat, but not to widen his desire like the grave, to covet riches, to accumulate that which is not his.
<b>for that is his portion</b> The toil of his hands—that is his portion given him from Heaven, and with it he will rejoice.
<b>for who will bring him to see</b> after he dies, what his sons will have; if they too will prosper with the riches that he gathered and left over for them or whether they will not prosper.

Ps. 84:3). And this verse too is expounded in this manner in Sifrei (Deut. 11:26).

@5
<b>The fool</b> The wicked man folds his hands and does not toil, and he does not eat except from robbery.

<b>There is one, and there is no second</b> There is a man who does his work alone.
<b>yea, he has neither son nor brother</b> If he is a Torah scholar, he does not acquire for himself a disciple, who is like a son, or a companion, who is like a brother. And if he is a bachelor, he does not take a wife, to be to him like a brother, and to beget a son. And if he is a merchant, he does not acquire partners for himself, but he goes out on the way alone.
<b>and there is no end to all his toil</b> He toils in study, and if he is a merchant, he toils with merchandise.
<b>neither is his eye sated from wealth</b> He will not be sated from the insights of Torah, for a person learns much Torah from his pupils, and regarding money, he constantly pursues money.
<b>Now for whom do I toil</b> since I do not raise disciples, and I do not take a wife to beget children?
@9
<b>Two are better</b> in all respects.
<b>than one</b> Therefore, a person should acquire for himself a companion and take his wife, for they have more profit in their toil. Much work is done by two, which the individual does not begin alone.
@10
<b>For if they fall</b> [To be explained] according to its apparent meaning. And regarding studies, if his studies were too difficult for him, his companion will restore them to him, or if he stumbles and was not exact in what he heard from his mentor, his companion will set him on the truthful course.

@12
<b>And if a man prevails against the one</b> If bandits came upon him to prevail against him, if they are two, they will stand against him, and surely, if they are three, for a three-stranded cord will not easily be broken. Another explanation: Whoever is a Torah scholar, as well as his son and his grandson, the Torah will never cease from his seed, and so Scripture states (Isa. 59:21): “shall not move from your mouth or from the mouth of your seed or from the mouth of your seed’s seed.” Another explanation:
<b>and a three-stranded cord</b> in Bible, Mishnah, and good manners—will not quickly sin. “There is one, and there is no second,” is expounded in the Midrash in other ways, but the sequence of all these verses does not fit in with them.
@13
<b>Better a poor and wise child</b> This is the good inclination, and why is it called a child? Because it does not enter man until thirteen years.

<b>than an old and foolish king</b> the evil inclination, which rules over all the limbs.
<b>old</b> for when the child is born, it is put into him, as it is said (Gen. 4:7): “sin lies at the opening.”
<b>and foolish</b> for it misleads him in the way of evil. In this manner, it is interpreted in the Midrash (Ecc. Rabbah).

@14
<b>For out of the prison he has come to reign</b> Heb. הָסוּרִים ; from the place of filth and stench, as we translate: (Exod. 16:29) וַיִבְאַשּׁ, (and it became putrid) as וּסְרִי.
<b>for even in his kingdom</b> Since he reigned over man, the poor one was born; the poor one, who was better than he, and who came out of purity, not out of the filth of the womb. So did our Rabbis interpret it in the Midrash. [See Ecc. Rabbah.] Another explanation:
<b>[13] Better a poor and wise child, etc.</b> according to its apparent meaning.
<b>who no longer knows to receive admonition</b> for he has already aged in his wickedness and foolishness.
<b>[14] For out of the prison he has come to reign</b> For the poor child—it will ultimately be said about him that he came to reign from the midst of his affliction and from the place of his imprisonment, for the “sammech” of הָסוּרִים is punctuated without a “dagesh,” which is equivalent to הָאֲסוּרִים. [Some editions: like (Isa. 13:20): “and no Arab shall pitch his tent (יַהֵל) there, like יֶאֶהַל], for so we found that Joseph reigned following his being freed from prison, and so David, (II Sam. 7:8): “I took you from the sheepcote, from following the sheep.”
<b>for even in his kingdom he becomes humble</b> For it is fitting and proper that he should reign, because even in his kingdom, he changed from the custom of the ruling class and he humbled himself to the sages, like the custom of the poor. And so (Job 11:12): “and [from] a wild donkey a man will be born (יִוָלֵד),” that he will be changed and converted from what he was, resembling a wild donkey, and he will become a man. נוֹלַד means “becomes,” and it is in the present tense.
@15
<b>I saw all the living, etc.</b> I found in the Midrash of this Book (Ecc. Zuta): This refers to the Generation of the Flood, about which it says (Gen. 6:19): “And of every living thing.”

@16
<b>There is no end to all the people</b> They were fruitful and multiplied too much, as it is said (Job 21: 8): “Their children are well established in their sight.” A woman would conceive and bear in three days; (ibid. verse 11): “They send forth their infants like sheep.”
<b>to all that were before them</b> There was no end to all the good that was before them, but all was lost, and in a moment descended to the grave.
<b>also the last ones</b> the Generation of the Dispersion.
<b>will not rejoice</b> with the good that was given into their hands.
<b>for this too</b> Its end is that of vanity and frustration, when one follows his evil inclination.

<b>For a dream comes with much concern</b> For it is usual for a dream to come because of the many thoughts upon which a person ponders and thinks during the day, and it is usual for the voice of a fool to come with many words, because by increasing his words, he utters a voice of foolishness from his mouth, for [from talking too much] transgression is inevitable; therefore, I say that your words should be few.

<b>wonder not</b> about the will of the Omnipresent, when He brings evil upon them.
<b>for the Highest over the high waits</b> and sees their deeds, and there are higher ones [i.e., angels] over them who perform the agency of the Omnipresent, and they have a strong hand to punish them.
<b>and deprivation of justice</b> Heb. וְגֵזֶל מִשְּׁפָּט, deprivation of justice. Since it is in the construct state, it is vowelized גֶזֶל, with a small “pattah” (seggol), for were it not in the construct state, it would be vowelized גָזֵל with a “kamatz.” Another explanation: If you see that they oppress the poor and deprive them of justice, and you see charity coming to the city, that the Holy One, blessed be He, lavishes goodness upon them and does not mete retribution upon them, do not wonder about the will of the Omnipresent, for so is His custom, to be slow to anger.
<b>for the Highest over the high waits</b> He waits until their measure is full.
<b>and...higher ones</b> He has over them to recompense them when the time of their visitation arrives, like (Job 14:15): “You do not wait (תִשְּׁמוֹר) for my sin”; (Isa. 26:2): “awaiting (שֹּׁמֵר) the realization”; (Gen. 37:11): “awaited (שָּׁמַר) the matter.”

<b>Whoever loves silver will not be sated with silver</b> Whoever loves the commandments will not be sated with them.
<b>and he who loves a multitude</b> of many commandments.
<b>without increase</b> and none of them has a specific and recognizable commandment, such as the building of the Temple or a synagogue, or a beautiful Sepher Torah.
<b>this too is vanity</b> So are these two verses expounded upon in the Midrash, and there are other suitable interpretations, but I stated this one first because it is related to the matter of (verse 7): “and there are higher ones over them,” which Scripture juxtaposed to them. Another explanation:
<b>[8] And the loftiness of the earth is over everything</b> The reward for tilling the soil is esteemed over everything, for even the king must be subservient to the field; if the earth produced fruits, he will eat, but if not, he dies from hunger.
<b>[9] Whoever loves silver will not be sated with silver</b> He will not eat money, and he who loves a multitude—of money...
<b>without grain</b> that he does not gather for himself produce—this too is vanity. Another explanation:
<b>[8] And the loftiness of the land is in everything</b> The reward of Israel is in all words of Torah, both in Scripture, in Mishnah, and in Gemara.
<b>the king is subservient to the field</b> If he is [well-versed] in Scripture and in Mishnah, he must still be subservient to the one well-versed in Gemara, because he arranges before him the practical decisions of prohibition and permissibility, uncleanness and cleanness, and laws of jurisprudence.
<b>[9] Whoever loves silver</b> Whoever loves Torah, will not be sated with it.
<b>and he who loves a multitude</b> of Torah.
<b>without grain</b> [He] who has [knowledge of] Scripture and Mishnah, but has no [knowledge of] Gemara, what use does he have? All these are in Leviticus Rabbah (23:13).

<b>The sleep of the laborer is sweet</b> The one who tills the soil sleeps, and he enjoys his sleep, whether he eats little or whether he eats much, for he is already accustomed to it.
<b>but the satiety of the rich does not allow him to sleep</b> But the satiety of belongings of the rich man, who owns much merchandise, does not allow him to sleep; all night he thinks about them. Another explanation: The year of the one who serves God is sweet; whether the days of his years are few or many, he will eat his reward—the one who had few years like the one who had many years. Moses led Israel forty years, and the prophet Samuel led them ten years, yet Scripture equated them, this one like that one, as it is said (Ps. 99.6): “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call in His name, etc.” So is it expounded upon in Tanhuma (Ki Thissa 3).
<b>but the satiety of the rich</b> the one who has taught many traditions.

<b>for God is testimony, etc.</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, [testifies] a constant testimony about this forever.
<b>of the joy of his heart</b> that he rejoiced to do good in his lifetime, and I saw in the Midrash (Ecc. Rabbah): This refers to Elkanah, who led Israel up to Shiloh on the festivals, and on the way that he brought them up on one year he did not bring them up the foll owing year, in order to publicize the matter and to accustom them [to perform the pilgrimage]. Therefore, Scripture praises him (I Sam. 1:3): “And that man was wont to go up from his city, etc.” I believe [lit., I say] that this Midrash is [based on] the end of the verse: “for God is testimony of the joy of his heart.” This is Elkanah, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, established in the Scriptures, and testified about him: “And that man was wont to go up from his city.”
<b>testimony</b> Heb. מַעֲנֶה. This is vowelized with a “pattah kattan” (seggol). Therefore, I explain it as a noun, like (Job 32:5): “for there was no answer (מַעֲנֶה) in the mouth of the three men.”
<b>of the joy of his heart</b> that he was happy on the festival.

<b>riches and property</b> According to its simple explanation, it should be interpreted as its apparent meaning.
<b>and God gives him no power to eat of it</b> that he should rejoice in his portion to find satisfaction in his riches, for he strives to oppress and to accumulate much wealth, as it is said (Hab. 2: 5): “and he is like death and shall never be sated,” and God will also not give him power to perform charity, to eat therefrom in the future, but a strange man will take that money and perform charity with it and derive benefit therefrom. The Midrash Aggadah (Ecc. Rabbah, Yerushalmi Horayoth 3:5) [explains it as referring] to words of Torah.
<b>riches and property and honor</b> Bible, Mishnah, and Aggadah.
<b>gives him no power</b> Since he did not achieve [knowledge of] Gemara, he consequently has no benefit therefrom in any practical instruction.

<b>and he will have much throughout the days of his years</b> (and much property and all goodness the days of his life). וְרַב is an expression of sufficiency, a sufficient degree of all goodness.

<b>neither did he have burial</b> Sometimes he is slain, and dogs consume him. Now all these things were found in Ahab: he begot many sons, and he had much property, but he coveted the property of others and did not find satisfaction with his money, and dogs devoured him.
<b>the stillborn is better than he</b> [The stillborn] of a woman, for the stillborn comes in vanity and goes; he did not see good and did not desire it; so he need not be distressed.

<b>and is the appetite not yet sated</b> This is a question. But this one—did he not even gratify his desire with a small pleasure? [This is] like (Exod. 15:9): “My lust shall be satisfied upon them (תִּמְלָאֵמוֹ נַפְשִׁי),” an expression of attaining a desire, and since this is so.

<b>For what is the advantage</b> [i.e., what advantage] did he have with his wisdom, more than if he were a fool?
<b>What has the poor man</b> a disadvantage over the rich man who has no satisfaction? He too knows how to go along with the living. Another explanation:

@9
<b>Better is what he sees with his eyes than that which goes to sate his appetite</b> It would have been better and more proper for this person to see his riches with the vision of his eyes, than food and drink, which go into his body. Another explanation: טוֹב מַרְאֵה עֵינַיִם מֵהֲלָךְ נָפֶשׁ This person prefers and it seems better and more proper for him to follow his eyes, to rob and to oppress, rather than the course of his soul, that he did not put his mind [to realize] where his soul will go when he dies.

<b>the number of the days of his life of vanity</b> which are few in number.

It is interpreted in this manner in the Midrash (Ecc. Rabbah).

<b>A [good] name is better than good oil</b> A good name is better for a person than good oil, and on the day of death the name is better than on the day of his birth. For this reason, a good name is compared to good oil more than to other liquids, for oil—you put water into it, and it floats and rises, and is recognizable, but other liquids—you put water into them, and they absorb it.
<b>A [good] name is better than good oil</b> Good oil runs down, as it is said: (Ps. 133:2): “As the good oil on the head runs down upon the beard.” A good name, however, goes up, as it is said: (Gen. 12:2): “and I will make your name great.” Good oil is temporary, but a good name is eternal, as it is said: (Ps. 72:17): “May his name be forever.” Good oil flows from the flask to the palace, and no more, but a good name goes to the end of the world. Said Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon: We find that those who had good oil entered the place of life and emerged burnt up. These are Nadab and Abihu, who were anointed with the anointing oil. And we find those who possessed a good name, who entered a place of death and emerged alive, viz. Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who emerged from the fiery furnace.

<b>It is better to go to a house of mourning</b> a type of conduct that serves both the living and the dead.
<b>than to go to a house of feasting</b> A type of conduct that serves only the living.
<b>for that is the end of every man</b> Since mourning marks the end of every man, every man will ultimately come to this. Therefore, the living should put his heart [to the fact] that whatever loving-kindness I bestow upon the dead, I will require that they bestow the same to me upon my death. He who raises his voice in lamentation—they will raise their voices in lamentation for him; he who bears the dead—they will bear him; he who eulogizes—they will eulogize him; he who escorts [the dead]—they will escort him (Ecc. Rabbah, Keth. 72a). Another explanation:
<b>for that is the end of every man:</b> For that is the end of the whole man; for death is the end of all man’s days, and if now he does not bestow kindness upon him, he will no longer bestow it upon him, but if he invited him to a house of feasting and he did not go, he can say to him, “A son will ultimately be born to you, and there I will be with you. The joy of your children’s wedding will come to you, and there I will go.”
<b>and the living shall lay it to his heart</b> this matter, that if he does not bestow kindness now, he will no longer [have the opportunity to] bestow it upon him.

<b>Vexation is better than laughter</b> If one is pursued by the Divine Standard of Justice, let him not be distressed. It would have been better for the Generation of the Flood if the Holy One, blessed be He, had shown them an angry countenance because of the sins in their hands, rather than the laughter that He laughed with them, for had He shown them a slight expression of displeasure, they would have returned to do good (Ecc. Rabbah). It would have been better for Adonijah had his father caused him grief for every sin that he committed, rather than the laughter that he showed him, and for which he was ultimately slain (Ecc. Zuta).

<b>The end of a thing is better than its beginning</b> [This is to be interpreted] according to its apparent meaning. At the beginning of a matter, we do not know what will be at its end, but when the end is good, it ends well. Another explanation: The end of a thing is good from its beginning: when it is good from its beginning, i.e., that they had good intentions when they started it. Rabbi Meir stood and expounded the entire matter as referring to Elisha the son of Abuyah, in Midrash Koheleth (Ecc. Rabbah).

<b>there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness</b> Even though he is perishing, he still persists in his righteousness. There was an incident concerning Joseph the son of Phinehas the priest who had an ulcerating sore on his foot. They called the physician to amputate his foot. He said to him, “When you reach [the last remaining] hairbreadth, let me know.” He did so, and he called his son Hunia. He said to him, “My son, until now, you were obligated to care for me. From now on, you are not obligated to care for me, because a kohen may not become unclean from a limb cut off from his father during his lifetime.”

<b>and be not overly wise</b> to deduce from a foolish inference from a minor case to a major case, namely that if the Torah said that for [the murder of] one person, bring a decapitated heifer, [surely we must not be allowed to slay an entire nation, i.e., this refers to Saul’s erroneous concern about killing Amalek].
@17
<b>Be not overly wicked</b> Even if you have dealt wickedly in a small degree, do not continue to deal wickedly.
<b>why should you die before your time</b> like Saul, as it is said: (I Chron. 10:13): “And Saul died because of the treachery that he had committed” in the case of Nob the priestly city and in the case of Amalek.
@18

@19
<b>Wisdom affords strength to the wise</b> Since he said: Be not overly wicked—if you have dealt wickedly in a small degree, do not add to it, but search your deeds and regret the sin—he says: Wisdom affords strength to the wise, for it counsels him to return in repentance.
<b>more than ten rulers</b> We find regarding Josiah, that Scripture testified about him (II Kings 23:25): “Now before him there was no king like him, etc.” Hence, his wisdom stood him in good stead, and he searched his deeds, and it was better for him than the ten kings who behaved wickedly and did not repent of their ways.
<b>who were in the city</b> in Jerusalem, viz. Rehoboam, Abijah, Ahaziah, Joash after the death of Jehoiada, Amaziah, Ahaz, Manasseh, Amon, Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah.

<b>For there is no righteous man on earth</b> Therefore, he must examine his deeds.
@21
<b>Also take no heed of all the words, etc.</b> Because he is speaking of Saul, who accepted slander about Nob the priestly city, and concerning him it was stated: “Be not overly wicked,” he says: “Also take no heed of all the words” that talebearers speak to you; do not take heed to accept them.
<b>lest you hear your servant curse you</b> It is not good that you bend your ear to hear your servant cursing you. Another explanation:
<b>[19] more than ten rulers</b> These are the ten things that condemn a person. His two eyes [which] show him sinful things, his two ears [which] enable him to hear idle talk, his two hands with which he robs and plunders, his two feet which lead him to sinful acts, and his mouth and his heart (Ecc. Zuta). Another explanation:
<b>Wisdom affords strength to the wise</b> This is Noah.
<b>more than ten rulers</b> more than the ten generations that were before him (Ecc. Rabbah). Another explanation:

<b>more than ten rulers</b> These are his brothers (Ecc. Zuta). Another explanation:

<b>ten rulers</b> the ten organs that minister to the body with food. From the mouth to the esophagus, from the esophagus to the stomach, etc., as appears in Midrash Koheleth (Ecc. Rabbah), but Moses’ wisdom stood him in good stead so that he did not require food for forty days and forty nights. All these interpretations appear in the Midrash, but I do not know how to reconcile them with the following verse: “For there is no righteous man on the earth.”

So did our Rabbis explain it in Tractate Sotah (8b).
<b>said Koheleth</b> said the collection of wisdom, and said his intellectual soul, which collects the wisdom.
<b>Koheleth</b> This is a feminine noun, and when it is used in the masculine sense, it refers to the one who gathers it, and that is Solomon. In the Midrash (Ecc. Zuta): Said Rabbi Jeremiah the son of Eleazar: The holy spirit sometimes speaks in the masculine gender and sometimes it speaks in the feminine gender. One verse says (Ps. 70:6): “You are my help (עֶזְרִי) and my rescuer,” and one verse says (ibid. 40:18): “You are my help (עֶזְרָתִי) and my rescuer.” One verse says: (Nahum 2:1): “a herald (מְבַשֵּׂר) announcing peace,” and one verse says (Isa. 40:9): “the voice of (sic) the herald (מְבַשֶּׂרֶת) of Zion.”

Do not read וְיִשְׁתַּכְּחוּ, and they will be forgotten, but וְיִשְׁתַּבְּחוּ, and they will boast. So did our Rabbis of blessed memory expound it (Gittin 56b). Concerning the forgetting, [i.e., the legitimate wording of the verse], it is expounded as follows in the Aggadah (unknown): and ultimately, their name and their remembrance will be forgotten from that very city, that they did so therein, as it is said (Joel 4:2): “I will gather all the nations and I will take them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.” In the place where they angered Him, He will mete out retribution upon them, and so Scripture states (Ps. 73:20): “O Lord, in the city You will despise their form.”
<b>this too</b> is one of the vanities that were given to the world to weary mankind, for the Holy One, blessed be He, does not hasten to mete out retribution upon evildoers, and mankind thinks that there is neither judgment nor Judge.
@11
<b>Because the sentence of the deed of evil is not executed swiftly</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, does not hasten to mete out retribution upon the evildoers, and therefore, they think that there is no judgment, and their heart is encouraged to do evil.
@12
<b>For a sinner, etc.</b> because they see that the sinner does evil a hundred thousand and myriads [of times], and the Holy One, blessed be He, grants him an extension.
<b>a hundred</b> This is an ellipsis, and it is connected to the words preceding it, saying: a hundred days, a hundred years, a hundred thousand. And so, (Isa. 51:21): “and drunk”, וּשְׁכֻרַת, is an ellipsis, and it is missing [the word כַּעַס]: drunk from wrath and not from wine, like other drunkenness.
<b>but I know too</b> For despite all this, that He does not hasten to mete retribution upon the wicked to make a distinction between the righteous and the wicked, I know that each one will ultimately receive his recompense, and that those who fear Him will fare well.
@13
<b>But it will not be well with the wicked</b> because he does not fear God.
@14
<b>There is vanity</b> which causes people to think foolishly.
<b>that there are righteous men</b> to whom evil happens [fitting as retribution for] the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked to whom good happens [fitting as reward for] the deeds of the righteous. I said that this too is one of the vanities that prevail in the world. However, our Rabbis expounded it in a different manner in Tractate Horayoth (10b), but to me, it is not explained satisfactorily, according to the line of thought here where the wise man (Koheleth) concludes by saying, “This too is vanity.”

<b>joy</b> for he should rejoice in his lot and engage in the “upright commands,”(See Ps. 19:9) which cause the heart to rejoice, and he should not be absorbed in increasing his wealth with usury and interest and robbery. Whoever does not rejoice in his lot and is absorbed in amassing money, eventually commits the sins of robbery, fraud, and taking interest. One who does not rejoice in his lot concerning the love of his wife, has a passionate lust for women, and harbors erotic thoughts about married women.
<b>to eat and to drink</b> from what the Holy One, blessed be He, graciously granted him, and to rejoice with his lot. And [according to] the Midrash Aggadah (Ecc. Rabbah 2:26): All mention of eating and drinking in Ecclesiastes, refers only to the study of Torah, as it is stated (Isa. 55:1): “go, buy and eat, etc.”
<b>and that will accompany him</b> will join him, as it is stated (ibid. 58:8): “and your righteousness shall go before you.”
<b>the days of his life that God gave him</b> he shall do so, and the end of the verse is connected to its beginning, and it is a transposed verse, [to be interpreted thus:] there is nothing better for man in the days of his life that God gave him than to eat, drink and rejoice, and that will accompany him in his toil.

All this they know, but nevertheless, they choose for themselves the good way, because they know that there is a difference between them in the World to Come.
<b>for the righteous</b> such as Noah.
<b>and for the wicked</b> such as Pharaoh-Neco. This one became crippled, and that one became crippled.
<b>for the good</b> This is Moses.

<b>and for he who sacrifices</b> This is Josiah, as it is said: “And Josiah offered a sacrifice.”
<b>and for he who does not sacrifice</b> This is Ahab, who caused Israel to refrain from performing the festival pilgrimages. This one died from arrows, and that one died from arrows.

<b>For whoever is joined to all the living has hope</b> For as long as he is alive, even if he is wicked and is joined to the wicked, as it is said: “to all the living”—even [if he is joined] to the wicked—he has hope, perhaps he will repent before his death.
<b>for concerning a live dog he is better than a dead lion</b> and they are both wicked. It was better for Nebuzaradan, who was a wicked slave and converted to Judaism, that death did not overtake him early, than for Nebuchadnezzar his master, who was called “lion,” as it is said (Jer. 4:7): “A lion has come up from his thicket,” who died in his wickedness, [and ended up] in Gehinnom, while his slave is in the Garden of Eden. Our Rabbis expounded upon this the rule that we may butcher a carcass for dogs on the Sabbath, but a human corpse, lying in the sun, may not be moved unless one places a child or a loaf of bread thereon.
@5
<b>For the living know that they will die</b> and perhaps their hearts will return on the day of death and they will repent of their ways, but after they die, they do not know anything, and they have no more reward for the actions that they do from their deaths and onwards, for whoever toils on the eve of the Sabbath will eat on the Sabbath.

<b>At all times, let your garments be white</b> Prepare yourself at all times with good deeds, so that if you die today, you will enter in peace. And Solomon likened this to a man whom the king invited for a day of feasting, without setting a time for him.

<b>for there is neither deed, etc. in the grave</b> for your merit after you die, and if you did so, you have no reckoning in the grave to worry about. The verse is transposed, [to be explained]: for there is neither deed nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave for the wicked, nor reckoning for the righteous, when the wicked give their accounting. So is it expounded in the Midrash (unknown). And one who interprets it without transposing it, according to its apparent meaning, interprets חֶשְּׁבּוֹן as an expression of “thought,” what he can still do to free himself from judgment.

<b>nor do the understanding have riches</b> e.g., Job, in the beginning, (Job 1:3): “His livestock consisted of, etc.,” and when his time came, he said, (ibid. 19:21): “Have pity on me, you, my friends.”
<b>nor the knowledgeable, favor</b> Moses, for example—there was no one more knowledgeable and wiser than he in Israel, and yet he did not find favor with his prayer to enter the Land.

<b>and one sinner destroys much good</b> Had she not slain Sheba the son of Bichri, they would all have been destroyed by him. (Ecc. Rabbah). Another explanation:
<b>and one sinner destroys much good</b> If Israel were [composed] half of righteous people and half of wicked ones, and one person came and sinned, making the wicked the majority, the result would be that he weighed them all down to the guilty side.

<b>Dying flies make putrid and foamy, etc.</b> e.g., in the winter season, when the flies have no strength, and they are near death: if it falls into the oil of a perfumer and becomes mingled with the perfumes, it causes it to become putrid and it assumes a foam, which is called zecume in Old French, foam, froth, bubbles, and a sort of bubbles (אֲבַעְבּוּעוֹת) appears in it, and this is the meaning of יַבִּיעַ. Hence we have an insignificant thing spoiling an important thing. So does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor, for it outweighed them all. Let us suppose that this man was equal with half transgressions and half merits, and he came and committed one transgression, which weighed him down to the scale of demerit. It is found that this folly, which is a small thing, is heavy and weighs and is heavier than all the wisdom and the honor that were in him, for behold, it outweighed them all. יָקָר is an expression of weight. It is heavy and weighs more than the wisdom and the honor in him. The Midrash Aggadah (Ber. 61a) states: Scripture compares the evil inclination to dying flies.

So will he who commits evil reap according to what he sows.

<b>but wisdom has a greater advantage</b> But wisdom has another advantage over iron, namely, that if a Torah scholar blackens his face with hunger, and you see him as a poor man among the rich, many armies are strengthened by him. Do not wonder about the “vav” of וַחֲיָלִים, for many “vavin” appear like that in Hebrew, like (Ps. 50:18): “If you saw a thief, you agreed (וַתִּרֶץ) with him”; (Exod. 15:2): “The strength and the cutting of the Lord was (וַיְהִי) to me a salvation,” and many are explained in this manner.

<b>and what will be behind him, who will tell him</b> i.e., not only does he not know what will be after a time, but even what is present behind him, which is not in front of his eyes, but behind his back, from afar, he needs someone to tell him [what is happening].

<b>As you do not know, etc., as things enclosed in the full womb</b> things closed in and confined in the womb which is full, even though it protrudes outward, just as you do not know the way of the wind. This is a transposed verse, expounded from its end to its beginning. Just as you do not know the way of the wind, i.e., the knowledge of both these things is equal. Neither is this one revealed to you nor is that one revealed to you. Sometimes you think to perceive in the clouds that the wind will come, and it does not come here, but it passes and goes away to another land. This expression is like (Gen. 13: 10): “like the garden of the Lord, so the land of Egypt”; (Isa. 24:2): “as with the maidservant, so with her mistress; as with the buyer so with the seller.” Sometimes Scripture compares the former to the latter, and sometimes it compares the latter to the former. Here too, it teaches the knowledge of the wind from the knowledge of the womb, i.e., you should not await the wind by looking at the clouds. (GLOSS: This matter is transposed in Rashi’s words, and it is in the opposite order. We must therefore emend it as it is in exact editions, and then it will better understood, and this is the authentic version:
<b>As you do not know</b> This is a transposed verse, explained from the end to the beginning: Just as you cannot identify the things enclosed in the full womb, that is, the things closed in and confined in the full womb, and even though it protrudes outward, you do not know what is in her womb, so do you not know the way of the wind, i.e., the knowledge of both these things is equal [from the book Sifthei Hachamim].)
<b>as things enclosed</b> Heb כַּעֲצָמִים, enclos in Old French, like (Isa. 33:15): “and closes (וְעֹצֵם) his eyes.”
<b>so you will not know, etc.</b> Also the decrees of the Omnipresent in matters of poverty and riches are hidden from you, and you should not refrain from doing kindness because you are concerned, perhaps I will lack some of my possessions and become impoverished. I will not engage in Torah and neglect my work and become poor. I will not wed and have children, because I will have to spend money on them.

We find in the case of Rabbi Akiva that he had twenty-four thousand disciples from Gabbath to Antipatris, and they all died between Passover and Shavuoth, and he came to our Sages in the south and taught them. And concerning children, we find in the case of Ibzan, (Jud. 12:9): “and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in for his sons,” and they all died in his lifetime (Baba Bathra 91a), but in his old age, he begot Obed, who survived him.

<b>let him rejoice in them all</b> Let him be happy with his lot, provided that he remember the days of darkness and improve his deeds so that he be saved from them, and these are the days of eternal death; they are the days of the wicked.
<b>for they will be many</b> in those days, more than the days of life.
<b>all that befalls</b> him will be vanity and darkness. There is הֶבֶל, that is an expression of retribution and troubles, like (above 6:4): “for he comes in vanity and goes in darkness.”

<b>Rejoice, O youth, in your childhood</b> like a man who says to his slave or to his son, “Sin, sin, for one time you will suffer for all.” Here too, the wise man says: “Rejoice, O youth, in your childhood... and go in the ways of your heart,” but be assured “that for all these, the judge will bring you to judgment.”

<b>And remember your Creator</b> There (Avoth 3:1) we learned: Akabia the son of Mahalalel says: Reflect upon three things etc. And he derived it from this verse: And remember your Creator (בּוֹרְאֶיךָ) that you will give an accounting and reckoning before Him; and remember your pit (בּוֹרֶךָ), your grave, a place of earth, maggots, and worms; and remember your well (בְּאֵרֶךָ), the well that flows from its source: that is the putrid droplet of seed and semen.

<b>Before the sun...darken</b> Our Sages said: This is the forehead, which gives light and shines on a young man, but when he grows old, it becomes wrinkled and does not shine.
<b>and the light</b> This is the nose, which is the form of the features of the face.
<b>and the moon</b> This is the soul, which gives light for a person, for once it is taken away from him, he ceases to have light in his eyes.
<b>and the stars</b> These are the cheeks, the pomegranates of the face, called pomels (cheekbones) of the cheeks, which shine.
<b>and the clouds return after the rain</b> The dimming of the light will come after the tears of the weeping for the many troubles that passed over him.
@3
<b>the keepers of the house</b> These are the ribs and the flanks, which protect the entire body cavity.
<b>and the mighty men are seized by cramps</b> Heb. וְהִתְעַוְּתוּ. עִוּוּת, called crampe, will seize them. וְהִתְעַוְּתוּ is encranpiront in Old French, will be seized with cramp.
<b>the mighty men</b> These are the legs, upon which the body supports itself.

<b>when the sound of the mill is low</b> the sound of the mill grinding the food in his intestines, and that is the stomach.
<b>and one shall rise at the voice of a bird</b> For even the voice of a bird awakens him from his sleep since he has become old.
<b>and all the songstresses shall be brought low</b> Heb. וְיִשַּׁחוּ. All the sounds of musical instruments seem to him like conversation (שִׂיחָה). Its apparent meaning is like its simple interpretation, that יִשַּׁחוּ is like יִשְׁפָּלוּ, shall be brought low. All the singers and songstresses shall be low in his eyes, and so did Barzilai the Gileadite say to David, (II Sam. 19:36): “or can I still listen to the voice of singers and songstresses?”
@5
<b>Also from the high places they will fear</b> from the mounds and bumps in the streets: he is afraid to go out into the street lest he stumble on them.
<b>and terrors on the road</b> Heb. וְחַתְחַתִּים. He has many fears and terrors on the road. חַתְחַתִּים This is a word consisting of doubled language, like גַלְגַלִים, wheels, קַשְׂקַשִׂים, scales, זַלְזַלִים, tendrils.
<b>and...blossoms</b> Heb. וְיָנֵאץ, an expression of (Song 7: 13): “whether the pomegranates have blossomed (הֵנֵצוּ),” for the “aleph” in it is not pronounced. Our Rabbis said: This is the haunch, hanche in French, into which the hip bone is thrust, and in his old age, the flesh is emaciated, and the bone protrudes, like the blossom of a tree which protrudes.
<b>the almond tree</b> Heb. הַשָׁקֵד, an almond tree, i.e., old age will spring upon him like this almond tree, which hastens to blossom before all the other trees.
<b>and the grasshopper will drag itself along</b> These are the buttocks, for his buttocks will seem to him to be as one who bears a heavy burden. וְיִסְתַּבֵּל, ert porfessez in Old French, and will be overburdened.
<b>and the sexual desire will fail</b> the desire for women; for he will have no urge to be intimate with women. הָאֲבִיוֹנָה, means desire, like (Deut. 1: 26): “But you did not want (אֲבִיתֶם)” (Ps. 119:174): “I yearned (תָּאַבְתִּי) for Your salvation.”

<b>Before the silver cord snaps</b> This is the spinal cord, which is as white as silver, and when he dies, its marrow diminishes and empties out and dries and becomes crooked within the vertebrae, and it becomes like a chain. יֵרָתֵק is an expression of silver chains (רְתֻקוֹת).
<b>and the golden fountain is shattered</b> This is the male organ, which emits a flow of water (urine), which flows like a fountain, like (Josh. 15:19): “the upper springs (גֻלֹֹּת).” וְתָרֻץ is an expression of shattering (רְצִיצָה).
<b>and the pitcher breaks at the fountain</b> This is the stomach, which is thick and splits upon his death.
<b>and the wheel falls shattered into the pit</b> The eyeball will be shattered within its socket. According to its simple interpretation, this is a wheel with which they draw water from the cistern. So is this entire matter expounded in Tractate Shabbath (151b 152a). Midrash Kinoth (Lam. Rabbah, Proem 23), however, interprets it as referring to all Israel: [1]
<b>And remember your Creator in the days of your youth</b> As long as your you are still called chosen, as long as the priesthood still endures, as it is said (I Sam. 2: 28): “And I did choose him from all the tribes of Israel to be My priest”; as long as the covenant of the Levites still endures, as it is said (Deut. 18:5): “For the Lord your God has chosen him out of all your tribes”; as long as the kingdom of the House of David still endures, as it is said (Ps. 78:70): “And He chose His servant David”; as long as Jerusalem still endures, as it is said (I Kings 11:32): “the city that I have chosen”; as long as the chosen Temple still endures, about which it is stated (II Chron. 7: 16): “And now I have chosen and consecrated this House”; as long as you still endure, as it is said (Deut. 7:6): “the Lord your God has chosen you.”
<b>before the days of evil come</b> These are the days of the exile. [2]
<b>Before the sun...darken</b> This is the kingdom of the House of David of which it is written (Ps. 89:37): “And his throne is like the sun before Me.”
<b>and the light</b> This is the Torah, as it is said (Prov. 6:23): “For a commandment is a candle and the Torah is light.”
<b>and the moon</b> This refers to the Sanhedrin, of which we learned (Sanh. 4:3): “The seating of the Sanhedrin was in the shape of a semi- circular threshing floor.”
<b>and the stars</b> These are the Rabbis, as it is said (Dan. 12:3): “and those who bring the multitudes to righteousness are like the stars.”
<b>and the clouds return after the rain</b> calamity after harsh calamity. You find concerning all the harsh prophecies that Jeremiah prophesied about them, that they befell them only after the destruction of the Temple. [3]
<b>On the day that the keepers of the house tremble</b> This refers to the watches of the priests and the Levites.
<b>and the mighty men are seized by cramps</b> These are the priests, who are mighty in strength. Said Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: Aaron lifted twenty-two thousand Levites in one day. Said Rabbi Hanina: The bird’s crop is a light thing, yet the priest would throw it more than thirty cubits.
<b>and the grinders cease</b> These are the great collections of Mishnah: the Mishnah of Rabbi Akiva, the Mishnah of Rabbi Hiyya, and the Mishnah of Bar Kappara.
<b>and those who look...become darkened</b> that the Talmud will be forgotten from the heart. [4]
<b>And the doors are shut in the street</b> for example, the doors of Nehushta the son (read: the daughter) of Elnathan, which were wide open.
<b>when the sound of the mill is low</b> because they did not engage in the words of Torah. Said Rabbi Samuel: Israel is compared to the grinding of the millstones; just as the millstones are idle neither by day nor by night, here too, (Josh. 1:8): “you shall meditate therein day and night.”
<b>and one rises at the voice of a bird</b> This is the wicked Nebuchadnezzar. Rabbi Levi said: For eighteen years a heavenly voice went forth and in Nebuchadnezzar’s palace and proclaimed: “Wicked slave, go and destroy your Master’s House because His children disobey Him.”
<b>and all the songstresses are brought low</b> (Isa. 24:9): “In song, they shall not drink wine.” [5]
<b>Also from the Most High they fear</b> He was afraid of He Who is Supreme in the universe, and his heart was concerned lest He do to him as He did to his predecessors.
<b>and terrors on the road</b> Because of this, he will seek omens and portents [to see if] he will succeed on the way that he will go, as it is stated (Ezek. 21:26): “For the king of Babylon stood at the crossroads, to divine; he furbished the arrows, he inquired of the teraphim.”
<b>and the almond tree will blossom</b> Jeremiah’s prophecy will grow, as it is said (Jer. 1:11): “I see the rod of an almond tree.” Said Rabbi Eliezer: This almond tree, from the time it blossoms until its fruits are ripe, are twenty-one days. Likewise, from the seventeenth of Tammuz until the ninth of Av are twenty-one days.
<b>and the grasshopper will drag itself along</b> This is Nebuchadnezzar’s image (Dan. 3:1): “its height sixty cubits, its width six cubits.” Now, if its thickness is not six, it cannot stand, and you say that, “he set it up in the plain of Dura”? Said Rav Beivai: They set it up and it fell; they set it up and it fell, until they brought all the gold in Jerusalem and poured it out as a base on its feet, to fulfill what is stated (Ezek. 7:19): “and their gold will be repugnant.”
<b>and the avionah fails</b> This is the ancestral merit; the support of your Patriarchs will fail; accordingly, אֲבִיוֹנָה is derived from אָב, father.
<b>for man goes</b> Israel, who were called (Ezek. 36: 37) “men like a flock of sheep”; (ibid. 34:31) “you are men.”
<b>to his everlasting home</b> They came from Babylon, and they returned to Babylon. Terah, the father of Abraham, was from the other side of the river [Euphrates].
<b>and the mourners go about in the street</b> The exile of Jeconiah preceded the exile of Zedekiah by eleven years. When Nebuchadnezzar exiled the exile of Zedekiah in neck irons, the exile of Jeconiah came out toward Nebuchadnezzar against their will, with the rest of the city dwellers, to praise him, that he was a hero and a victor, and they would see the captives and ask them, each one about his kinsman, what happened to him, and they would answer them, (Jer. 15:2): “Such as are for death to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.” And they would praise with one hand, and with their other hand, they would clap their hands and beat their sides in mourning for their brothers and for their children. [6]
<b>before the silver cord snaps</b> This is the genealogical chain.
<b>and the golden fountain is shattered</b> These are the words of Torah, as it is said (Ps. 19:11) “They are to be desired more than gold.”
<b>and the pitcher breaks at the fountain</b> The pitcher of Baruch the son of Neriah on the fountain of Jeremiah. They were both exiled to Babylon and stopped their studies because of the hardship of the journey. At first, they were exiled to Egypt, for Johanan the son of Kareah exiled them, and when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Egypt, he exiled them to Babylon.

<b>with large heads</b> Heb. אֲסֻפּוֹת, nails that have a large and thick head, grosse in French, large. So did Dunash the son of Labrat explain it (Teshuvoth Dunash, p. 44).
<b>given from one shepherd</b> All their words are the words of the living God. He said them, and one shepherd gave them, viz. Moses from God. וּכְמַשְׂמְרוֹת This is written with a “sin,” for the Torah (Tenach), with the twenty-four books coincide with the number of the watches (מִשְׁמָרוֹת) of the priests and the Levites.

<b>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim</b> Now is it possible to say so? Did he [Nebuchadnezzar] not reign in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as is stated (Jer. 25:1) “in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah that is the first year of Nebuchadnezzar?” So what is the meaning of “In the third year?” In the third year of his rebellion, as is stated (II Kings 24:1): “and Jehoiakim was his vassal for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him”; and in the third year, he overcame him, and that was the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar, for the master said (Seder Olam ch. 24): In his first year he conquered Nineveh, and in his second year he advanced and vanquished Jehoiakim, who served him for three years and rebelled against him for three years. That was the eleventh year of the reign of Jehoiakim: five years before he vanquished him, three years that he served him, and three years that he rebelled against him. And then Jehoiakim died under his hand, and in his stead, Nebuchadnezzar enthroned Jehoiachin, his son.

Because he was cut off (חֲתָכוּהוּ) from his greatness; [according to his explanation] we must say that this is Cyrus I, who preceded Ahasuerus. But according to the one who says that all royal affairs were decided (נֶחְתָּכִים) by his orders, we must say that this Cyrus was Darius II, [who came] after Ahasuerus, and in the days of Darius the Mede, when they cast [Daniel] into the lions’ den, he was not demoted from his greatness, as it is said (6:29): “And this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and during the reign of Cyrus the Persian.” We learn that during the days of Cyrus I he was [still] in his greatness.

@12
<b>In view of this</b> in view of this reply.
<b>in great wrath and anger</b> Aram. מַלְכָּא בְּנַס וּקְצַף שַּׂגִיא. The king was in great wrath and anger. (בְּנַס) means in wrath. (Gen. 40:6): “And behold they were angry (זעַפִים), and Onkelos renders: נסִיסִין.
<b>and ordered to destroy</b> Aram. וַאֲמַר לְהוֹבָדָה. About this “vav” of וַאֲמַר, Menahem and Dunash disputed. Menahem (p. 46) forced himself to make the “beth” of בְּנַס, a radical and did not interpret בְּנַס וּקְצַף as nouns, but as an expression of a verb: was greatly wroth and angry and ordered to destroy. The “vav” in וַאֲמַר forced him to interpret it this way. Dunash (p. 9) says that it is impossible for the “beth” to be a radical, but it is a noun, and he interpreted it in this manner: with great wrath and anger he ordered to destroy, and the “vav” there is superfluous, like the “vav” of (Ps. 76:7): “chariot (וְרֶכֶב) and horse.” But I say that the “vav” is not forced to be superfluous, but so is its interpretation: מַלְכָּא בְּנַס וּקְצַף שַּׂגִּיא, the king was in great wrath and anger, and he ordered in his wrath to destroy them. Accordingly, this is an elliptical verse.

<b>And Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of sixty-two</b> Why does he count his years? To tell you that on the day that Nebuchadnezzar entered the Heichal in the days of Jehoiachin, his adversary, Darius, was born (Seder Olam ch. 28). From the exile of Jeconiah until now were sixty-two years, and the master said: They were exiled in the days of Jehoiachin in the seventh year counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, which is eight years after the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. There remained to Nebuchadnezzar’s reign thirty-seven years, for he reigned forty-five years, and twenty-three of Evil-merodach’s, as our Sages stated in Tractate Megillah (11b), and the two years of Belshazzar that passed, totaling sixty-two.

Figure these from the time the daily sacrifice was discontinued until the daily sacrifice will be restored to its place; it was discontinued six years prior to the destruction, and there is somewhat of a proof in this Book. [See Rashi to 8:14.] Others bring further proof to this computation, namely that (Deut. 31:18): “And I, will hide My face” [the words] הַסְתֵּר אַסְתִּיר add up in gematria to 1,335.

<b>and...said</b> that angel.
<b>to the anonymous</b> Heb. לַפַּלְמוֹנִי. This word is like two: פְּלוֹנִי אַלְמוֹנִי, and Jonathan ben Uziel translated it in the Book of Samuel (I 21: 3): “covered and hidden,” like (Deut. 17:8): “If a matter be hidden (יִפָּלֵא) from you.” אַלְמוֹנִי means a widower (אַלְמָן) without a name, [i.e., bereft of a name] for he [the angel] did not explain to him what he was and what his name was.
<b>to the anonymous one who was speaking</b> to the angel who was speaking and issuing decrees, viz. “And a set time will be given for the daily sacrifice because of transgression.”
<b>How long will be the vision</b> this [vision] which concerns the daily sacrifice, that it should be discontinued, and the silent abomination will be placed in its stead. The silent abomination is an idol worshipped by the pagans, which was like a mute stone, and so it is called in this Book in many places, as it says (12:11): “And from the time the daily sacrifice was removed and the silent abomination placed.”
<b>mute</b> Heb. שֹּׁמֵם, an expression of being mute and silenced, like (4:16): “was bewildered (אֶשְּׁתּוֹמַם) for awhile;” (Ezek. 3:15): “and I sat there seven days bewildered (מַשְּׁמִים) among them,” like one who is dumb.
<b>permitting the Sanctuary and the host to be trampled</b> to make the base of the Sanctuary and the host of heaven, which he cast down to the earth, to be a trampling for his feet, as is stated above (verse 10): “and it cast down to the ground some of the host and some of the stars.”
<b>the Sanctuary and the host</b> Heb. וְקֹדֶשּׁ וְצָבָא. The “vav” [of וְקֹדֶשּׁ] is superfluous, and there are many such instances in Scripture, e.g. (Ps. 76:7): “chariot (וָרֶכֶב) and horse were stunned,” and also, in the language of people, some speak that way.
@14
<b>Until evening and morning, one thousand and three hundred</b> I saw an interpretation in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon for this matter, but it has already passed, and he interpreted further “until evening and morning,” that evening about which it says (Zech. 14:7): “and it shall come to pass that at eventide it shall be light,” and we are confident that our God’s word will stand forever; it will not be nullified. I say, however, that the עֶרֶב and בֹּקֶר stated here are a gematria, and there is support for this matter from two reasons: 1) that this computation should coincide with the other computation at the end of the Book, and 2) that Gabriel said to Daniel later on in this chapter (verse 26): “And the vision of the evening and the morning is true.” Now, if he had not hinted that the computation was doubtful, why did he repeat it to say that it was true? And the seer was commanded to close up and to seal the matter, and to him, too, the matter was revealed in a closed and sealed expression, but we will hope for the promise of our king for end after end, and when the end passes, it will be known that the expounder has erred in his interpretation, and the one who comes after him will search and expound in another manner. This can be interpreted [as follows]: namely, that עֶרֶב בֹּקֶר has the numerical value of 574, ע = 70; ר = 200; ב = 2; ב = 2; ק = 100; ר = 200. Added together, this equals 574; plus 2,300, we have 2,874.
<b>and the holy ones shall be exonerated</b> The iniquity of Israel shall be expiated to bring an end to the decrees of their being trodden upon and crumbled since they were exiled in their first exile to Egypt, until they will be redeemed and saved with a perpetual salvation by our king Messiah, and this computation terminates at the end of 1,290 years from the day the daily sacrifice was removed, and that is what is stated at the end of the Book (12:11): “And from the time the daily sacrifice is removed, and the silent abomination placed, will be 1,290 years,” and no more, for our king Messiah will come and remove the silent abomination. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction of the Second Temple, and an image was set up in the Heichal. Now that was the seventeenth day of Tammuz, when Apostomos burned the Torah, put an end to the daily sacrifice, and set up an image in the Heichal, as we learned in Tractate Ta’anith (26b), but for the six years that I mentioned, I have no explicit proof, but there is proof that the daily sacrifice was abolished less than a complete shemittah cycle before the destruction, for so did Daniel prophesy about Titus (9:27): “...and half the week of years [shemittah cycle] he will curtail sacrifice and meal-offering,” meaning that a part of the week of years before the destruction, sacrifices will be abolished. So it is explained below in this section. Let us return to the earlier matters, how the computation of “evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred,” fits exactly with the time commencing from the descent to Egypt to terminate at the end of 1,290 years until the day that the daily sacrifice was abolished: 210 years they were in Egypt. 480 years transpired from the Exodus until the building of the Temple. 410 years the Temple existed. 70 years was the Babylonian exile. 420 years the Second Temple stood. 1,290 should be added until the end of days, totaling: 2,880. Subtract six years that the daily sacrifice was removed before the destruction, for Scripture counted 1,290 years only from the time that the daily sacrifice was removed. Here you have the computation of “evening and morning, and 2,300” added to the computation. Fortunate is he who waits and reaches the end of days 45 years over 1,290 [years]. We may say that the king Messiah will come according to the first computation, and he will subsequently be concealed from them for forty-five years. Rabbi Elazar HaKalir established (in the concluding poem of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): in the foundation of his song: six weeks of years, totaling 42. We may say that the three years that did not total a week of years he did not count. And I found it so in Midrash Ruth that the king Messiah is destined to be concealed for forty-five years after he reveals himself, and proof is brought from these verses.

<b>In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus</b> This is not the Ahasuerus of the days of Haman, for he was the king of Persia, whereas this one was Darius the Mede who was crowned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans when Belshazzar was slain, as is written above (6:1): “And Darius the Mede took (sic) the kingdom.”
@2
<b>Contemplated the calculations</b> Heb. בִּינֹתִי בַּסְפָרִים.
<b>the number of the years, etc.</b> I contemplated the calculation of the years, for I thought about what Zeremiah (29:10) prophesied: “For at the completion of seventy years of Babylon I will remember you,” and I thought that this remembrance is the building of the Temple, and that the seventy years end in the first year of Darius the Mede, since the kingdom of Babylon stretched forth a hand upon Israel, when Nebuchadnezzar vanquished Jehoiakim to be his slave. Now that was in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, as the master said (Meg. 11b): “In the first year he conquered Nineveh; in the second year he went up and vanquished Jehoiakim.” Figure from that year until now, and you will find them [the 70 years]. This calculation is found also in the Mishnah of Seder Olam (ch. 28), and we learned there that in the year of Belshazzar’s death were 70 years from the day that Nebuchadnezzar ascended the throne: seventy minus one since the day that he conquered Jehoiakim, and yet one more year for Babylon, which Darius completed. And when I [Daniel] saw that the redemption was not hastening to come, I contemplated and put my heart to the calculation, and I knew that I should not have counted according to the conquest of Jehoiakim but [according] to the destruction of Jerusalem, when 70 years will be complete from the exile of Zedekiah, when Jerusalem was destroyed. And there are yet 18 years to come, for this exile was in the eighteenth year counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, as we learned in Seder Olam: “They were exiled in the seventh year; they were exiled in the eighth year; they were exiled in the eighteenth year; they were exiled in the nineteenth year.” Our Sages in Tractate Megillah (11b) explained that they were exiled in the exile of Jeconiah in the seventh year, counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, which is the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. They were exiled a second time in the eighteenth year, counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, which is the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign.

<b>Seventy weeks [of years] have been decreed</b> on Jerusalem from the day of the first destruction in the days of Zedekiah until it will be [destroyed] the second time.
<b>to terminate the transgression and to end sin</b> so that Israel should receive their complete retribution in the exile of Titus and his subjugation, in order that their transgressions should terminate, their sins should end, and their iniquities should be expiated, in order to bring upon them eternal righteousness and to anoint upon them (sic) the Holy of Holies: the Ark, the altars, and the holy vessels, which they will bring to them through the king Messiah. The number of seven weeks is four hundred and ninety years. The Babylonian exile was seventy [years] and the Second Temple stood four hundred and twenty [years].
@25
<b>And you shall know and understand from the emergence of the word</b> From the emergence of this word, which emerged at the beginning of your supplications to tell you, you shall know to understand [how] to restore and build Jerusalem.
<b>until the anointed king</b> Time will be given from the day of the destruction until the coming of Cyrus, king of Persia, about whom the Holy One, blessed be He, said that he would return and build His city, and He called him His anointed and His king, as it says (Isa. 45:1): “So said the Lord to His anointed one, to Cyrus etc.” (verse 13): “He shall build My city and free My exiles, etc.”
<b>seven weeks</b> Seven complete shemittah cycles they will be in exile before Cyrus comes, and there were yet three more years, but since they did not constitute a complete shemittah cycle, they were not counted. In the one year of Darius, in which Daniel was standing when this vision was said to him, seventy years from the conquest of Jehoiakim terminated. Deduct eighteen years from them, in which the conquest of Jehoiakim preceded the destruction of Jerusalem, leaving fifty-two years. This is what our Rabbis learned (Yoma 54a): “For fifty-two years no one passed through Judea.” They are the fifty-two years from the day of the destruction until they returned in the days of Cyrus. Hence, we have seven shemittah cycles and three years.
<b>and in sixty-two weeks it will return and be built</b> i.e., the city with its streets.
<b>and moat</b> Heb. וְחָרוּץ. They are the moats that they make around the wall to strengthen the city, which are called fosse in French, ditch or moat.
<b>but in troubled times</b> But in those times they will be troubled and distressed, for in the subjugation of the kings of Persia and the heathens, they will burden them with harsh bondage. Now although there are sixty-two weeks and four years more that remain from the eighth week, whose beginning, viz. the three years, was included in the fifty-two years of the duration of the exile, those four years were not counted here because here he counted only weeks, and you find that from the beginning he started to count seventy weeks, and at the end, when he delineated their times and their judgments, he counted only sixty-nine, proving that one week was divided, part of it here and part of it there; and he mentioned only whole weeks.
<b>but in troubled times</b> They will be troubled in those times.
@26

<b>the anointed one will be cut off</b> Agrippa, the king of Judea, who was ruling at the time of the destruction, will be slain.

<b>and his end will come about by inundation</b> And his end will be damnation and destruction, for He will inundate the power of his kingdom through the Messiah, and until the end of the wars of Gog the city will exist.
<b>cut off into desolation</b> a destruction of desolation.
@27
<b>And he will strengthen a covenant for the princes for one week</b> לָרַבִּים, for the princes, like “and all the officers of (רַבֵּי) the king,” in the Book of Jeremiah (39:13).
<b>will strengthen</b> Titus [will strengthen] a covenant with the princes of Israel.
<b>for one week</b> He will promise them the strengthening of a covenant and peace for seven years, but within the seven years, he will abrogate his covenant.
<b>he will abolish sacrifice and meal-offering</b> This is what he says in the first vision (8: 26): “and in tranquility he will destroy many.” Through a covenant of tranquility, he will destroy them.
<b>and on high, among abominations will be the dumb one</b> This is a pejorative for pagan deities. i.e., on a high place, among abominations and disgusting things, he will place the dumb one, the pagan deity, which is dumb like a silent stone.
<b>high</b> Heb. כְּנַף, lit. wing, an expression of height, like the wing of a flying bird.
<b>and until destruction and extermination befall the dumb one</b> and the ruling of the abomination will endure until the day that the destruction and extermination decreed upon it [will] befall it, in the days of the king Messiah.
<b>befall the dumb one</b> Heb. תִּתַּךְ, reach; and total destruction will descend upon the image of the pagan deity and upon its worshippers.

Now this word is not a noun, like (Job. 38:4): “if you know understanding (בִּינָה) Instead, the “hey” is superfluous, and it is like (Ps 5:2) “understand (בִּינָה) my thoughts” Therefore, the accent is above on the “beth,” and its meaning is like הָבֵן, understand.

<b>three weeks of days</b> twenty-one years. They are eighteen years from the one year of Darius the Mede, when he [Daniel] put to his heart to calculate the seventy years of the exile, as it is written: until the second year of Darius the Persian, the son of Esther, who built the Temple. As for the three extra years, I do not know whether he started to fast before them or whether the duration of the acceptance of the vow of his fasts terminated three years after the building.

Alexander of Macedon will rise, for although Israel was subjugated by the kings of Persia in those days, they exacted a light tribute from them, and they did not burden them heavily because the Holy One, blessed be He, caused them to have mercy on them.

<b>and it will be divided to the four directions of the heavens</b> It is written in the book of Ben Gorion (ch. 14) that he divided his kingdom between the four heads of his family; they are the four heads of the leopard that Daniel saw (above 7:6): “And behold another one, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird on its back, and the beast had four heads.” He gave this one dominion in the east, this one in the west, this one in the north and this one in the south, and so in the first vision (8:8): “an appearance of four sprouted in its stead,” concerning the horns of the he-goat.
<b>but not to his posterity</b> The dominion will not come to his sons but to his family members. [The word] אַחֲרִיתוֹ coincides only with the expression of sons, and so Scripture states (Amos 4:2): “and you shall be borne on shields and your posterity (אַחֲרִיתְכֶן) in fishing boats,” which Jonathan renders: and your sons (sic) and daughters in fishermen’s boats.

The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction, which equals 1584. Add 1290, and the total sum is 2874; like the numerical value of בֹּקֶר עֶרֶב [574] plus 2300 [2874].

<b>And in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia</b> This book is arranged as a continuation of the Book of Daniel, as is explained in Baba Bathra (15a), and the word [וּבְשְׁנַת] refers back from this [book] to that one, for it is stated in Daniel (9:2): “In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, contemplated the calculations of the number of the years that the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah the prophet from the destruction of Jerusalem, seventy years.” And so the entire chapter proceeds to relate [the story] of the destruction of the Temple, the time of the Babylonian exile, and his confession, in which he confessed Israel’s sin. The beginning of this book is as follows: After Belshazzar was assassinated, Darius the Mede reigned, as it says (Dan. 6:1): “And Darius the Mede received the kingdom etc.” and after Darius’ death, this Cyrus, the king of Persia, reigned, and in the first year of his reign, the seventy years for the remembrance of the Babylonian exile, [counting] from the day that Jehoiakim was exiled, were completed, as it says (Jer. 29:10): “At the completion of seventy years of Babylon, I will remember you etc.” When Israel returned from the Babylonian exile to the land of Israel, in that year, in the first year of Cyrus, Israel laid the foundation of the Temple, and the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin slandered them to Cyrus, the king of Persia, and he commanded [them] to curtail the work, no longer to build the edifice of the Temple; and the Israelites were idle, for they did not build the Temple during the entire reign of Cyrus and Ahasuerus, who succeeded him, until the second year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, the king of Persia, who was Darius, the son of Esther. And in the second year of his reign, they began building the Temple until the building was completed. And from the first year of Cyrus until the second year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus the king of Persia, in whose days the Temple was built, were eighteen years, to fulfill what was said (Dan. 9:2): “from the destruction of Jerusalem, seventy years etc.” And now, in the second year of Darius, seventy years had elapsed since the destruction of Jerusalem; [i.e.,] the destruction of the Temple, when Zedekiah was exiled. From the exile of Jehoiakim until the exile of Zedekiah, when the Temple was destroyed, were eighteen years, and now in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, seventy years since the exile of Jehoiakim, when Israel was exiled to Babylon, were completed, and thereby the verse that states (Jer. 29:10): “for at the completion of seventy years of Babylon I will remember you etc.” was fulfilled. And this is the remembrance, that Israel returned to their soil and built the foundation of the building of the Temple, although it was not yet completed. We find that there were fifty-two years from the exile of Zedekiah, when the Temple was destroyed, until the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia; and eighteen years after the first year of Cyrus, which is the second year of Darius, when Israel commenced to build the edifice, and they completed it. This is proven in Seder Olam (ch. 29), in Tractate Megillah (11b) and in this book, as I explained.
<b>at the completion of the word of the Lord from the mouth of Jeremiah</b> at the time that the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, which Jeremiah spoke, was completed, as it says (Jer. 29:10): “for at the completion of seventy years of Babylon etc.”

@63
<b>Hattirshatha</b> That is Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah (Neh. 8:9), and our Rabbis said (Yerushalmi Kid. 4:1) that he was named Hattirshatha because the Sages permitted him (הָתֵּר) to drink (שָּׁתָּא) wine of gentiles because he was the king’s butler.

<b>until a priest arises, etc.</b> like a person who says to his friend, “Until the Messiah comes, this matter will not come about.” I cannot interpret it to mean: until a priest arises for the Urim and Tumim in the Second Temple, because we find in Yoma, chapter 1 (21b) that the Urim and Tumim were missing in the Second Temple.
@64
<b>The entire congregation together</b> When they were all together with the priests, the Levites and the Nethinim, they amounted to this number; and the Children of Israel counted above were of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, and those missing from this number, which you will not find above, were of the other tribes. So it is explained in Seder Olam (ch. 29): “‘The entire congregation together was forty-two thousand etc.’ But if you add them up, they are only thirty thousand. Where are the thirteen thousand? They ascended from the other tribes.”

@3
<b>And they set the altar on its bases</b> in order to offer up sacrifices upon it, because they were afraid of the peoples of the land, lest they taunt them and lest they slander them to the king. And they built the altar to offer up burnt offerings upon it, in order that the peoples hear and understand the matter, that they did it with the sanction of the king and therefore they would hesitate to taunt them about the building of the Temple.

<b>to the sea of Jaffa</b> By way of the sea they would bring them.
<b>according to the sanction of</b> Heb. כְּרִשְׁיוֹן as the sanction of the king was upon them to build the Temple. כְּרִשְׁיוֹן is an expression of permission (רְשּׁוּת) derived from רשּׁה ; since from אבה to want, he says [i.e., derives] אֶבְיוֹן, a needy person; and from צבה, to desire, צִבְיוֹן, desire; and from חזה to see, חִזָיוֹן, a vision; and from רעה, רַעְיוֹן, thought; from חבה, חֶבְיוֹן, hiding; and from רשּׁה, he says רְשּׁוּת, permission; like from, ענה, עֱנוּת, affliction; and from שּׁבה, שְּׁבוּת,captivity; and from ראה, רְאוּת, a sight; and from זנה, זְנוּת, harlotry. The result is that רְשּׁוּת and רִשְׁיוֹן are derived from the same root according to the gauge of grammar, and they are the same expression. Menahem, (p. 34) however, associated it with (Ps. 21:3): “and the speech of his lips (וַַַַַאֲרֶשֶּׁת),” but he was not exact with its root. Nevertheless, these two manners [of defining words] are close to each other in their meanings.

@10
<b>And...laid the foundation</b> וְיִסְדוּ This is the strong conjugation of יְסוֹד, like (Ezek. 25:4): “and they will settle (וְיִשְּׁבוּ) their palaces.” Just as וְיִשְּׁבוּ is derived from ישּׁב so is וְיִסְדוּ derived from יסד, and their meaning is, וְיִסְדוּ וְיִשְּׁבוּ in the intensive conjugation with two “yud”s, one for the [continuous] action and one for the radical, and their meaning is that they were laying the foundation, they were settling.
<b>And the builders laid the foundation</b> And the builders were laying the foundation [see above] of the Temple of the Lord at the time [that] they were harmonizing in their song, and they stationed the priests attired with elegant garments with trumpets in their hands to sound them.

~Nehemiah

@1
<b>The words of Nehemiah, etc.</b> Nehemiah wrote this book from here on.
<b>the twentieth year</b> This refers to the twentieth year of King Darius, who is identical with Artaxerxes. In Tractate Rosh Hashanah (3a, b), we find that the phrase “the twentieth year” is mentioned twice using similar wording [to teach us that it is speaking of the identical year]. It states below (2:1), “And it came to pass in the month of Nissan of the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, etc.” The years were calculated from the month of Tishrei. It says here, “And it was in the month of Kislev of the twentieth year, etc.” This refers to the Kislev coming after Tishrei. Further down it says (2:1), “And it was in the month of Nissan of the twentieth year, etc.” This refers to the Nissan of the same year. And I cannot explain that they calculated their years from the month of Nissan and that the incident mentioned below: “And it was in the month of Nissan, etc.” occurred before this incident: “And it was in the month of Kislev, etc.” It is true that events [in the Torah] are not necessarily recorded in chronological order. Nevertheless, the chapters indicate that the second chapter took place only because of the events of the first chapter.

<b>Adam, Seth, Enosh</b> Ezra wrote this book of genealogy through Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi during the eighteen years from the name that Zerubbabel and Joshua the Priest came to Jerusalem in the days of Cyrus I until Cyrus the son of Esther came. All of this [book] is for the [purpose of tracing the] lineage of King David and the Levites for gate sentries, guards, and singers, how David stationed them in their positions, and the priests in their watches. Therefore, he traced their lineage from Adam to Abraham, and since he had to trace Abraham’s lineage, he mentioned also the rest of the nations, his sons and his grandsons, and because of his sons, he had to trace the lineage of the rest of the nations, the sons of Canaan, to let [us] know how Abraham inherited their land. And since he had to mention and trace the lineage of the generations of Canaan, he mentioned together with them (the generations of) the rest of the nations, but he mentions them only briefly and casts them away until he reaches the main ones, as is explained in <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> (39:10) (See also <i>Tanhuma Veyesheb</i> 1). This can be compared to a king who was traveling from place to place and dropped a pearl. The king stood and sifted the sand with a sieve until he found the pearl. So said the Holy One, blessed be He, “Why should I trace the lineage of Shem and Arpachshad and Terach except to find Abraham?” [As it is written] (Neh. 9:8): “... and You found his heart faithful [before You].” And because of the honor of Isaac, he traced the lineage of the sons of Esau and Ishmael and the sons of Keturah, and he cast them away little by little and left them. He mentions the sons of Seir because the sons of Esau inherited them [i.e., their territory]; he also traces the lineage of Timna, who became a concubine to the seed of Abraham, to let us know the praise of Abraham, for she was the daughter of princes and chiefs and wished to be a concubine to the seed of Abraham, as it is written (Gen. 36:22): “... and Lotan’s sister was Timna,” and it is written (ibid. 12): “And Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz the son of Esau,” because she said, “If I am not worthy to marry him, I shall be his concubine.” (<i>Gen. Rabbah</i> 84: 14, <i>Sanh.</i> 99b) Moreover, for this reason, he traced the lineage of the sons of Seir because they were chiefs and princes, and Mount Seir belonged to Seir, but out of love for Isaac, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave it to Esau, as it is written (Deut. 2:12): “... and the children of Esau drove them out, etc., and settled in their place,” and to inform us of the fulfillment of the words of the Holy One, blessed be He, Who promised Isaac that He would multiply his seed and give him dominion over all, and because of the honor of Isaac he likewise wrote (verse. 31): “Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, etc.”
<b>Adam, Seth, Enosh</b> This is to be interpreted like: “The sons of Adam: Seth, and the sons of Seth: Enosh,” but since they were not the main part of the genealogy, he states them briefly, and he does not mention Cain and Abel because they did not beget generations, but from Seth emerged the generations of Noah and Abraham, and from Abraham to David.
@4
<b>Noah, Shem, Ham</b> He should have counted the sons of Shem immediately to find the pearl, namely Abraham, etc., until David, but he mentions the unimportant one and treats his lineage briefly and takes hold of the main ones; and so is the method of all this genealogy of Chronicles, and so it is in the section immediately following (verses 28f.): “The sons of Abraham: Isaac and Ishmael. These are their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael was Nebaioth.” And so: (verses 34f.): “And Abraham begot Isaac; the sons of Isaac: Esau and Israel; the sons of Esau: Eliphaz,” where he mentions first the lineage of the unimportant ones and afterwards the main one.
@6
<b>Ashkenaz and Diphath</b> (with a “daleth”), but in the Pentateuch it is written (Gen. 10:3): “... and Riphath,” because in the beginning they were weak (רָפִים), and they did not overpower Israel, but at the end they were filled with disgrace (דֹּפִי) and evil.
@7
<b>And the sons of Javan: Elisha</b> The reason he did not mention Magog and Madai is that he mentioned only the lineage of these, but he did not mention the sons of Magog or the sons of Madai or the rest because heads of nations did not emerge from them, but all their nations were called by the name of Kittim and Dodanim.
<b>and Rodanim</b> And further (Gen. 10:4) Scripture states: “and Dodanim.” When Israel sins, they come and rule over them (רוֹדִים), but when Israel is in power, they say, “You are the sons of our uncles (דּוֹדֵינוּ).” At first they appeared as friends when it was for their own benefit, but later they subjugated them.

<b>And Mitzraim begot Ludim</b> In <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> (37:5) “Said Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: The entire coinage of Mizraim is only in the sea. Said Rabbi Joshua ben Korhah: ‘Ludim’ is written ‘Ludiim’ in chronicles, with two ‘yuds,’ to tell you that ‘Ludiim’ means לוּדֵי יָם, Ludim of the sea; Anamim, Anamim of the sea; Lehabim, Lehabim of the sea; Naphtuhim, Naphtuhim of the sea.”

@13
<b>And Canaan begot, etc.</b> They are eleven, and with Canaan they are twelve. This is what is written: “He set up the boundaries of the peoples.” He set up the boundaries of the peoples corresponding to the tribes of Israel, for they too are twelve; corresponding to the tribes of Israel, He set up the boundaries of the peoples, on the pattern of (Gen. 21:29): “... that you set up (הִצַּבְתָּ) by themselves.”

<b>the earth was parted</b> The days of the people were divided and diminished, for at first people lived nine hundred years or more, and in the days of Arpachshad and thereafter, [they were diminished] to four hundred years or more, and from Peleg and thereafter, they were divided in half, to two hundred years out of those four hundred years.

<b>And the sons of Midian: Ephah and Epher, etc.</b> five heads of nations. Therefore, they appointed five kings, each one its king, as it is written (Num. 31:8): “Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, etc., the five kings of Midian.”

<b>Hamran and Eshban</b> But in the Pentateuch (Gen. 36:26) it is written, “Hemdan.” At first, they were precious and desirable (חֲמוּדִין וְנֶחֱמָדִין) as righteous men, but at the end they were as ugly as a donkey. So is the way of a donkey: at first it is pretty and at the end it becomes ugly, but a horse is at first ugly and later pretty.
@43
<b>Now these are the kings</b> It is explained (<i>Gen. Rab.</i> 83:2): Rabbi Aibu said: This was before a king reigned in Israel, but since a king reigned in Israel, a governor reigned in Edom. Rabbi Jose the son of Hanina says: When this one [Edom] appoints kings, this one [Israel] appoints judges; when this one appoints chiefs, this one appoints princes. Said Rabbi Joshua the son of Levi: This one [Edom] appointed eight [kings] and this one: [Israel] appointed eight [kings], and I heard [people ask]: Did Edom have only these eight kings, and did Israel have only eight? Were there not more? Joram, Ahaziah, Joash, etc. Rather, the statement that this one appointed eight kings means that when they [Edom] appointed those eight kings of Edom, they [Israel] did not appoint the kings of Israel, because they were before David.

<b>and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara</b> They all lived at the time of David and at the time of Solomon, and they were exceedingly wise. Concerning this it says (I Kings 5:11): “And he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol.” Further on, regarding Solomon’s wisdom, the expression is “Darda,” for even though it was called the generation of knowledge (דֵּעָה דּוּר) because of its wisdom, Solomon was wiser than all of them. Now when Scripture says הָאֶזְרָחִי, the “aleph” is superfluous, like הַזַּרְחִי (Num. 26:20), [because] he was descended from Zerah, and in many places, the “aleph” is inserted into the word, and is not pronounced, e.g. (Job. 13:17): “and my speech (וְאַחְוָתִי)” (Isa. 19:6): “And they shall abandon (וְהֶאֶזְנִיחוּ).” And likewise, (Num. 11:4): “וְְהָאסַפְסוּף, and the rabble.” Now sometimes it is completely missing, as (II Sam. 19:14): “תֹמְרוּ, you shall say,” and likewise, (II Chron. 22:5): “... and the Arameans (הָרַמִּים) smote.” [The verse in Kings] is expounded by <i>Pesikta</i> (<i>Peskikta d’Rav Kahana</i> p. 34, <i>Pesikta Rabbathi</i> 14:9): “... than all men this refers to Adam. Ethan is Abraham. Heman is Moses. Calcol is Joseph. Darda is the generation of the desert. Mahol means that He forgave them for making the Calf.”
@7
<b>And the sons of Carmi: Achar</b> Now why do I call him Achar? Was his name not Achan? (It is explained) that [he was called thus] since he troubled Israel by transgressing the devoted thing, and because of him thirty-six thousand (sic) men fell. This is what I explained that whatever derogatory information he can tell, he tells, (but nevertheless) the kingship emanated from them.

<b>And the sons of Ethan: Azariah</b> Like (Gen. 46:23): “And the sons of Dan: Hushim.”

<b>and Celubai</b> This is Caleb as is indicated below (v. 18): “And Caleb the son of Hezron,” and in I Sam. (25:3), it says: “... and he was a Calebite,” (כָלְבִּי), which the Targum renders: “of the house of Caleb,” and so he explains the word: כָלְבִּי, that he (Nabal) held himself [superior] and boasted that there was no one of such high lineage as he in the entire tribe; i.e, if Samuel gave him (David) the throne, the throne will come to me. Therefore, he said, (ibid. v. 10): “Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? Nowadays, there are many slaves,” for he is descended from Ruth the Moabitess, and Jerahmeel his brother married a gentile woman, as is written below, and that is the meaning of “Celubai,” he was haughty and proud (with everythng); his heart exalted him.
@10
<b>Nahshon, the prince of the children of Judah</b> He explains this only because of David’s honor.
@11
<b>and Salma begot Boaz</b> Our Sages stated (<i>Baba Bathra</i> 91a): “Ibzan is Boaz,” but it is amazing because how can this be? Did not Nahshon die in the second year following the Exodus from Egypt? Now Salmon, his son, had already been born, and he was one of those who entered the land, and Boaz, his son, who was Ibzan, was born when he entered the land. Now from the Exodus from Egypt until Jephthah were three hundred years, and the Sages said that when Boaz was intimate with Ruth and she conceived, Boaz died immediately, and Ibzan was a judge after the death of Jephthah, as it is written (Judg. 12:8): “And after him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.” About this I am amazed, for we find concerning Abram, that he said, “After his blood had become clotted, etc.,” and he said, (Gen. 17: 17): “Shall a child be born to [a man who is] a hundred years old?” So how did Boaz beget [a child] at the age of three hundred? It is possible to say that for this reason Scripture says (Ruth 4:13): “... and the Lord gave her conception,” on the pattern of “... and the Lord blessed him.” (Ibzan - The father of all the cold ones, for a young woman lay beside him, and he became cold and did not touch her. Not appearing in some editions.)
@13

@17
<b>Jether the Ishmaelite</b> And in II Sam. (17:25) it says, “the Israelite.” He lived in the land of Ishmael, on the pattern of (ibid. 6:11): “the house of Obed Edom the Gittite,” and so, (I Ki. 7: 13f.): “And King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. He (was) a widow’s son... and his father was a man of Tyre.”
@18
<b>And Caleb the son of Hezron begot Azubah Ishah</b> Because he had a wife named Azubah, he named his daughter Azubah Ishah, as it is written (v. 19): “... and Azubah died, and Caleb took to himself Ephrath.” From here is deduced that he had a wife named Azubah.
@19
<b>and she bore him Hur</b>
@20
<b>And Hur begot Uri, and Uri begot Bezalel</b> Figure that each of them was less than eight years old when they begot, for Caleb was forty years old during the episode of the spies, as it is written (Jos. 14: 7): “I was forty years old when [Moses, the servant of the Lord] sent, etc.,” and at that time they all were already born, for the Tabernacle that Bezalel made had been erected. Caleb was eight years old when he begot Azuba Ishah, nine years old when he begot Jerioth, and after the death of Azubah, his wife, he took Ephrath, and she bore him Hur in the following year, making him ten years old, and Hur was eight years old when he begot Uri, and Uri was eight years old when he begot Bezalel, thus making 26 years, and it is written (Exod. 36:1): “and every wise hearted man,” and a man is not less than thirteen years old. So Bezalel was thirteen years old when he made the Tabernacle. Thus, we have forty years less one. We find that each one of them was less than eight years old when they begot children, and so it is explained in Chapter “<i>Ben sorer umoreh</i>“ (<i>Sanh.</i> 69a). According to the Midrash, they begot at the age of six.
@21
<b>And afterwards Hezron came to the daughter of Machir</b> This was because of David’s honor, because Hezron came to the daughter of Machir, taking her as a concubine, not for matrimony, similar to (Ps. 51:2): “... when he came to Bathsheba,” and he was sixty years old, thus making two uncomplimentary qualities for Machir’s daughter: one, that he did not take her for the purpose of matrimony, and one, that he was old, but because of the esteem of the families of Judah, they gave her to him, and when Jair begot [children], Machir’s sons gave him twenty-three cities to take one of his daughters as a wife.
@23
<b>And Geshur and Aram took</b> Geshur represents the Geshurites and the Maacathites because they were near the Arameans, who dwelt in the east of the land of Israel, and Aram dwelt in the east, as it is written (Isa. 9:11): “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west.” During the period of the Judges (Jud. 3:8), when Israel sinned, He (God) delivered them into the hands of the enemy, into the hands of Aram, and then (these) went and took them from them, and when David came, he restored them, and because he restored them, Scripture mentioned them here.

<b>And the sons of Jerahmeel, the firstborn of Hezron were</b> Since he interrupted with the family of Caleb, he had to say, “the first born Hezron,” the firstborn of Jerahmeel.
@26
<b>Now Jerahmeel had another wife whose name was Atarah</b> According to the simple meaning of the verse, she was an Israelitess, but in <i>Yebamoth</i> of the Palestinian Talmud (this is not found in our editions of <i>Yebamoth</i>, but in <i>Yer. Sanh.</i> 2:3) it is written that he took a gentile woman with whom to crown himself (עֲטָרָה). She was a beautiful princess.
<b>she was the mother of Onam</b> (I heard) that “mother” is like (Judg. 5:7): “I arose as a mother in Israel.” And she was the mother of Onam, and Onam is an expression meaning that he was humble and weak, an expression of mourning (אוֹנֵן), and like (Deut. 26:14): “I have not eaten of it in my mourning (בְאֹנִי),” and like (Num. 11:1): “... were as if in mourning over themselves (כְּמִתְאוֹנְנִים)” Sheshan, who gave his daughter to his Egyptian slave, Jarha, was descended from him, and [the Chronicler] tells of their disgrace; that is to say, they were not deserving of the kingship, and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who assassinated Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, was descended from him (Jer. 41:1).
@34
<b>And Sheshan had no sons but daughters</b> And that which he says above (verse 31): “... and the sons of Sheshan were Ahlai,” means that he [Ahlai] was ill and humble and died without children.
@35
<b>And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his slave for a wife</b> From here they derived that if your daughter has matured, free your slave and give him to her (<i>Pes.</i> 113a), and from here the Sages derived in the Palestinian Talmud, Tractate <i>Yebamoth</i> (source unknown): “Do not trust a proselyte until fifteen generations, and fifteen generations are from Ittai the Egyptian until Ishmael, and some say sixteen generations, including Jarha.” The midrash states the following: “Is it possible that he was of the royal descent (מִזֶּרַע הַמְלוּכָה) [as in Jeremiah 41:1]? Now was not Ishmael of the seed of Jerahmeel and not from Ram? But rather it means that he passed his seed to the molech.”
@42
<b>And the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel</b> Since he traced the lineage of part of the family of Caleb and interrupted in the lineage of Jerahmeel, it was necessary to say that Caleb was the brother of Jerahmeel, that this was not another Caleb. This is the manner of the entire genealogy: he does not trace lineages in sequence. He traces the lineage of part of such and such a family; he goes on to other families, and when he has completed part of this family, he goes back to tracing the lineage of the first family, and then returns to the other one, and the entire book of genealogy is mixed.
<b>he was the father of Ziph</b> The ruler of Ziph, the ruler of all the inhabitants of Mareshah, and the ruler of Hebron, and the names of these towns are mentioned in the Book of Joshua (15:24, 44, 54), as it is written: “Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth, etc.” (And it is written there:) “And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah, and Hebron (sic).”

@50
<b>These were the sons of Caleb, the son of Hur, the firstborn of Ephrathah</b> The interpretation is: These were the sons of Caleb. בֶּן חוּר is like בְּנוֹ חוּר, his son was Hur, and that Hur was the firstborn of Ephrath, his wife, not the firstborn of Caleb, and so it is explained above (verse 19): “And Caleb took to himself Ephrath, and she bore him Hur.” Another explanation [is that] “for these were the sons of, etc.” Hur was Caleb’s son, and he begot a son whom he named Caleb, and this is its explanation: And these were the sons of Caleb the son of Hur: Shobal, etc.

Do not wonder that it is written (Judg. 13:25): “And the spirit of the Lord began to come upon him at times [in the camp of Dan] between Zorah and Eshtaol,” which means that these two towns belonged to the Danites, [which presents a difficulty] because all these stated here belonged to the Judahites. We can say [to solve this discrepancy that] the towns and the boundary that were between Zorah and Eshtaol belonged to Dan, but Zorah and Eshtaol themselves belonged to the Judahites.

Therefore, David called him by two names: Chileab and Daniel. Daniel God judged him (sic); Chileab he resembles his father.

<b>and Eljada and Eliphelet</b> In II Sam. (5:16) Scripture counts Eliphelet only once and counts only seven [sons], but here, he counts nine. The reason is that his son Eliphelet died, and another son was born to him later who was likewise named Eliphelet. He is the one counted there, and also Elishama. Elishama he counts here twice. We can say similarly that he died and another son was born to him, and also one of these died and seven remained. For this reason, he counts there only seven, and the nine that he counts here are for David’s honor, that he had many sons, for indeed the entire Book was written because of the honor of David and his posterity.

<b>Ahaziah his son, Joash</b> From Solomon to Joash were eight generations, and since David foresaw that his seed would perish in the days of Joash through Athaliah, as is written in this Book (II Chron. 22:10): “... she arose and destroyed (וַתְּדַבֵּר),” (from the expression of דֶּבֶר pestilence, through poison), he stood in prayer and uttered a psalm (Ps. 12): “For the conductor on the sheminith,” [alluding to an] eight stringed [instrument] (other editions: in number) “for the eighth generation.” (v. 2): “Save, O Lord, for the pious are gone, etc.” And Joash escaped, and from Joash to Josiah are eight generations, for David foresaw that Josiah and his sons would all go to their doom: this one was slain [i.e., Josiah. Perhaps he means Jehoiakim and Zedekiah’s sons as well] and this one’s eyes were gouged out [Zedekiah]. And he [David] prayed again on the sheminith, for the eighth generation (Ps. 6:1f.): “O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger,” and because of his prayer, the sons of Jehoiakim survived, and throughout the entire Book of Psalms, there are only these two mentions of the sheminith. And from Jeconiah (other editions: Jehoiakim) until (verse 24): “Anani seven,” which is [an allusion to] the King Messiah, as it is written: (Dan. 7:13): “... and behold, with the clouds of (עֲנָנֵי) the heavens,” are thirty eight sons, including both sons and generations of the sons. The Holy One, blessed be He, did this because he [David] recited thirty eight praises to Him, as it is written in the Book of Ezra (sic) (I Chron. 29:10 13). From “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, etc.” until “and to strengthen,” are thirty eight words.

<b>The sons of Simeon</b> Since Simeon dwelt in Judah’s territory, he traces his lineage first and mentions his towns before those of Reuben.
@27
<b>but his brothers did not have many sons and all their family did not multiply as much as the children of Judah</b> They did not have as many children as the children of Judah. Since they were few, and Judah’s territory was too large for them, Judah accepted Simeon in its territory, because Simeon had no share in the land of Israel, as it says (Gen. 49:7): “I shall divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel,” and we learned in <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> (<i>Shittah Hadashah</i>): “I shall divide them among the Children of Israel to station scribes in Israel in the synagogues, etc.” Now how do we know that they agreed [to give them a share of their territory]? For it is written (Jos. 19:9): “Out of the lot of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon, for the portion of the children of Judah was too large for them; therefore the children of Simeon inherited in the midst of their inheritance,” lest the beasts of the field outnumber them. Now as regards the verse (ibid. v. 1): “And the second lot came out to Simeon,” this is what happened: They cast lots to choose which tribe would accept Simeon in its territory, and the lot fell upon the territory of Judah. And the meaning of the verse (Jud. 1:3): “And Judah said to Simeon his brother: Come up with me into my lot, and we will fight against the Canaanites, and I will also go with you into your lot,” refers to “the lot I have given you.”
@28

This is the meaning of what is written: “... these were their cities until David reigned,” but when he reigned, he drove them out. [I heard this] from Rabbi Eliezer the son of Meshullam of blessed memory, and so did Rabbi Solomon the son of Levi, the brother of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan explain it.

<b>And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel</b> Now if you ask: since he was the firstborn, why did the kingship not emanate from him? He was indeed the firstborn, but when he desecrated his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph. Now if you ask, if so, why did the sons of Joseph not reign? He therefore says, “but not to be reckoned in the genealogy as the first born,” [i.e., the sons of Joseph were not meant] to take the share of the kingship, but only the birthright, because Judah was the most fit to reign even if Reuben had not defiled the birthright and it had not been taken from him.

But when they came into Israel’s hands, they changed their names, as it is written (Num. 32:38): “Nebo and Baal Meon their names being changed,” i.e., Israel changed their names, but Sibmah, since it was not named for their pagan deities, they did not change its name. In <i>Megillah</i> (unknown) it is explained that Nebo and Baal Meon are names of pagan deities.

<b>he is the one who served in the Temple that Solomon built</b> Some explain that Azariah was the first Azariah, and from Azariah to Seraiah, who lived at the time of the destruction of the Temple, were eight priests. Accordingly, they emended in <i>Yoma</i> in the first chapter (9a), and in <i>Leviticus Rabbah</i> (21:9), and in <i>Siphre</i>, <i>parashath Phineas</i> (Num. 25:12), that eight high priests served in the First Temple. Some say that there were eighteen. But neither one is a viable theory because Zadok was the first who ministered in the time of Solomon. Moreover, which Amariah was in the days of Jehoshaphat, about whom it is written (II Chron 19:11): “... and behold, Amariah the head priest”? Now he was Amariah the son of Azariah, who lived in the days of Uzziah and in the days of Hezekiah, who was after Jehoshaphat. If you say [that it was] Azariah the father of Seraiah, then where was Hilkiah the High Priest who lived in the days of Josiah? Rather we must count from Zadok, and there were twelve priests from Zadok until Seraiah, and so we find in an exact version of <i>Leviticus Rabbah</i>. Now that which the Scripture writes: “... he was the one who served in the Temple,” is explained in <i>Sefer Yerushalmi</i> (source unknown. Perhaps <i>Sifre Zuta, Korah</i> 18:7 is meant) as follows: Did he alone serve, and did he serve in the days of Solomon? Did not other priests serve as well? But because he risked his life for the sanctity of the Temple by not allowing Uzziah to burn incense, it is said: “he was the one who served in the Temple that Solomon built,” and he was the Azariah who lived in the days of Uzziah (ibid. 26: 17, 20) and in the days of Hezekiah, and Azariah the son of Ahimaaz was Amariah the priest who served in the days of Jehoshaphat, just as Uzziah is called Azariah, as is written (II Ki. 15:1): “In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam etc, Azariah... became king.” And Azariah the son of Ahimaaz was called Zechariah, as it is written (II Chron. 26:5): “And he was wont to seek God in the days of Zechariah who understood the fear of God, etc.”
@41
<b>And Jehozadak went when the Lord exiled Judah and Jerusalem</b> And the verse in the Book of Haggai (1:1): “Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the [High] Priest,” does not [mean] that Jehozadak ever served in the high priesthood, for he was exiled to Babylon in the days of Jeconiah, as it is written: “And Jehozadak went when... exiled etc.,” but Joshua his son was the High Priest when they ascended from Babylon during the time of the Second Temple. Now why was Azariah the son of Seraiah the scholar not the High Priest, but [instead] his nephew Joshua the son of Jehozadak? This is the reason: because Joshua ascended with Zerubbabel many days and years before Ezra ascended.

You should know [that this is true] because it is written close by (9:1): “And all Israel traced their genealogy, and behold they are written in the book of the kings of Israel, and Judah was exiled to Babylon because of its treachery.” The meaning is that if you wish to know the genealogy of the Ten Tribes, go to Halah and Habor, the Gozan River, and the cities of Media, because their annals were exiled with them, but as for Judah I found their records in Babylon, and that which I found, I wrote.

Rabbi Levi says: It means that his daughters were beautiful and were married to [high] priests who were anointed with olive oil. Rabbi Simon says: [It means] that his daughters were beautiful and married to kings who were anointed with the anointment oil, and since they had plenty of oil, they [the daughters] would anoint themselves with it. Therefore, they were beautiful, for concerning Asher it is written (Deut. 33:24): ‘and dip his foot in oil,’ and Rabbi Hanina said: “The warm water and the oil with which my mother anointed me restored me to my youth.”

<b>And Benjamin begot Bela his firstborn</b> He already traced his genealogy (above 7:6-11), but since he wished to trace his genealogy until Saul, he commences to trace it from Benjamin. We read other names here and the entire genealogy above, and whoever wishes to study with exactitude the majority of the Levitic cities and the open land around them - they are in Joshua, because Ezra found various books.

<b>And Ahio, Shashak</b> All these were the sons of Elpaal. Another explanation, which is more correct, is that from “Ahio, Shashak” until “and Joha,” all these are the sons of Beriah, and from “Zebadiah” until “Jobab,” all these are the sons of Elpaal, and from “And Jakim,” until “and Shimrath,” all these are the sons of Shimei.

<b>And in Gibeon dwelt the leader of Gibeon</b> This section until (verse 38): “...all these were the sons of Azel,” is written twice in this Book. Also the section (9:2): “And the first settlers, who were in their inheritance in their cities,” and the section (9:10): “And of the priests: Jedaiah and Jehoirib” are likewise in the Book of Nehemiah, as it is written (11: 3): “And these are the heads of the province.” This is what is explained at the end of Megillath Yerushalmi. Ezra found scrolls: the scroll of מְעוֹנִים, the scroll of זַאַטוּטֵי and the scrolls of הָאַחִים, and they rejected the words of the one and accepted the words of the two. Likewise, they found many genealogical records. When they found three or five, they rejected the minority and accepted the majority. When they found an even number, e.g. “And in Gibeon dwelt the leader of Gibeon,” he had to write it twice because the order of their genealogy is not uniform, and likewise, [in] “the first settlers,” he found an even number, which differed one from the other. [Therefore], it was written twice: here and in his [Ezra’s] book. Now why did he not write both of them here, including those that are in Ezra: “And these are the heads of the province, etc.”? Because he traced the genealogy there until, “And these are the priests and the Levites,” and he traced the genealogy here until Jedaiah, who was after Ezra. Now what purpose would it have to explain and to trace the genealogy here in Chronicles, the generations and the genealogy after Ezra, except for those who were alive during the First Temple period?

Said Rabbi Isaac the son of Samuel of Narbonne: From the time that Israel worshipped the Baal, the Baal was called by the name of Bosheth (shame), as it is written (Jer. 11:13): “altars for the shameful thing, etc.,” for the Baal is a shameful thing. Gideon was called Jerubaal, based on the expression (Jud. 6:32): “Let Baal contend with him.” He was also called Jerubesheth, for it is written concerning Abimelech: “who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubesheth, etc.” in the Book of Samuel (II 11: 21). He is called Jerubesheth and Jerubaal, because Baal and Bosheth are synonymous.

<b>and the archers discovered him</b> Come and see that (Prov. 21:30): “... there is neither wisdom nor understanding, etc. against the Lord,” because man’s ways are before the Lord. Benjamin’s enemies would fall before them [when they used] the bow because they were well trained with the bow, as it is written: “[Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite,] a man with a shriveled right hand,” (Judges 3:15). And so it is written, concerning Jonathan (I Samuel 20:20): “And I shall shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a mark.” And it is written below (I Chron. 12:2) concerning Benjamin: “Armed with bows, shooting with the right and left hands, etc.” and concerning Asa in this Book (II 14:7): “... and out of Benjamin, who bore shields and drew bows, etc.” But when the Lord turned away from Saul [who was from the tribe of Benjamin], he fell into the hands of the archers, into something that was his own craft. and he was terrified of the archers וַיָחֶל like (Esther 4:4): “...and the queen was extremely terrified (וַתִּתְחַלְחַל).”

<b>and brought them to Jabesh</b> to Jabesh Gilead
<b>and they fasted seven days</b> Why did they imperil their lives more than the rest of Israel to remove the bodies of Saul and his sons from Mount Gilboa? Because Saul had done them a favor by saving them when Nahash the Ammonite marched upon them. [They fasted seven days] corresponding to the seven days that they [the Ammonites] gave them [to see] if a savior would come [to save] them, [at which time] they fasted seven days; perhaps a savior would come to them. Since Saul came and saved them, they fasted now too seven days, and also because of the mourning which was customary to observe seven days, because they were also their kinsmen, for when Israel slew the inhabitants of Gibeah in the incident of the concubine in Gibeah (at the end of Judges), the people of Jabesh Gilead gave their daughters to Benjamin, when they grabbed them from the dances.
@13
<b>And Saul died because of the treachery that he had committed</b> He committed two treacherous acts by inquiring of the familiar spirit: one when he inquired after Samuel, and one when he inquired of familiar spirits, and in the Aggadah of Samuel (24:6) we learn that he committed five treacherous acts

<b>You shall shepherd My people</b> Concerning this, David said, (Ps. 23:1): “The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.” “You say to me: You shall shepherd. How can I shepherd? The matter does not depend on me, but the Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want, and I, too, shall not be wanting to you.” A similar instance is found in Samuel (II 21:17): “Then the men of David swore to him, saying, ‘You shall no longer go out with us in battle, so that you extinguish not the lamp of Israel.’” David replied (ibid. 22:29): “For You are my lamp, O Lord; and the Lord does light my darkness.”
@3
<b>and David made with them a covenant</b> Like the covenant that Jehoiada made, as it is written (II Kings 11:17): “And Jehoiada enacted the covenant between the Lord and between the king and between the people, to be the people of the Lord.” The meaning is [that they agreed] to be servants of the Lord, and also “between the king and between the people,” to be his servants according to the king’s judgment, and also that the king should do according to the law for his servants; to wage their wars.
<b>before the Lord</b> But is it not so that the Tabernacle was not in Hebron? What then is the meaning of “before the Lord”? Wherever people make a stipulation or enact a covenant, the Omnipresent is there. A similar instance [is found] in [the case of] Jephthah: (Jud. 11:11): “before the Lord in Mizpah.” [Another] similar instance (Lev. 5:21): “and commits an act of treachery against the Lord by making a denial to his neighbor,” as is explained in <i>Torath Kohanim</i> (ad loc.).

<b>And David... went, etc.</b> He went immediately to war when all Israel crowned him, so that Israel should not say [that in] all the wars that David waged in the days of Saul and was victorious it was Saul’s luck, and that he was now afraid to fight. Therefore he immediately went to war.

<b>And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You shall not come here”</b> He does not explain here why, but in Samuel (II 5:6), Scripture explains: “... and they said to David, saying: You shall not come here unless you remove the blind and the lame.” They saw that they were unable to withstand David. They therefore stationed blind and lame persons before the city gate, “as if to say: David shall not come here,” unless he wages war with these blind people, for they knew that it is disgraceful for a king to wage war against blind men, and because of this, he would turn back and not wage war with them. David said to himself, however, “It is true that it is neither right nor proper for me to wage war with the blind and with the lame, but ‘whoever smites the Jebusites’ in a way that he ‘reaches the tower’ shall pull them and cast them away from there, viz. the blind.” “Therefore they say: The blind and the lame shall not come into the house;” into the house of David, because it will be a disgrace for him, lest they say that David waged war with these [handicapped people].

A similar case is [found] in the beginning of Josiphon about a queen who became ill because she was carried away from the land of her birth, and all the physicians said, “She has no cure until she bathes and derives benefit from the water of her place,” and they did this for her.

Therefore, they took Amasa with them to David, and also some of David’s kinsmen from the rest of Judah, as it is written, “some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah,” in order that David would see that they came with them in good faith, so that he should not suspect them of anything.

And that is the meaning of “like the camp of God.” A similar instance of this is (Gen. 32: 2): “the camp of God” of Jacob.

But the remaining tribes, who had been with Saul’s sons until now - had to come to Hebron to crown him.

<b>and with songs and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels</b> All of these are musical instruments, but cymbals (מְצִלְתַּיִם) were not a musical instrument, and their function was only to make sounds, like the instrument called the kettle drum, <i>Pauken</i> in German, which is struck with sticks to make sounds. This is implied further (15: 25): “and with resounding cymbals,” and it is written (ibid. verse 19): “And the singers: Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, with copper cymbals to resound.” And it is written further below (25:6): “with song in the House of the Lord, with cymbals, etc.,” and because of this, they are called מְצִלְתַּיִם. Similarly (Deut. 28:42): “... the locusts (הַצְּלָצַל) will inherit.” This is a species of locust that makes a sound, as it is written in the prophecy of Joel (2:5) about the locusts: “Like the sound of chariots on the mountaintops, they will leap, etc.”

<b>and He struck him down because he stretched forth his hand upon the Ark</b> This is what is written in II Samuel (6:7): “... and God struck him down there” עַל הַשַּׁל meaning עַל הַשֶּׁלַח, because he stretched forth to hold the Ark. Another example of this is (I Kings 21:23): “The dogs will devour Jezebel” בְּחֵל יִזְרְעֶאל. In another verse it is written: (II Kings 9:10): “בְּחֵלֶק יִזְרְעֶאל,” in the territory of Jezreel. So will we explain עַל הַשַּׁל here as הַשֶּׁלַח

<b>And the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, and all the Philistines went up</b> because the Philistines had been ruling all the time until Saul and David came, as it is written (Jud. 15:11) concerning Samson: “Did you not know that the Philistines rule over us?” And likewise, (I Samuel 4:9): “Strengthen yourselves and become men, you Philistines, lest you serve the Hebrews, as they served you, etc.” Likewise, above in this portion (10:7): “And all the men of Israel saw, etc. and they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and settled in them.” And in those seven years that David reigned in Hebron alone they did not say a word, and they were not concerned that David reigned over Hebron, because they said, “What do we care? Perhaps a governor or an officer appointed David over Hebron.” But when he was anointed king over all Israel, the Philistines all went up to seek David, for they did not want there to be a king in Israel, but that they should continue ruling over them.

The singers and the gate sentries that David stationed after they placed the Ark into the tent that David had pitched for it and in the Tabernacle of Shiloh, were gate sentries, but they were not gate sentries while on the road, because not that many gate sentries were required. Therefore, they became singers, with the exception of two, Berechiah and Elkanah (verse 23). All this was on the road, but when the Ark rested, the singers became gate sentries.

A similar instance is found (below 25:7): “And their number with their brethren, trained in song to the Lord, every expert (מֵבִין) etc.,” and it is written (ibid. verse 8): “and they cast lots, etc.,...expert (מֵבִין) with student.”

<b>sounding the trumpets</b> - Heb. מַחְצְצרִים. It is written with a double “zaddi”; the first is pronounced, and the second is not pronounced. Likewise יִשָּׂשׂכָר, the first “sin” is pronounced, and the second is not pronounced; and so, (Gen. 4:18): “וּמְחִיּיָאֵל יָלַד אֶת מְתוּשָׁאֵל” and so “יִרְאִיָּיה בֶּן שֶׁלֶמְיָה,” (Jer. 37:13), the first [letter] is pronounced, and the second one is not pronounced.

<b>And it came to pass when God helped the Levites</b> - Heb. בֶּעְֹזר. The “beth” of בֶּעְֹזר is vowelized with a “segol,” but as a rule, it is vowelized with a “pattah.” The meaning of “when [God] helped,” is that they did not err when they carried the Ark as they had erred in the beginning when Uzza died. And in the Book of Samuel (II 6:13), it says that when they had trodden six paces, they made this sacrifice. Our Rabbis derived from here that the Ark carried itself.

<b>And David was enwrapped in a linen robe</b> - Heb. מְכֻרְבָּל enwrapped, as in Daniel (3:21): “their robes (וְכַרְבְּלָתְהוֹן).” A similar case is the comb (כַּרְבַּלְתָּא) of a rooster.
<b>and all the Levites</b> were likewise enwrapped in linen robes, and since David was a singer like the Levites, he too wore their raiments, which they wore, and proof of this - to distinguish between the unclean and the clean: It was the custom of the heathen kings and princes, that when they would dine with their priests according to their custom, they would don the garb of their priests.
<b>and on David was a linen ephod</b> like the ephod of Aaron, which was like two felt cloths, one in the front and one in the back, and it reached to his loins, and the girdle was woven from it, and he would gird himself with it.
<b>and Chenaniah the leader of the... song</b> - Heb. הַשַּׂר הַמַּשָּׂא. The noun in the construct state is missing.[It should be] הַשַּׂר שַׂר הַמַּשָּׂא, the leader, the leader of the song, and similarly, (Jos. 3:14): “the Ark of the Covenant (הָאָרוֹן הַבְּרִית),” and others.

<b>and to make mention and to give thanks and to praise</b> “To make mention” means to recite those two psalms in which it is written (Ps. 38, 70): “A song of David to mention”; “and to thank” [means to recite] (ibid. 105): “Give thanks to the Lord, call out in His name”; “and to praise,” [by reciting] those psalms starting with “Hallelujah.”

<b>to give thanks to the Lord by the hand of Asaph and his brethren</b> Asaph would commence, “Give thanks to the Lord, call out in His name,” and afterwards all his brethren would respond after him. A similar instance is found in Ezra (Neh. 11:17): “And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer,” on the instrument of the huyedoth, as it is written in Ezra (ibid. 12:8): “And the Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, Mattaniah over the huyedoth.”

<b>Give thanks to the Lord, call out in His name</b> They sang this psalm on that day before the Ark. And it [the psalm] is also written in the Book of Psalms (105:1-15), but there is a slight difference in some words. The contents, however, are the same. There it goes on until “and do not harm My prophets.” That is indeed the conclusion of the psalm, commencing: “Give thanks to the Lord,” for “Sing to the Lord, all the earth,” is a different psalm. That psalm is also found in the Book of Psalms (96), but there is a slight difference. The contents, however, are the same.
<b>Give thanks to the Lord</b> [These are] David’s words to the singers and to the congregation.
<b>call out in His name</b> Call out, “O Lord, O Lord! May He help His Ark.” A similar instance (I Kings 18:24): “And you will call in the name of your deity, and I shall call in the name of the Lord.” The expression of calling out is appropriate in connection with the Lord because He performs wonders.

<b>Search for the Lord and His might</b> The Sanctuary and Ark are called “His might,” as it is written (Ps. 78:61): “And He delivered His might into captivity,” i.e., He delivered His Ark to bring it into captivity, and it is written (ibid. 132:8): “Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your might.” For that reason, Eleazar, its watchman, was called Uzza, because he guarded the Ark, which was called might (עֹז). An example of this is that [Ephron was called by this name] because of the four hundred silver shekels, which is the numerical value of the name Ephron. And so, many others [as in] (Gen. 49:16): “Dan (דָן) will champion (יָדִין) the right of his people”; (ibid. verse 8): “Judah, (יְהוּדָה) you are the one; to you your brothers do homage (יוֹדוּךָ).”

<b>The seed of Israel His servant</b> In the Book of Psalms [it is written]: “the seed of Abraham His servant,” and it says here, “The seed of Israel His servant,” because the meaning of “the seed of Abraham,” which is written there, refers to the seed of Israel, because Abraham had other seed, but the seed of Israel is exclusively for us; and when it says, “the seed of Abraham,” it means the seed of Israel.

<b>Remember His covenant forever</b> And in Psalms: “He remembered His covenant forever.” The meaning is: The covenant that He made with Abraham - He remembered it forever and for His children, and that which He spoke to him and the promise that He promised him, He commanded that it stand to the thousandth generation. Or the meaning of צִוָּה is גָזַר decreed, like (Lam. 3:37): “... unless the Lord ordained it (צִוָּה).” The meaning is that the word that He decreed [in the Covenant] Between the Parts to give the land of Canaan to their children will be to the thousandth generation, and that which He says here: “Remember,” means: His covenant that is with you forever - remember it constantly.
@16
<b>which He had made with Abraham</b> as it is written (Gen. 15:18): “On that day, God made a covenant with Abram, saying: To your seed have I given, etc.” And that covenant and that oath were for Isaac, i.e., for Isaac and not for Ishmael or the sons of Keturah, for that which He said, “To your seed,” in the covenant and in the oath, was for Isaac, as it is written (ibid. 21:12): “... for through Isaac will seed be called for you.” And the oath took place at the binding of Isaac, as it is written (ibid. 22: 16): “By Myself I have sworn,” and He said to Isaac, (ibid. 26:3): “... and I will keep the oath that I swore to your father, Abraham.” And that covenant and oath - He established for the Children of Israel as a statute, a perpetual covenant, because the covenant and oath were for the designated seed, not for Esau, and so Isaac said to Jacob, (ibid. 28:4): “May God give you the blessing of Abraham.”

And this is a great thing, so that they cannot say that because of your great numbers, you seized the land of Canaan, but when you were few in number. Now if you say that even a thousand or more have a number, what is this about which it is written: “When you were few in number”? Therefore, it says: “hardly dwelling in it.” The meaning is that if He would say to one settler, e.g., to Abraham alone, to Isaac alone, to Jacob alone, to one of them He would say, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,” it would not be a wonder, because they were settled in it! But He swore to give you the land at a time when your ancestors were strangers sojourning in it, as it is written (Gen. 35:27): “... that is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.” And furthermore, if He would say to a stranger who is settling, “To you and to your seed I will give this land,” it would not be such a wonder. Therefore, he says that they were not even strangers who were settling, but...

<b>Do not touch My anointed ones, and do not harm My prophets</b> Concerning Abraham it says (Gen. 12:17): “And the Lord plagued Pharaoh,” and it is written (ibid. 20:3): “And the Lord came to Abimelech in a dream at night and said to him: You shall die, etc.” Concerning Jacob it says: (ibid. 31: 24): “And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night, and said to him: Beware, etc.” And further, concerning Jacob, when they came to kill him because they killed Shechem and Hamor, it is writ ten: (ibid. 35:5): “Then they journeyed on, and the terror of God was, etc.” The Book of Psalms is more explicit, for the psalm does not terminate here, as it is written there (105:16): “He called a famine upon the land,” in order to exile them to Egypt.

<b>Quake before Him, all the earth; also the inhabited world will be established so that it will not falter</b> When a flesh and blood king sees that [the people] are worried and frightened of him, he casts more fear upon them, and they become more worried about him, lest he destroy all their homes, but the attribute of the Holy One, blessed be He, is that He does not do so. When the [inhabitants of] the world fear Him, then the world is established so that it does not falter. He wreaks vengeance upon robbers, and honest people remain in existence, and the earth remains in existence and does not falter. Therefore, “quake before Him, all the earth,” but do not worry because the Holy One, blessed be He, will come only to rectify the world. But when the creatures do not fear Him and they sin, then He will turn them over and destroy them.

<b>Give thanks to the Lord for He is good, for His loving-kindness exists forever</b> This verse (34) is not a conclusion of the Psalm (96) but [a continuation] of Psalm (105): “Give thanks to the Lord, call out in His Name.” The verse (35): “And say, save us, etc.” is from the Psalm (106). And this Psalm (106) commences with this verse (in Chron.). Now is it appropriate here, “And say, etc. and save us from the nations,” for when were they exiled in David’s time, that he should say, “and save us from among the nations”? And this is the arrangement in Psalms. Psalm (105) commences: “Give thanks to the Lord, call out in His name,” and it concludes only with “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, etc.” until “Amen! Hallelujah,” for it is all one topic, but because it is a long psalm, it was divided, and it commences, “Give thanks to the Lord for He is good.” Similarly, Job, when he had to lengthen his reply, he shortened it and divided it in two, and it says, (Job 29:1): “And Job again took up his parable,” for in song, because of his ecstasies of joy, he could not speak at length; so he divided it in two. And so, in the matter of lamentation, because of his intense pain he could not speak at length, and he divided it in two, because both song and lamentation are uttered similarly. When Hannah came to pray in the forecourt, Eli thought her to be a drunken woman, because he thought that she acted in that manner because of wine, but she said, (I Sam. 1:15f.): “... and neither new wine nor old wine have I drunk, etc., for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation....” From here we learn that drunken people and those suffering from pain behave in the same manner.
@35
<b>And say, “Save us</b> At the end of the Psalm (106:42), which speaks about captivity: “And their foes oppressed them, and they were humbled under their hand,” it is written thereafter, (ibid. verse 46): “And He caused them to be pitied by their captors.” Now, it is appropriate to say, “Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from the nations,” as You have done to them. In Psalms, it does not say, “And say, save us” but only, “Save us,” because that is the appropriate wording. For the following reason, David recited these two psalms when he brought the Ark: It is explained in Genesis Rabbah (54:4): “since the cows, when they sang, recited these two psalms.” Rabbi Samuel the son of Nahmani said: (I Sam. 6:12): ‘And the cows sang.’ What song did they sing? ‘Give thanks to the Lord, call out in His name.’ Rabbi Eleazar says: ‘Sing to the Lord, all the earth, etc.’” Therefore, David instituted them to recite them before the Ark, one psalm in the morning and one psalm in the evening. Quoted from Rabbi Eleazar the son of Meshullam of blessed memory.

@13
<b>I shall be to him as a father, and he will be to Me as a son</b> And in Samuel (II 7:14), it is written: “... so that when he goes astray, I will chasten him with the rod of men.” The meaning is that if he sins against Me, I will chasten him immediately, as a man who chastens his son with a rod of men, insofar that He raised up against him as adversaries Rezon and Hadad, and on that verse, it is appropriate to say, “... and I shall not remove My loving kindness from him as I removed it from [Saul] who was before you,” and when he sinned before Me, I removed the kingdom from him and from his seed. In Samuel (ibid. 15) it is written: “from Saul.” The reason it is not written here: “so that when he goes astray, etc.” is because of David’s honor, for he does not wish to speak of this in this Book, because it is denigrating to the house of David.

<b>And it came to pass afterwards that David smote</b> After David stated [his intention] to build a house, and the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You shall not build,” David said, “Since it is not incumbent upon me to build the house, only upon my son, I shall now prepare and arrange everything for him for [the time] when my son comes to build the House so that he has everything prepared.” And now he [the Chronicler] leaves everything and relates how he [David] prepared the building, how he fought with his enemies and designated their spoils for the construction of the House. And so is the manner of the verse, and an example is found regarding Elijah and Elisha, i.e., after he [Elisha] said, (II Ki. 2:9): “Please let there be a double portion of your spirit to me,” he [the author] leaves the entire story of the kings and proceeds to relate some of the wonders of Elisha, how they were a double portion, until he completed them all.

<b>And David smote Hadadezer, king of Zobah, in Hamath</b> The war took place in Hamath, and in Hamath David smote them.
<b>in Hamath</b> - Heb. חֲמָתָה, like לְחַמָת, to Hamath.
<b>to establish his power</b> Its meaning is: when he went to establish his power, to restore his boundary and to establish it by the Euphrates River, for he was restoring to the boundary (sic) of the Euphrates River. An example is (Sam. II 18:18): “And Absalom took and established for himself in his lifetime, etc., and he called it Yad Absalom,” meaning the power of the boundary of Absalom. Another explanation of, “and he called it Yad Absalom”: Absalom engraved the form of the length of his hand in the middle of the monument, as it is written in that verse, that he said that this engraving was engraved after the shape of Absalom’s hand. (I heard this from Isaac the son of Rabbi Samuel in Narbonne.)

I Kings 12:14): “I shall flog you with whips בַּשּׁוֹטִים (Sic),” is translated שַׁרְבִיטִים. (Rabbi Isaac said this also.)
@6

<b>the golden quivers</b> - Heb. שִׁלְטֵי, <i>cuyvres</i>, <i>cuevres</i> in Old French, quivers, and a like word is found in Jeremiah (51:11): “Polish the arrows, fill the quivers הַשְּׁלָטִים”.
@8
<b>huge quantities of copper, from which... made, etc.</b> This is what I stated (verse 17:1); since David stated [his intention] to build the House, and the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, (17:4): “You shall not build... the House,” but your son, he proceeds to tell how he prepared for him to erect the edifice.
@10
<b>for... had been Tou’s opponent in war</b> He was his antagonist, and this is proven above (v. 3): “And David smote Hadarezer” (note Rashi’s reading). Now what connection do they have to Hamath to wage war there? But [the matter is that] Hadarezer, the king of Zobah, went to wage war against Tou the king of Hamath in Hamath, during which David came upon him and smote him.
<b>and all vessels of gold, of silver, and of copper</b> he brought to David; and so it appears in II Samuel (8: 10): “... and in his possession were vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of copper.”

@15
<b>Now Joab, etc. was over the host</b> Since he retired from going with the army, he placed Joab over the host to wage all his battles. All this refers back to “... and he administered justice and charity.” The interruption with “Now Joab, etc. was over the host,” was necessary for the following reason, lest you say that since “... and David was administering justice,” [the result was that] the Israelites were no longer waging war, therefore, it says “Now Joab was over the host.”
<b>recorder</b> - Heb. הַמַּזְכִּיר, lit., the reminder. This refers back to the beginning (verse 14), that he would remind [him of] which case came before the king first, and a similar instance is (Esther 6:1): “... to bring... the records (הַזִּכְרוֹנוֹת), the chronicles.”
@16

Another instance of this (II Sam. 15:18): “... and all his servants passed beside him, and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the Gittites.”

Nahash, the king of the children of Ammon, accepted him, for they [David’s brothers] were no longer mentioned, except Elihu, as it is written in the grouping of the princes (below 27:18): “Of Judah: Elihu of the brothers of David.” That is the meaning of “for his father showed me kindness.” And it was on the basis of that hatred that David smote Moab and abused them more than his other enemies, as it is written (II Sam. 8:2): “And David smote Moab, etc.”

<b>from Aram Naharaim and from Aram-Maacah</b> There were many Arameans, and that is the meaning of Aram-Maacah - the Arameans dwelling in Maacah. Some Arameans dwelt by the Euphrates River, and [likewise] Aram-Zobah; but Aram, without a surname, is the main part of the nation. Similarly, the Ammonites dwelling in Ammon are called Ammonites, but the main part of the nation was in other places, and so, the children of Esau in the land of Seir, but the main part [of the nation] dwelt in Edom.

<b>into the hands of Abshai</b> To Abishai, who is called Abshai throughout the entire Book of Chronicles, both in the written text and in the reading, except for these two cases, which are exceptions to the rule according to the Masorah. The reason that he is called Abshai in this entire Book is because it was written in David’s honor, and it is not honor to call his nephew Abishai, meaning: “I, too, am as esteemed as David because my [grand]father was Jesse [Yishai]” Therefore, in this entire Book, he is called Abshai, and in the entire Book of Samuel he is called Abishai, except once, where he is called Abshai: (II Sam. 10:10): “And the rest of the people he gave over to Abshai his brother.” This is according to the Masorah, because Jesse was the father of his mother, Zeruiah, who was his mother.

I heard in Narbonne that it is the prevalent custom in the land of Ishmael to suspend the king’s crown over his head, and he sits opposite it below on a throne, and that which is written: “... and it was on David’s head,” means that it appeared as though it were on his head.

<b>Now it came to pass after this that a war arose in Gezer</b> That which is missing here is written in Samuel (II 21:15): “And the Philistines waged war again with Israel, and David went down with his servants and they fought against the Philistines.” And this too was not written here because of David’s honor, for it is written there: “... and David became faint,” and it is written: (ibid. 16): “And Ishbi, who was one of the sons of Raphah, was in Nob, etc., and he was girded with new armor, and he thought to smite David,” and had it not been for the aid of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, he would have fallen into the hands of Ishbi in Nob and because of that disgrace, [the Chronicler] did not mention these things here.
<b>then Sibbecai the Hushathite smote Sippai of the sons of Rapha</b> But in Samuel (II 21:18), it is written: “Saph, who was one of the sons of Rashah,” who was the brother of Goliath the Philistine and Ishbi in Nob.

<b>And Elhanan the son of Jair smote</b> He was one of David’s mighty men.
<b>Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, and the staff of his spear was as [thick as] a weavers’ beam</b> like the round stick about which they wrap the cloth while weaving. Jonathan translated that verse in Samuel: And David the son of Jesse, the weaver of the dividing curtain of the Temple, slew. He interprets Jair (יָעִיר) as being similar to the Lebanon forest (יַעַר). He was paid in kind: Let David, whose mother wove the dividing curtain for the Temple with a weavers’ beam, slay Goliath, whose spear staff was as thick as a weavers’ beam. Now why does Scripture call him Elhanan? Because God favored him (ה' חֲנָנוֹ). I believe that Goliath the Gittite is not identical with Goliath the Philistine. One reason is that there [I Sam. 17:23] he called him Goliath the Philistine. Another reason is that above it is written: “... then Sibbecai the Hushathite smote Sippai of the sons of Rapha,” and also below it is written: “and he too was born to Raphah.” Since he does not mention that Goliath the Gittite was a son of Rapha, it proves that he [Goliath the Gittite] was not her son
@6
<b>and there was a man of great stature</b>. This is similar to (Num. 13:32): “big in stature,” and since he was so tall that he had to be measured, he calls him a man of measure.
<b>and his fingers were six and six</b> Twelve on his hands and twelve on his feet, and in Samuel (II 21:20) it says: “twenty-four in number,” i.e., one beside the other, so that one can count them, and this also was his strength, for he was able to grasp the sword with the great strength of his hand. And in Tractate <i>Bechoroth</i> (45b) it is explained why it is written: “six and six, totaling twenty-four.” It is necessary, because if it were written, “six and six,” we would say six on one hand and six on one foot. Therefore, it says, “twenty- four.” And if it would say, “twenty-four,” I would say seven on one and five on the other. Therefore, it says, “six and six, totaling twenty-four.”

<b>and all Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand, etc. and Judah was four hundred seventy thousand</b> But in Samuel (II 24:9) it is written: “eight hundred thousand, etc., and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men,” which apparently means that there were not so many of Israel as are stated here. The truth is that because the anger of the Holy One, blessed be He, was upon David, Scripture did not write there the number of all of those whom he had counted. Neither did Joab count all the tribes, as it is written (verse 6): “... because the word of the king was repugnant to Joab.” But here, because of David’s honor, he does mention the number and the reckoning that he counted, because it is his honor that such a massive army was in his tribe. And the following is proof to what I explained: that even that small part of Israel that he counted, he did not write their entire number in Samuel, but here, [the Chronicler] did write the entire number that he counted, because it is written here: “and all Israel were,” whereas in Samuel it is not written: “all.” And it is explicitly proven here before us, as it is written: (below 27:24): “Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count but did not finish, and with this there was anger upon Israel, and the number did not reach the number of the chronicles of King David.”
@6
<b>But Levi and Benjamin he did not count among them, etc.</b> Joab knew that it would be considered a sin for the people, leading to a plague; Joab therefore said, “I can save these tribes from the census. Concerning Levi, if David says: ‘Why did you not count Levi?’ I shall answer him that they were not counted among the Children of Israel (Num. 2:33). And this is what I shall say about Benjamin: ‘Weren’t they stricken in the episode of the concubine in Gibeah? If they are afflicted now, what will be left of them?’”

<b>and now, please put aside the iniquity of Your servant</b> - Heb. עֲווֹן. This עֲווֹן is written with the plene spelling, with two “vavim,” i.e., please put aside the full iniquity that I committed. This word is written with the plene spelling in four places in Scripture, and this is one of them. The second is in Psalms (51:7): “Behold with iniquity (בְּעָווֹן) I was formed,” as it is explained in <i>Leviticus Rabbah</i> (14:5), in the section entitled: (Lev. 12:2): “If a woman conceives seed: Even if one be the most pious of the pious, it is impossible that he should have no streak of unintentional iniquity, because he intended only for his own pleasure.” The third is (Prov. 5:22): “His iniquities (עֲווֹנוֹתָיו) shall trap the wicked man,” meaning his many iniquities. The fourth is in II Kings (7:9): “... we will incur guilt (עָווֹן). Now let us go and come and relate this in the king’s palace.” They said, “If we do not go and tell this in the king’s palace, it will be a grave iniquity, because enemies will come upon them.”

We find (in the first year that the Israelites were in the desert) that Scripture testifies about him: “and Joshua the son of Nun, his young [servant],” and at that time he was forty-two years old. Therefore, it was necessary to write, “tender,” because he [Solomon] was only twelve years old when he reigned.

This is proven immediately following (verse 6): “... one father’s house established for Eleazar, and what was established for Ithamar remained established,” i.e., as it was established [that they] be stationed as a watch in the Tabernacle, so did David station them now in the Temple.”

<b>And Shemaiah... wrote them</b> to be a reminder for them who was first, who second, and so all of them.
@19
<b>These are their appointment[s] to their service</b> Those who are written here are the heads of the watches. Their appointments were over the watches.

@1
<b>Then David separated for the service</b> to sing the songs.
<b>the sons of Asaph, etc.</b> Out of all the Levites he separated only the sons of Asaph, etc.
<b>Heman, and Jeduthun, who prophesied</b> When they would play these musical instruments, they would prophesy. A similar incident [is told] of Elisha: (II Kings 3:15): “’And now fetch me a musician.’ And when the musician played, the hand of the Lord came upon him.”
<b>and the number of those men expert in their work... was:</b> i.e., There were twenty- four watches, corresponding to the twenty-four watches [of the priests (Moharich)]: viz. the four sons of Asaph, the six of Jeduthun, and the fourteen of Heman, totaling twenty-four. Below, he sums them all up, as it is written (verse 7): “And their number with their brethren, etc.”
@3
<b>and Mattithiah - six</b> But you will find only five. [The answer is that] his wife was pregnant with Shimei, and he saw through the holy spirit that he too was destined to be the chief of a watch; therefore he says “six.” And that is what is stated further: (verse 17): “The tenth: Shimei.” This is what the liturgical poet set down (in the Kedushah of Yozer of Parashath Shekalim): “Inscribed from the womb to be counted in the watch of the Sanctuary.”
<b>beside their father Jeduthun</b> עַל יְדֵי, similar to (Neh. 3:8): “And beside him (עַל יָדוֹ)... repaired.”
<b>who prophesied with [songs of] thanksgiving and praise</b> For on the harp they would play songs of “Give thanks (הוֹדוּ)” and songs of “Hallelujah (הַלְלוּיָהּ),” and he would prophesy.
@4
<b>and Romamti Ezer</b> This is one name.
@5
<b>the king’s seer, in words of God to raise the horn</b> the horn of the prophecy, for he would prophesy for the king. A similar instance of this is (I Sam. 2:10): “... and raise the horn of His anointed one.”
<b>and God gave Heman</b> Had not God given him children, it would have been impossible for him to have fourteen sons and three daughters, with all of them fit to be chiefs of watches. A similar case is (Ruth 4:13): “... and the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.” Had not this been a gift from the Lord, it would have been impossible for Boaz to father a son, because he was old. Similarly, (Deut. 34:1): “and the Lord showed him all the land.” Had this vision not been from the Lord, it would have been impossible to see so far.
@7
<b>every expert</b> - Heb. הַמֵּבִין. In regard to song, the expression is appropriate, for it is written: (below verse 8): “expert (מֵבִין) with pupil.” [Also] (15:22): “And Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites in song; he would chastise in song because he was an expert (מֵבִין).”
@8
<b>And they cast lots, a watch against</b> The meaning is a watch against a watch, and a similar [case] is [found] above (16:5): “... but I have walked from tent to tent and from tabernacle,” which means: “and from tabernacle to tabernacle.”
<b>like the small one so the great one, scholar with pupil</b> The meaning is that they cast lots for the watches, this one against that one, a watch against a watch, the small one was like the great one, the expert master with the pupil, all of them were equal in this, for the one on whom the first lot fell, if to the small one, he would come first to be the first one, and if last, he would be the last one, and so all of them, whether a scholar or a pupil, whether a small person or a great one. And these watches of the Levites followed the watches of the priests: the one to whom the first lot fell had the first lot, and his watch was with the watch of Jehoiarib the priest, and the one to whom the second lot fell waited, and his watch was with the watch of Jedaiah the priest.
@9
<b>And the first lot of Asaph came out to Joseph</b> his first son.
<b>Gedaliah the second</b> Gedaliah was the firstborn of Jeduthun.
<b>he and his brethren and his sons, twelve</b> The meaning is that for every watch twelve Levites would come, for all of them equalled two hundred and eighty-eight, and if you divide them into twenty-four parts, each part will consist of twelve Levites. So it appears to me. And this is the meaning of “and his brethren and his sons”: referring to Joseph and to Gedaliah. And since they are both mentioned in one verse, he wrote only once, “he and his sons and his brethren.” And not every “his brethren,” and “their brethren” in this context mean his actual brothers; but he calls one group brethren (in German, <i>Bruderschaft</i>).
@10
<b>The third: Zaccur</b> the firstborn of Asaph.
@11
<b>The fourth to Izri</b> the second son of Jeduthun.
@12
<b>The fifth: Nethaniah</b> the third son of Asaph. So the lot fell from this one to that one.

@1
<b>Of the divisions of the gate sentries: of the Korahites</b> They do not rotate, but they distributed them according to the gates, and they later cast lots [to determine] who would serve at this gate and who at another gate. In this way it is explained further (verses 13-19).
<b>of the Korahites: Meshelemiah the son of Kore of the sons of Asaph</b> And [we find] a similarity above (9:19): “And Shallum the son of Kore, etc.”
@5
<b>for God had blessed him</b> as is stated above (13:14): “... and the Lord blessed the house of Obed- Edom, etc.”
@6
<b>who ruled through their father’s house</b> The meaning is that those ruling were doing so through their father, and a similarity is [found] at the end of Daniel (11:3): “and rule a great dominion (וּמָשַל מִמְשַל רַב).”
@8
<b>valiant men</b> - Heb. אִיש חַיִל, not with strength and not in war but like a man about whom someone says, “So-and-so is of high esteem,” and similarly, (Ruth 2:1): “... a mighty man of valor, etc., and his name was Boaz.”
@12
<b>watches corresponding to their brethren</b> the chiefs of twenty-four watches.
@13
<b>And they cast lots, the small like the great, to their fathers’ houses for each gate</b> who will receive this gate, and who will receive this gate, to the east, to the west, to the north, to the south, and so to all the gates in the forecourt.
@17
<b>and to the Asuppim</b> a place named Asuppim.
@18
<b>Toward the outside</b> Heb. לַפַּרְבָּר. This is explained in Tractate <i>Tamid</i> (ad loc.): “Said Rava: לַפַּרְבָּר means כְּלַפֵּי בָּר, toward the outside.”
@20
<b>And the Levites: Ahiah over the treasuries, etc.</b> He was appointed over the money with which sacrifices were purchased for the House of God, such as the holy sacrifices (sic).
@21
<b>The sons of Ladan</b> To Ladan the Gershonite was the chief of the fathers, Jehiel. He is Ladan mentioned above (23:7-9).
@22
<b>and Joel his brother</b> The brother of Jehiel, as is written above (23:8): “Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel.”
<b>over the treasuries of the House of the Lord</b> There were many treasuries in the forecourt, each treasury for its individual purpose, and over each one was one appointee.
@24
<b>And Shebuel the son of Gershom was the ruler over the treasuries</b> Similarly, [this means] the ruler over one of the treasuries of the forecourt. Others explain [that he was literally] the ruler over the treasuries. All the Temple trustees were under him.
@29
<b>Of the Izharites: Chenaniah and his sons to the outside work</b> to the work that was done outside the city, in the forests and in the mountains; to hew cedars and to quarry stones and to plow fields belonging to the Sanctuary.
@30
<b>Of the Hebronites: Hashabiah... to all the work of the Lord</b> They are the officers over those who did the work of the Lord in trans-Jordan.
<b>and to the service of the king</b> They were also appointed over the dwellers of the king’s heritage and the king’s treasuries, and so [we find] further (v. 32): “for every matter of God and matter of the king.”
@31
<b>to his generations to the fathers in the fortieth year, etc.</b> And also all these computations were in the fortieth year.
#27
@1
<b>in every matter of the divisions</b> All this was from the beginning of his reign and onwards, and since the number of the Levites is stated, he proceeds to relate who the leaders of David’s division were.
<b>the one coming and the one leaving, month by month, for all the months of the year</b> for all the Israelites were divided into twelve parts, and each segment served the king for a month, and the king would provide them with their expenses, as it is written in the Book of Kings (I 4:7): “And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household.” They were ready to fight his war and to [perform] all his service in that month. All this was [instituted] at the beginning of his reign.
<b>twenty-four thousand</b> Although Israel was more than twelve times twenty-four thousand, David chose only the mighty warriors and the rich people, who could leave their affairs and engage in the king’s affairs; David did not take the poor people, who had to support themselves.
@3
<b>the chief of all the leaders of the hosts</b> Jashabeam was [one] of the sons of Perez, and he was the chief of all the twelve leaders, and because he was [one] of the sons of Perez, David appointed him chief.
@4
<b>Umikloth was the leader</b> His fellow division member, who assisted him, was Umikloth.
@5
<b>The leader of the third host</b> Heb. שַׂר הַצָּבָא הַשְּׁלִישִי. Because of the honor of Benaiah, he calls him the leader of the host more than the others, with the exception of Jashabeam, who was of the sons of Perez, who is likewise called (verse 3): “the chief of all the leaders of the hosts,” because of David’s honor, who was, like him, [one] of the sons of Perez.
<b>the priest, the chief</b> who was the chief, and some say that he was the high priest, but it is not so, because Zadok and Ebiathar were high priests.
@6
<b>the mightiest of the thirty</b> as above (11:25): “Of the thirty, he was the most honored, etc.”
@7
<b>The fourth, etc., was Asahel, the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him</b> for Asahel was assassinated at the beginning of his reign, for Abner assassinated him, (II Sam. 2:23) and he [David] appointed Zebadiah his son in his stead over his division.
@8
<b>the leader was Shamhuth the Zerahite</b> - Heb. הַיִּזְרָח
@16
<b>And over the tribes of Israel</b> We already stated the chiefs of David’s divisions, and now he tells who the leaders of the tribes of Israel were, the leader of each tribe.
@23
<b>Now David did not take their count from twenty years old and below</b> The meaning is: We already stated that he counted Israel and divided them into divisions, and he also counted the Levites and appointed them upon their service; and all these that he counted he did not count any of them less than twenty years old.
<b>like the stars of the heavens</b> Just as man cannot count the stars of the heavens, so he cannot count them.
@24
<b>but did not finish</b> The meaning is: And moreover, I say to you: Did not Joab commence on another occasion to count the people above twenty and not finish?
<b>and there was wrath upon Israel because of this</b> Because of the small segment that he counted, there was wrath upon Israel, because it entered his mind to count all Israel and to transgress the verse (Gen. 13:16): “...so that if anyone can count the dust of the earth, etc.” and to transgress the verse (ibid. 15:5): “Look, please, toward heaven, etc.”
<b>and the number did not come up to</b> The meaning is: Although I say, “commenced to count but did not finish,” he counted only a small segment, for the number of the counted ones in the Book of Samuel did not come up to the number in Chronicles, (21:5) for that number that he counted he did not write in Samuel, but a little of the number, and here, because of David’s honor, even if the number were more, he would have stated it, because it implies that not for nought was there wrath on Israel because he already counted many of Israel, and moreover, because of his honor, that they were all his servants, like one man.
@25
<b>And over the treasuries of the king</b> the treasuries of silver and gold. All this he proceeds to relate for David’s greatness, and even the one who was appointed over his she-donkeys.
<b>and over the storehouses in the field</b> and over what grew in the field: grains, wine, and oil, and all kinds of foods and drinks.
<b>in the cities</b> to supply the cities and to supply the cities of the king and his towers.
@26
<b>And over those who do the work of the field for the work of the soil</b> to plow the soil.
<b>Ezri the son of Chelub</b> was appointed to command to plow the soil, and he would give them the cattle and all the implements of the plow.
@27
<b>And over the vineyards</b> to hoe and prune the vineyards.
<b>and over what was in the vineyards</b> i.e., the storehouses of the wine.
@28
<b>And over the olive trees</b> to plant them and gather the olives.
@29
<b>And over the cattle that pasture in the Sharon was Shirtai the Sharonite</b> who was knowledgeable in matters concerning them.
@30
<b>the Ishmaelite</b> who knew the character of the occupation of camels.
@31
<b>And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagarite</b> Since the Hagarites were tent dwellers in the field, he appointed him over his flocks.
@32
<b>And Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons</b> He was their nurturer and their nurse, who taught them culture.
@33
<b>And Hushai the Archite</b> - Heb. קִרְיַתסֵפֶר (Jos. 15:15, Jud. 1:11) is translated by the Targum as קִרְיְתָא דְּאַרְכֵי. In <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> we find that when David sinned with Bathsheba, he asked Hushai the Archite whether, if he would repent, the Holy One, blessed be He, would accept his repentance to grant him an extension for his sin, and he said, “Yes.”
<b>the king’s companion</b> His best man (Jud. 14: 20): “to his companion (לְמֵרֵעֵהוּ), who had accompanied (רֵעָה) him,” written regarding Samson; it is translated by the <i>Targum</i>: שׁוֹשְׁבִינֵיהּ his best man.
@34
<b>And after Ahithophel</b> After he died, David took for himself Jehoiada and Ebiathar in his place.
#28
@1
<b>And David assembled all the leaders of Israel</b> These are the leaders, the leaders of the tribes, as it is written (above 27:16): “And over the tribes of Israel, the leader of the Reubenites was...”
<b>and the leaders of the divisions</b> These are the twelve divisions of the king, as above (27:1): “And the Children of Israel to their number, etc.”
<b>and the leaders of the thousands</b> as above.
<b>and the leaders of the hundreds</b> their officers.
<b>and the officers over all the property and the livestock of the king</b> those whom he mentions above (27:25-31): “And over the treasuries of the king... and over the vineyards... and over the olive trees... and the livestock”; and the officers who were in charge of the cattle, and of the camels, and of the flocks, for every species of domestic animal is called מִקְנֶה, as it is written (Ecc. 2:7): “I also had much livestock (מִקְנֶה) consisting of cattle and flocks.”
@8
<b>all Israel</b> the stranger like the native.
<b>and in the ears of our God</b> Before our God, similar to (Deut. 29:9): “You are standing today, all of you, before the Lord your God.” Also, (II Kings 23:3): “And the king stood on his place, etc. before the Lord.”
<b>observe and seek all the commandments of the Lord your God</b> He said this to all Israel together, but to Solomon he said it before all Israel [as in the following verse].
@9
<b>and worship Him with a whole heart</b> Heb. בְּלֵב שָׁלֵם. It is not stated בְּלֵבָב שָׁלֵם, which would mean two hearts, but בְּלֵב שָׁלֵם, that you shall have but one heart for our Father Who is in heaven. And so did the liturgical poet set down (in the Kedushah of Musaph of the first day of Rosh Hashanah): “You have two hearts like one for the One.” Similar to this, [we find in] (I Kings 8:61): “Let your heart [therefore] be whole (שָׁלֵם) with the Lord our God.” It is not written שְׁלֵמִים but שָׁלֵם: your two hearts will be one whole heart. And so it is explained (Gen. 18:5): “... and refresh your heart (לִבְּכֶם), afterwards you may pass on.” This teaches us that the angels have only one heart, and also in the future it will be so, as it is written: (Ps. 48:14): “Give heed (לִבְּכֶם lit., your heart) to its walls.”
<b>for the Lord seeks all hearts</b> Here it is appropriate to say לְבָבוֹת ; the Lord seeks all hearts, whether good or bad.
<b>and He understands the thoughts of every creation</b> In <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> (9:3), we learned: “Before a creature is created, the Holy One, blessed be He, understands what the person is destined to think.”
<b>if you seek Him, He will be found to you</b> Therefore, I say, (v. 8): “and seek all the commandments of the Lord.”
<b>He will abandon you forever</b> Heb. יַזְנִיחֲךָ. It is not written here: He will forsake you (יַעַזָבְךָ), but He will abandon you (יַזְנִיחֲך), which is [a] harsher [term] like (Isa. 19: 6): “And they will abandon (הֶאֶזְנִיחוּ) the rivers”; (Lam 2:7): “The Lord abandoned (זָנַַח) His altar.”
@10
<b>for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the Sanctuary</b> not to build it for Him to dwell therein, for the heavens and the heavens of the heavens cannot contain Him, but for the Sanctuary, for the requirement of the Ark, which is called מִקְדָּשׁ, as it is written (Num. 10:21): “And the Kehathites, the bearers of the מִקְדָּשׁ traveled,” and that is the Ark. He did not choose you because you are more praiseworthy than other men, but for His sake and for the sake of His mercies; therefore be strong and do it.
@11
<b>the pattern of the porch</b> Its length, its width, and its height as is written in I Kings (6:3): “And the porch before the Temple of the House, etc.”
<b>and its treasuries</b> the place where the treasuries of the hallowed objects were deposited.
@12
<b>that he had by the spirit</b> As Samuel the Seer showed him, as it is written (above 9:22): “... whom David and Samuel established permanently.” Our Rabbis said (<i>Zeb.</i> 54b) (I Sam. 19:22): “... and he asked and said, ‘Where are Samuel and David?’ And one said, ‘Behold at Naioth in Ramah.’” They were engaged in the building of the world. That refers to the Temple. And he taught him at that time what a faithful student cannot learn in many years. (<i>Mid. Sam.</i> 22:4)
<b>round about, of the treasuries of the House of God and of the treasuries of the hallowed things</b> but he does not explain which of the hallowed things that David and the chiefs of the fathers’ houses hallowed [he is referring to]; and at that time they were appointed over it until they would build the Temple, but these treasuries were always in existence as long as the Temple existed.
@13
<b>And of the divisions of the priests and the Levites</b> for he divided them into twentyfour watches, as above; all this he gave over to him.
<b>and of all the vessels of the service of the House of the Lord</b> the weight of what and how much each vessel is, as is explained.
@14
<b>Of gold, in weight for gold, for all the vessels of every service</b> and so for all silver vessels by weight.
@15
<b>and their lamps of gold</b> the weight of each lamp.
<b>of the weight of each candelabrum</b> for he made ten candelabra.
<b>in the service of every candelabrum</b> and the weight of the service vessels of the candelabrum, its tongs and its charcoal pans, and also the weight.
@16
<b>for the tables of the showbread</b> upon which to arrange the showbread. [He instructed him] about the weight of each table, for he made ten golden tables in the Heichal and the weight of the silver for the tables in the forecourt, upon which they would flay the sacrifices, and the weight of the forks and the basins.
@17
<b>and for the basins of gold in weight</b> Heb. כְּפוֹרֵי כְּפוֹרֵי. [They] are service vessels with which to wipe the blood from the vessels, and an example is in the first (sic) chapter of <i>Baba Mezia</i> (24a): “The man who wiped (דְּכָפַר) his hands with his neighbor’s cloak,” and every [expression of] כַּפָּרָה is an expression of wiping and purification.
@18
<b>refined gold</b> - Heb. זָהָב מְזֻקָּק, like refined silver (כֶּסֶף מְזֻקָּק).
<b>and for the pattern of the chariot</b> They are the cherubim upon which the Shechinah “rides.”
<b>which spread out [their wings] and covered</b> Heb. לְפרְשִׂים. i.e., which were spreading and covering over the Ark, as is stated (Ex. 25: 20): “The cherubim shall spread their wings, etc.”
@19
<b>All was in writing</b> The meaning is: He arranged everything in writing for him: the sum of every weight of every vessel, from Samuel the Seer.
<b>all the works of the pattern</b> He endowed me with the wisdom and the understanding of the pattern of the House, e.g., the pattern of the length, the width, and the height, and Samuel derived everything from the Torah with the holy spirit, as we learned (<i>Middoth</i> 2:1): “The Temple Mount was five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits.” He expounded (Ex. 27:18): “The length of the forecourt was one hundred cubits; the free width: fifty by fifty.” Fifty times fifty are twentyfive hundred cubits. It appears to me that he cut them into five strips to be five hundred by five hundred cubits. This was set down in the final liturgical poem for the Sabbath of Hanukkah, which commences: “Manasseh, etc.” Samuel derived all this with the holy spirit and taught it to David.

@9
<b>for... wholeheartedly</b> With one heart they gave, with the desire of their soul, and not with two hearts, for there is a person who gives against his will and not with an eager soul or because he is ashamed of others, and that is called two hearts, but all these gave with the desire of their soul.
<b>and King David also rejoiced a great rejoicing</b> And lest you say that [he rejoiced] like them but no more, Scripture therefore states: “... and King David also rejoiced, etc.,” more than all of them, because he was the performer of the deed. A similar case (Jud. 5:5): “The mountains melted at the presence of the Lord; this was Sinai”: more than all of them, (Ex. 19:18): “... because the Lord had descended upon it in fire.”
@10
<b>And David blessed the Lord before the eyes of the entire assembly</b> that he had assembled, as is stated (above 28:1): “And David assembled,” and he blessed them for their willing donations.
<b>and David said, “Blessed are You, the God of Israel our Father</b> For this reason he mentions Israel more than Abraham and Isaac because Jacob also vowed, as it is written (Gen. 28:20): “And Jacob made a vow.”
<b>Israel our Father</b> Israel the Patriarch, and also in <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> is (70:2) it is explained in that manner. I, David, and my people, have vowed like Israel the Patriarch, and whoever makes a vow must mention Israel in his vow. And likewise (Ps. 132:2): “vowed to the mighty God of Jacob.”
<b>from everlasting to everlasting</b> David said: Jethro was one proselyte among six hundred thousand, and he said (Ex. 18:10): “Blessed is the Lord who saved you.” This was a great disgrace for all Israel, but I shall bless the Holy One, blessed be He, more than Jethro.
@11
<b>Yours, O Lord, are the greatness</b> He gave praise to the Holy One, blessed be He, that He gave him so much strength to amass such a fortune for the building of the Temple, as it is written (above 17: 12): “He will build Me a House,” and near this [is written]: “O Lord, for the sake of Your servant and according to Your own heart, You have brought about all this greatness.” Now the expression of greatness can also refer to the building of the Temple, as it is written (above 22:5): “... and the House to build for the Lord, to magnify it on high.”
<b>Yours, O Lord, are the greatness</b> Although I have amassed all this fortune for the building of the Temple, which is called greatness, You have given me all this greatness.
<b>the might</b> for You gave me might to wage war with Israel’s enemies and to plunder their spoils before You, to build the House, as above. After he had waged war with all his enemies and defeated them, it is written (above 18:11): “Those also King David dedicated to the Lord, etc.”
<b>the glory</b> All these praises he praised him because the Holy One, blessed be He, had given him strength to amass a fortune for the building of the Temple, which is called glory (פְּאֵר), as it is written (Isa. 60: 13): “to glorify (לְפָאֵר) the place of My sanctuary,” and also above (22:5): “for fame and for glory (וּלְתִפְאֶרֶת).”

<b>Yours is the kingdom and [You are He] Who is exalted over everything as the Leader</b> The meaning is: If a flesh and blood king gives a position or a ruling power in the kingdom to one of his servants after the prince, he is his servant wherever he is, but the kingdom does not belong to the king, and the one to whom the kingdom belongs does not have the servant, but as for the Holy One, blessed be He - the servant appointed to rule is His, and also the kingdom is His (<i>cotre</i> in Old French, kingdom) and therefore, it is written: “Yours is the kingdom, and You are He Who is exalted” over them, for even the superintendent of the well is appointed from heaven (<i>Baba Bathra</i> 91b). They explained further: “... and [You are He] Who is exalted over everything at the beginning.” When we think that we have praised You with all the thanksgivings, and You have no more praise, it is still nothing, for the praised One stands at the beginning of the praises. And so when David concludes all his praises in Psalms, he commences with the final psalm (149:1): “Sing to the Lord a new song,” i.e., all the praises are new, as though we had never praised Him. In this manner Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Meir the son of Rabbi Isaac of Orleans explained, and it seems to me that it is so in Hagigah Yerushalmi.
@12
<b>And wealth and honor are from before you</b> from Your hand. “Honor” applies to wealth, as it is written (Nahum 2:10): “Plunder silver! Plunder gold! etc.” And like (Gen 31:1): “... and from what belonged to our father he amassed all this wealth (הַכָּבוֹד).” That is to say that all the wealth that I have amassed is from You, for “You rule over all, and in Your hand is strength and might, etc.”

<b>and from Your hand we have given it to You</b> - Heb. נָתַנּוּ. And what You have given us from Your hand, we have given You part. The “nun” punctuated by the “dagesh” substituted for the second “nun” נָתַנְנוּ לְךָ.
@15
<b>For we are strangers before You</b> and we have no share or inheritance in the land and not a possession, only to live in it. An example is (Lev. 25:23): “...for you are only strangers and inhabitants with Me.”
<b>like all our forefathers</b> A man who has sons and estates and has sold all the estates, if his sons come to live in that estate days and years later, they are called strangers and inhabitants, but our forefathers were guests. And so did David say: We are not so, but both we and our forefathers are all strangers and inhabitants in the world, as it is written (Ps. 89:12): “The heaven is Yours, even the earth is Yours; the inhabited earth and the fullness thereof, You founded them.”
<b>as a shadow are our da ys on the earth</b> It is explained in <i>Midrash Koheleth</i> (<i>Ecc. Rabbah</i> 1:2): “Not like the shadow of a tree and not like a flying bird, which casts a shadow for days or years or casts a shadow for one hour, but like the shadow of the wings of a bee, which has wings but has no shadow.”

<b>and You desire equity</b> And You desire a good and straight heart, and so I know that with the straightness of my heart, for I have straightened my heart to one heart when I willingly gave all these, and from Your people, who gave willingly. The meaning is: With mine I am familiar and I know it well, but that of others I do not know, but I saw that they donated joyously, I say...
<b>and now, Your people, who are present here, offer willingly to You</b> That is to say, I saw that they rejoiced in their donation, but I do not know whether it was from the willingness of their heart, as it is written: (above verse 9): “... and the people rejoiced over their donation.”
<b>who are present</b> The ones found here are those mentioned above (28:1): “And David assembled all the leaders of Israel, etc.,” but all the wealthy of Israel who were in all the cities were not found here. Therefore, Lord of the universe, the donation was diminished, for had all the remaining Israelites been there, then the donation would have increased.
@18

@19
<b>And to Solomon, my son, give a perfect heart</b> to prepare his heart to be perfect with his God, to keep His commandments, etc., and so did Solomon request (I Kings 8:57-61): “May the Lord our God be with us... Let your heart, [therefore] be perfect.”

<b>And David said to the entire assembly</b> This refers back to (above 28:1): “And David assembled all the leaders of, etc.”
<b>Now bless the Lord your God</b> It does not say, “The God of your fathers,” but “your God,” which implies: but not the God of your fathers. Therefore, it says, “Now bless the Lord your God,” but they said, “Our God and the God of our fathers,” and therefore, [it says:] “... and the assembly blessed the Lord, the God of their fathers,” out of appeasement to God and because of His holiness.
@21
<b>on the morrow of that day</b> the day of this assembly, when David spoke all his words, for on that day they had no time, because when they left the assembly, they were busy until night buying sacrificial animals, and on the morrow, “they slaughtered sacrifices, etc.”
<b>a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, and their libations</b> On the pattern of (Num. 7:17): “five rams, five he-goats, etc.,” one quantity for them all.
<b>and numerous sacrifices</b> It is customary for Scripture to speak in this manner; when it speaks of two or three things, it leaves the first one until the end and explains the last one immediately, and so (Gen. 31:33): “And Laban came into Jacob’s tent... and came into Rachel’s tent.” Now was it not already stated, “And Laban came into Jacob’s tent,” which was Rachel’s tent? However, “and did not find” refers to the maidservants, mentioned last, and then he explains the first matter, “... and he went out of Leah’s tent” first, and he “came into Rachel’s tent.” From Leah’s tent he went to Rachel’s tent, but because he had to say other things about this, “And Rachel had taken, etc.” and consequently, it is inappropriate to say, “... and in the tent of the two maidservants and did not find.” Here too, he had other things to say about the sacrifices, namely...
@22
<b>And they ate and drank, etc. on that day, etc.</b> And if he would say, “and they slaughtered sacrifices to the Lord,” he would interrupt between the sacrifices [i.e., the peace offerings] and the burnt offerings with other matters, and in order not to interrupt, he did not state it immediately, but waited until the end and stated, “... and numerous sacrifices, and they ate and drank before the Lord.” An example of this (Ex. 18:12): “And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took, etc.”
<b>and they crowned Solomon the son of David a second time</b> They had already crowned him once, as is written in I Kings (1:39): “And Zadok the priest took the horn, etc.” It is stated explicitly in <i>Horayot</i> (11b): “The king, the son of a king, is not anointed. Why then did they anoint Solomon? David commanded to anoint him in order to remove [the false idea] from the heart of Adoniah’s supporters to crown him.”
<b>and they anointed [him] to the Lord as ruler</b> - Heb. נָגִיד, from an expression of נְגִידוּ, the <i>Targum</i> for (Ex. 12:21): “pull,” as in (Num. 27:17): “... who will go out before them and who will come in before them and who will lead them out and who will bring them in.”
<b>and Zadok as priest</b> because Ebiathar had anointed Adoniah.
@23
<b>And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king</b> Here it is appropriate to say that he reigned on the throne of the Lord because the throne is God’s to enthrone upon it whomever He wishes, and in the Midrash (<i>Peskikta d’Rav Kahana</i> p. 53a) it is explained that the throne was full (at its highest level) like the moon on the fifteenth of the month, because from Abraham to Solomon were fifteen generations: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmah, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David, and Solomon, and that is what is written: (Ps. 89:37): “...and his throne is like the sun before Me,” which never diminishes, and if you wish to compare it to the moon, it will be like the moon which will be established in the time to come. But from Solomon and onward, the kings diminished from their greatness like the moon, which continuously diminishes, until Zedekiah, (II Kings 25:7): “...and he blinded Zedekiah’ s eyes.”
<b>and all Israel obeyed him</b> immediately, unlike Saul, about whom it is written: (I Sam. 10:27): “And wicked men said: How will this one save us?” And also David ruled at first only in Hebron for seven years.
@24
<b>And all the leaders and the mighty men</b> unlike Adoniah, as it is written (I Kings 1:8): “... and David’s mighty men were not with Adoniah.”
<b>and also all King David’s sons placed their hand</b> unlike Adoniah, under whom they did not place their hand.
<b>placed their hand</b> In faith they gave their handclasp to Solomon to serve him wholeheartedly.
@25
<b>and He bestowed upon him such regal majesty</b> The meaning is: He bestowed upon him royal favor; an example of this is (Num. 27:20): “And you shall bestow some of your majesty (מֵהוֹדְךָ) upon him,” that everyone said, “This one is fit.” And in Daniel (11:21) it says: “And a contemptible person will stand on his base, upon whom they have not bestowed regal majesty.”
@29
<b>And the words of King David, the first and the last</b> that which happened to David from his beginning to his end.

@30
<b>and the times that passed over him</b> the times of trouble that passed over him. This is what David said, (Ps. 31:16): “My times are in Your hands; rescue me from the hands of my enemies and from my pursuers.”
<b>and over Israel</b> the times that passed over Israel.
<b>and over all the kingdoms of the lands</b> who came upon Israel. An example of this is in I Samuel (7:10): “And the Lord thundered with a great noise, etc., upon the Philistines and threw them into a panic, etc.” So it is with Jehoshaphat: (II Chron. 20:22): “And at the time they began with song and praise, the Lord stationed, etc.,” and so with Sannecherib, (Isa. 37:36): “And they arose in the morning, and behold they were all dead corpses.” (“And when the wicked perish, there is song.” Prov. 11:10).

@10
<b>and I shall go forth before this people and come in</b> And also, a king requires a wise heart to know how to judge, and I am young and tender. Even a thousand wise men would have difficulty judging such a large nation, because it is impossible that they should not have many disputes, which they come to litigate, and he has no time to deliberate on their case, for while this one is complaining and does not stop talking, another one comes and cries. Now who can decide a thousand legal decisions in one day, except one who is wise and astute, endowed with the spirit of God? Therefore, this I request, that You give me wisdom and knowledge to judge this great people of Yours, for this is what I require that You give me.

<b>And who can gather up strength to build Him a house</b> Since he said, “And the House which I am building is great,” perhaps [you may think that] this will mean “great enough for His needs,” but this is not so, for “who can gather strength?” For who can compress and gather his strength enough to build a house fit for Him? An example of this appears above (I Chron. 29:14): “that we should gather up strength to donate.”

In I Kings (7:14), it is written: “He was a widow’s son, of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a Tyrian man.” His mother was from Dan, and his father was from Naphtali. Now why was it necessary to trace his genealogy, from which tribe his father and mother were? This is what is written (Gen. 30:6): “God judged me,” and also (ibid. 8): “I have fought a divine struggle, etc.” Rachel said, “I twisted cords; I went through contortions until I was able to compare to my sister Leah. If Leah will boast of her descendant Bezalel, who will make the Tabernacle, he will require one of the sons of Dan to participate in his work, as it is written (38: 23): ‘And with him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan.’ Now if Solomon, the descendant of my sister, will build the Temple, some of the sons of Dan and Naphtali will have to participate with him.”
<b>and his father was a Tyrian man</b> [This comes] to teach you that even if his mother is a widow, a person must adopt his father’s trade and sustain his mother. (So I heard from Rabbi Solomon the son of Levi of Monteuille, the son of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan’s sister.)

<b>And Solomon counted all the strangers who were in the land of Israel</b> - Heb. הַגֵּירִים. This is written with the plene spelling, two yuds. In the beginning, when David counted them (I Chron 22:2), they were called הַגֵּרִים with one yud, but Solomon counted them at the time of the deed, when he built; therefore, it is written with the plene spelling. A similar instance: “then you shall bring up my bones from this place.” “With you” is missing in the portion of וַיְחִי (Gen. 50:25), but at the time of the deed (in the portion of בְּשַׁלַּח, Ex. 13:19), when he took them, it is written: “with you.”
<b>And Solomon counted, etc., after the census</b> above (I Chron. 22:2), as it is written: “And David ordered to gather the strangers.”
@17
<b>And he made of them seventy thousand, etc.</b> The reason he mentions them again and mentions the number is that he interrupted the topic; therefore, he had to repeat it again now. And he did not stop until he finished the entire [account of the] building, and he says immediately (3:1): “And Solomon commenced to build, etc.” Now, even with one verse, it is customary to interrupt the topic and [then] to begin [again] with the previous statement, e.g., (Num. 16:6): “Do this: take yourself, etc.” And the morrow, it says (ibid. 16f.): “And Moses said to Korah: You and all your band, etc.,” and he repeats and says, “and let each man take his censer and place, etc.” Since he interrupted with many verses, it was necessary to rewrite it, and how much more so here.

@2
<b>And he commenced to build in the second month</b> This is explained at the beginning of Tractate <i>Rosh Hashanah Yerushalmi</i> (1:1), and the meaning is: the second of Iyar. Since he wished to say, “in the fourth year of his reign,” he had to repeat and say, “in the second.” A similar instance is (Gen. 8: 5): “And the waters continued to diminish until the tenth month, etc.” Another similar instance is (I Kings 6:1): “in the fourth year in the month Ziv, which was the second month of Solomon’s reign, etc.” This refers back to “the fourth year,” and then in the fourth year of his reign he commenced in the second [month], because all the days of the winter he could not [build] because of the cold, and in Nissan he could not [build] because of Passover.
@3
<b>the length in cubits, in the first measure</b> And since he interrupted and said “in the first measure,” he says again, “cubits,” i.e., the cubit length of the House was sixty cubits, including the Debir and the Heichal, and the breadth was twenty cubits.
@4
<b>And the vestibule, the length of which was</b> The length of the vestibule, opposite the breadth of the House, was twenty, for the length of the vestibule, which was opposite the breadth of the House, was twenty cubits from north to south, and every larger dimension is called length, and the smaller one is called breadth, and since in the Heichal, its measurement from east to west is larger and from north to south is smaller, it is called the breadth, but in the vestibule, whose measurement from north to south is larger, it is called the length, and its measurement from east to west, which is smaller, is called the breadth, and the breadth of the vestibule was ten cubits, as is delineated in I Kings (6:3): “ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the House.”
<b>and the height was one hundred and twenty</b> But in I Kings (6:2), it is written: “and thirty cubits the height thereof.” How so? The height of the [first] floor from the floor of the house to the ceiling of the first upper story was thirty cubits, and from upper story to upper story up to the highest roof was ninety cubits, as is written: (I Chron. 28:11): “And David gave his son Solomon the pattern of the vestibule and its houses and its treasures and its upper stories.” From there it can be deduced that there were upper stories there.
<b>and he overlaid it from within with pure gold</b> The inside of the Heichal, which was the greater house, he overlaid with gold, but not the vestibule, and he proceeds and delineates further how he did it.
@5
<b>And the greater House</b> He overlaid the entire House with pure gold.
<b>he overlaid with juniper wood</b> - Heb. עֲצֵי בְרוֹשִּׁים. [This translation follows Yehuda Feliks, <i>Nature & Man in the Bible</i>, pp.110f.] For the entire House, the Debir and the Heichal, he first overlaid with juniper wood, and afterwards, “he overlaid it with fine gold” over the walls of juniper, and because of the overlaying of gold, with which he wished to overlay the House, he overlaid it first with wood in order that the gold would adhere firmly, for he would reinforce the gold with nails, with the decorations of the wood, for he made decorations in the wood.
<b>palm trees</b> - Heb. תִּמּרִים. They are trees like a sort of palm trees and cherubim, and in I Kings (6:32) it is written: “and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers (וּפְטוּרֵי צִצִּים),” like (Num. 17:23) “and it sprouted fruit (וַיָּצֵץ צִיץ)”. And פְטוּרֵי is like “A man frees (פּוֹטֵר) his wife (<i>entwerfen</i> in Middle High German). (From Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Meshullam of blessed memory.)
<b>and he overlaid it with gold</b> i.e., When he made all the decorations, he overlaid the walls with gold after the decorations, and he reinforced them with nails in the wooden wall, in order that it should not move; which is something that he could not do on a stone wall. For this reason, he overlaid the entire House with juniper wood.
<b>and chains</b> He made many decorations, filling it completely, and when he saw that there was any blank space between one decoration and another, he painted a decoration like a sort of chain, with which things are connected, so did he do here between one decoration and another, in order that there should be no blank space in between. Another interpretation is that he made real golden chains and connected the shapes together with them.
@6
<b>And he overlaid the House with precious stone</b> He set and inlaid precious stones in gold in the walls of the House for glory and for beauty.
<b>and the gold</b> that he refers to: “and he overlaid it with fine gold,” was of the gold of Parvaim. Parvaim is the name of a place, and our Sages explained that it resembles the blood of bulls in its high quality and its redness.
@7
<b>And he overlaid</b> - Heb. וַיְחַף like וַיְצַף, and he explains what he overlaid in the Housethe walls and the sideposts. and its walls [i.e., the walls] of the sideposts of the House, which were [made] of stones, and he explains: “its walls and its doors with gold.” In I Kings (6:15) it says: “until the walls of the ceiling (קִירוֹת הַסִּפֻּן).” Now this is why he calls the roof קִירוֹת הַסִּפֻּן, because the roof was like an inverted ship (סְפִינָה) or boat, for it is customary to make the ceiling round, like a ship.
@8
<b>And he made the House of, etc.</b> This is what he should have said: “And he made the house of the Holy of Holies twenty by twenty,” [since neither side was longer] but because he said above (verse 4): “And the vestibule, etc. opposite the breadth of the House, was twenty cubits, etc.,” he words it similarly here.
<b>and he overlaid it with fine gold</b> Also in the Holy of Holies, he first built walls of wood, and upon it he overlaid gold, and the reason he does not mention any wood here in the Holy of Holies is due to the greatness of the Temple; i.e., all the walls of the House of the Ark were of gold, and there was no wood in them, and that was honor for the Holy of Holies, and this is proven in Kings (ad loc.). The proof that because of the honor of the House he does not mention any wood is that it is written (verse 6): “And he overlaid the House with precious stone,” whereas in Kings, it is not written: “precious stone.” Why not? Because in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah he lets you know that Solomon’s intention was for the honor of the House.

A similar instance is (Isa. 22:24): הַצֶּאֱצָאִים וְהַצְּפִעוֹת, which is translated by the <i>Targum</i> as: the children, etc. He made the form of boys and girls for cherubim, [based on the Aramaic] כְּרַבְיָא, [meaning like children,] and they were of wood, which he afterwards overlaid with gold, and in I Kings (6:23): “And he made in the Debir two cherubim of olive wood,” but all that was within of wood he does not wish to mention in this Book because of its honor.
@11
<b>And the wings of the cherubim - their length was twenty cubits</b> How so? The wing of one was five cubits, and the end of the five reached the wall of the House to the south, and the other wing reached the wing of the other cherub, which was at its side, totaling ten cubits for one cherub, and so for the other one. It is found that the wing of one cherub reached the north, and the wing of one cherub reached the south. It follows that they were as long as the entire western wall, which was twenty cubits [long]. And concerning their bodies, our Sages said, (<i>Yoma</i> 21a), that they stood miraculously, [i.e., they did not occupy space]. But according to the simple explanation of the matter, it appears to me that their bodies protruded from them like a bird which spreads its wings, that its body protrudes outside its wings, (See <I>B.B.</I> 99a) and their height is delineated in I Kings (6:26): “The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the second cherub.”

<b>with their faces to the House</b> To the inside, for their heads were not erect, so that they should appear as though looking outward, but their heads were bent and looking before them, as it is written (Exod. 25:20): “and their faces [shall be] one toward the other,” but here it says. “with their faces to the House,” but rather their heads were facing each other, and their heads were also bent toward the House, toward the inside, and the Ark was standing in the place of the wing spread of the two cherubim, and the wings of the cherubim were inclined from the wall and shielded the Ark cover and the Ark with their wings. Aside from these cherubim were the cherubim that Moses had made from the Ark cover, still attached and clinging to the Ark cover and standing upon it. Do not be surprised about this, because likewise, Solomon made ten tables and ten candelabra, besides those of Moses.

<b>And he made the dividing curtain of blue, purple</b> and he hung it on the door that was in the cubit between the two partitions, through which they would enter the Holy of Holies. Although it had doors, he hung it upon it as further (4:22): “And the entrance to the House, its inner doors to the Holy of Holies, etc.”
<b>and he wrought cherubim into it</b> pictures of cherubim.
@15
<b>thirty-five cubits long</b> i.e., the height. And in I Kings (7:15): “And he cast the two pillars of copper, eighteen cubits, etc.” Rabbi Solomon (<i>Rashi</i> to Kings) explained that he cast them both together and subsequently divided them in two, and the missing cubit is not counted because it is unlike the work of the rest of the pillar, as is written there in the section (7:22): “And upon the top of the pillars was lily work.” Rabbi Joseph [Kara] also explained it in this manner, but it is not acceptable to me, for what is the meaning of its height being eighteen, but this is how I heard it, that he surely cast them both together, and then divided them in two; so we find that each one was seventeen and a half cubits, and the capital, which was the chapiter, as is stated there, its thickness was half a cubit, making each one eighteen cubits.
<b>and the capital</b> - Heb. וְהַצֶּפֶת. That is the overlay (צִפּוּי) like (verse 10): “and he (sic) overlaid them (וַיְצַפֶּה) with gold.” I.e., it was made like a sort of hollow (conical) hat, whose thickness was half of a cubit from below, and when it is inverted and placed on the pillar, it is found to be eighteen cubits: in I Kings (7:16-20), it is called chapiters (כֹּתָרוֹת), an expression of a crown (כֶּתֶר), as it is written: “And two chapiters (כּתָרוֹת), etc.”
@16
<b>and placed them in the chains</b> He made chains at the top of the capital under it, and within the chains he set forms of pomegranates in order to cover the hollow of the capital, as it is written (ibid. verse 41): “to cover the two bowls (גֻלּוֹת) of the chapiters,” and because of its hollow, he calls them גֻלּוֹת. And concerning the net-work (שְׂבָכָה) written there, these are the chains, an expression of (Job 18:8): “and he shall walk on the nets (שְׂבָכָה),” an expression of branches, like (Gen. 22:13): “caught in the hedge (בַּסְּבַךְ) by its horns.” Some interpret it as coif, and Rabbi Eliezer interprets it as branches.
@17
<b>before the Heichal</b> At the entrance of the Heichal on the outside, in the vestibule, as is proven in I Kings (7:19): “And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the vestibule.”
<b>one from the right</b> of the entrance.
<b>and one from the left</b> of the entrance.
<b>Jachin, etc. Boaz</b> Jachin because of the kingdom of the house of David, which was compared to the moon, as it is written (Ps. 89:38): “Like the moon, which is established (יִכּוֹן) forever.” Boaz, corresponding to the sun, [which emerges with might and strength (עֹז) (<i>Yesod Veshoresh Haavodah</i>)], as it is written (ibid. 19: 6): “it rejoices like a mighty man, running,” (<i>Midrassh Tadshe</i>, ch. 2). The “beth” of בֹּעַז is like the “mem” in (Gen. 5:29) נֹחַ יְנַחֲמֵנוּ and in (I Sam 1:20) שְּׁמוּאֵל כִּי מֵה' שְׁאִלְתִּיו.
<b>and he named the right one Jachin</b> although the moon is smaller than the sun, i.e., that it shou ld help him like an established moon, but not like a diminishing moon. Said Solomon, “If the Holy One, blessed be He, compares my kingdom to the sun and the moon, I too shall make an established and enduring thing, namely, large copper pillars.” Another explanation: Huram, who was one of the sons of Dan, made the pillars. He called one Jachin after his father Samson, about whom Scripture states (Jud. 16:29): “And Samson grasped the two pillars of the center, etc.” And Solomon called the second one Boaz after his grandfather, Boaz. A similar instance is (Gen. 31:47): “And Laban called it Yegar Sahadutha.”

<b>And the likeness of oxen was beneath it</b> And he cast the forms of the likeness of oxen from it to stand upon, and they were fastened to it, as is stated at the end of the verse: “The oxen were cast when it was cast.”
<b>round about, encompassing it; ten cubits encompassing the sea</b> It is not elucidated here what the thing that encompassed them was, but in I Kings (7:24) it is written: “And under the brim were ornamental knobs encompassing it round about, for ten cubits, encompassing the sea round about.” Knobs are like those made for cups, round pomels (apple-shaped) knobs, for the sake of beauty, and beneath its brim and round about, they stood in the three lowest cubits, which were square, and the two round upper ones. And it is impossible to contain [that which Scripture says] (ibid. verse 26): “it contained two thousand bath,” which are the equivalent of one hundred fifty purifying pools, except in this matter, as is delineated in Erubin (13a). And it is impossible to say that the upper ones were square and the lower ones were round, because that which is written: “it was round all about,” refers to its brim, and that which Scripture states about these knobs, “ten cubits” on each side, but where it was round, it is impossible to say, “ten cubits around.”
<b>two rows</b> the knobs were cast when it was cast; all were cast together, not that he attached the knobs after its casting, with nails or with glue, called <i>soldure</i> in Old French, soldering.

<b>it contained three thousand</b> It contained this amount, but in I Kings (7:26) it is written: “It contained two thousand baths.” The heaped measure was a third, for a bath is three seah, as is said: (Ezek. 45:11): “The ephah and the bath shall have one volume.” Thus you have six thousand seah. This equals a hundred and fifty purifying pools for four thousand seah equal a hundred mikvaoth. And we find also for the remaining two thousand seah fifty mikvaoth, and even if you divide the vessel according to the measure that the Rabbis computed, namely a cubit by a cubit by the height of three cubits for a mikvah, you will find the same: for the height of three cubits, which was square, and which was ten by ten from its brim to its brim, are a hundred mikvaoth, and for the height of two cubits, where it was round, ten by ten from its brim to its brim around equal fifty mikvaoth, because a square is a fourth more than a circle.

The lavers were for sanctification and the sea for immersion.
@7
<b>And he made the ten golden candelabra according to their regulations</b> Why is it stated in connection with the candelabra, “according to their regulations”? Because he informs us why he made ten candelabra, and everything he deduced from the Torah: the flowers, the knobs, the almond-shaped cups enumerated in the chapter were seventy, meaning that for each of the ten candelabra were seven lamps. (This is how my mother’s brother, my uncle, Rabbi Klonimos the son of Rabbi Judah explained it, and it is a midrash), and its seven lamps corresponded to the seven planets: Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars.

@13
<b>And the four hundred pomegranates</b> Above (ad loc.), he states: “and he made a hundred pomegranates.” How so? We must explain it in this manner: He surely made four hundred pomegranates, as is stated here, and where it is stated [that he made] a hundred, it means a hundred for each row, for there were four rows, as it is stated: “two rows of pomegranates to one network,” and so two rows of pomegranates to the other network, totaling four rows, and the pomegranates were strung within the networks, which were set and inserted to cover the two bowls of the chapiters.
@14
<b>And he made the bases</b> But in I Kings (7:27), it is written: “And he made the ten bases of copper.” The bases are the bases of the laver, and there their work is explained.

<b>And the pots, and the shovels, and the forks</b> Although we already mentioned it above, he repeats it again, to let us know that they were copper, and also to let us know about the forks, which were not mentioned above.
<b>burnished</b> - Heb. מָרוּק, similar to (Jer. 46:4): “polish (מִרְקוּ) the spears,”; (Lev. 6: 21): “it shall be scoured (וּמרַק) and rinsed with water.” In I Kings (7:45), it is written מְמרָט, like (Lev. 13:40): “whose head will become bald (יִמָּרֵט),” and the <i>Targum</i> renders: fine copper.
@17
<b>in the thickness of the ground</b> The <i>Targum</i> renders: clay, <i>ardille</i> in Old French.
<b>between Succoth and Zeredathah</b> In I Kings (7: 46) it says Zarethan. Zeredathah was the place of Jeroboam, (11: 26): “And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow.” Since a corpse conveys ritual contamination in a tent, and a mezora likewise, and so it is with an idol, as we learned at the end of the third chapter of <i>Abodah Zarah</i> (Mishnah 8). “A widow” means that he widowed [isolated] Israel from its God. “From Zeredah” means that he narrowed the Torah and did not broaden it; i.e., מִן הַצְרֵדָתָה, means הֵצַר דַּת אֱלֹהֵינוּ he narrowed the law of our God. My uncle of blessed memory explained it to me in this manner.
@20
<b>And the candelabra and their lamps</b> To remove [the false idea] from the hearts of those who explain that the lamps were made from the body of the candelabrum and attached to it, because it is written: “and the candelabra and their lamps.” Since Scripture mentions the lamps separately and not the remaining work of the candelabrum separately, namely the cups and the flowers, we deduce that the lamps were not attached, and since they were not attached to it, they appeared like a different work, and it was necessary to mention the lamps, but the other works, which were attached to it, he does not mention because they are called by the name of the candelabrum, and [the reason] he made ten candelabra, ten tables, ten lavers, the cherubim, and all that he made is explained in the Baraitha of Rabbi Phinehas the son of Jair (<i>Midrash Tadshe</i>, ch. 2).
@21
<b>And the flower</b> Our Rabbis explained that this corresponds to the flower that Moses added in the section, “Behaalothecha”: (Num. 8:4) “to its rootstock, to its flower, etc.,” which is not mentioned in “Terumah.”
<b>and the tongs were gold</b> with which they would lift up the wick from the lamp containing oil.
<b>it was fine gold</b> Refined and purified gold, <i>fin</i> in Old French, refined, pure, and in <i>Menahoth</i> (29a) it is explained: out of all the gold that Solomon had, out of the abundance of gold that entered the candelabrum to refine it and purify it and to fulfill the commandment of making a candelabrum of pure gold.

<b>and Solomon brought his father David’s hallowed things</b> Whatever is mentioned in this verse—according to its simple meaning—refers to that which remained to him from the things that David hallowed, as is written above (I Chron. 18:11): “Those also King David dedicated to the Lord, [along] with the silver and the gold that he took from all the nations, etc.,” and that which he left over he deposited into the treasuries of the House of God. And [in] <i>Midrash Aggadah</i> (<i>Pesikta Rabbathi</i> 6:7), some sages say that [he did not use these articles for the building of the Temple] because he knew that it was destined to be destroyed, in order that the nations should not say, “Our deity is strong,” for it took revenge on this House, which was built from the loot and the spoils that David robbed from their heathen temples. Some say: So said Solomon, “There was a famine during the days of David my father for three consecutive years, year after year, and he should have given away these hallowed things to sustain the poor of Israel with them.” I wish to bring support [to the view that Solomon did not build the Temple with the spoils of the nations], for regarding all the devoted things that David dedicated, as is written above (ibid.), it is not stated that with this Solomon made such and such a thing, as it is stated regarding the copper, as it is said (ibid. verse 8): “And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took huge quantities of copper, with which Solomon made the copper sea, etc.,” but of the silver and gold, about which it is not stated that Solomon made anything from it, it may be deduced that he did not make [anything from it]. Therefore, it is not written here any copper, but silver and gold. According to the simple interpretation, it seems to me that Scripture does not mention copper because copper is cheap, and it is not proper or fitting to bring it into the treasuries of the House of God.
@2
<b>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel</b> He conducted [the matter] with the attribute of wisdom, in that he gathered the elders, and not the youths, [which was] better than David [had done,] who gathered even the youths, as it is written, “And David assembled all the leaders of Israel...Jerusalem” (I Chron. 28:1).

<b>on the festival</b> the festival of Succoth.
@5
<b>and the Tent of Meeting</b> that Moses made, Solomon hid it in the treasuries of the House of God with the remaining vessels and the hallowed articles, because he did not need them, and our Sages (<i>Tosefta of Sotah 13:1) said that they were hidden away.</i>
<b>all the sacred vessels that were in the Tent</b> that David had given to the Ark: the priests and the Levites brought them up. This refers back to the above, where Scripture says: “and the Levites bore the Ark,” and he explains: Who were those Levites that I mentioned to you above? The Levitic priests, for the priests are also of the sons of Levi, but they were not real Levites, and so it is written (I Kings 8:3): “and the priests took up the Ark.” And the Levites also brought up the vessels and the Tent of Meeting according to their regulations.
@8
<b>And the cherubim were spreading their wings over the place of the Ark</b> in the place where the Ark was standing Therefore -
<b>and the cherubim covered over the Ark and over its staves from above</b> above the Ark. So were the staves standing, and they extended so far out toward the east, that the Ark could stand exactly beneath the cherubim without the hindrance of the staves. Therefore, “and the cherubim covered over the Ark.” And they also covered part of the staves adjacent to the Ark, but not all of them, because they reached until the east. But you cannot explain that the cherubim covered the entire staves. And also, because of this—
@9
<b>And they extended the staves so that the ends of the staves were seen from the Ark before the Debir</b> For if it were not so, but [if they were] the same; i.e., if they were extended with one measure one from the other, [i.e., the part of the staves extending eastward equaled the part extending westward]. The staves that Moses made were still there, and they stood in the Holy of Holies of the Tent of Meeting, which was only ten [cubits], whereas this was twenty [cubits], and it reached from wall to wall. With the cherubim of Moses, about which it is also written, “spreading and covering,” they did not have to move any part of the staves from their place, because the cherubim of Moses were standing over the Ark on the Ark cover, but as for the cherubim mentioned here-Solomon made them standing on their feet on the ground, but nevertheless, those of Moses were still attached to the Ark cover. This is how Rabbi Nathan explained it, (but our Rabbi explained) that the priests wished to bring the Ark into the Debir with its staves, but they were unable to do so, because the Cloud filled the House of the Lord, and they could not bring the cherubim up to the western wall. Therefore, they [the staves] protruded into the dividing curtain. To me, this poses a difficulty, however, because it is written (I Kings 8:10f.): “And it came to pass when the priests came out, etc.,” and afterwards, “the glory of the Lord filled the House of God (sic).” (Rabbi Joseph of blessed memory, however, explained) that it does not say וַיִּתְאָרְכוּ [in the reflexive conjugation], which would mean that they became elongated by themselves, but וַיַּאֲרִיכוּ [in the causative conjugation], which means that others elongated them, and he explained that the craftsmen elongated them to twenty cubits, and their two ends touched the eastern wall and their [other] two ends touched the western wall. It is, however, puzzling how they could spread out their wings and cover the Ark, which was ten cubits from them.
@11
<b>And it came to pass when the priests left the Holy</b> He should have immediately written, “and the House became full of the cloud of the House of the Lord,” but he interrupted in between, and so in I Kings (8:10): “And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the Holy, and the cloud filled the House of the Lord.”

(Lev. 16:2): “for in the cloud I shall appear on the Ark cover.”

This is the sequence of the verses, and the conclusion of the topic proves it, for he says, “You shall hear from Your abode.” You have thus learned that he built it only with this intention to bring down the Shechinah therein, in order that He dwell on the earth, to hear “from Your abode” the prayer that they will pray therein.

@23
<b>and to justify the righteous</b> not to punish him for the oath, for he swore in truth. <i>Tosefta</i> of <i>Sotah</i> (1: 3) explains [this verse as referring to the rite of the sotah, the married woman accused of adultery Num. 5:11-30)]: If a man sins by being intimate with a married woman. and an oath be exacted of him and an oath makes him guilty, for just as the water tests her, so does the water test him. before Your altar - as it is written (Num. 5:18): “And the priest shall have the woman stand [before the Lord].” to bring his way upon his head - as it is written (ibid. verse 27): “her belly will swell and her thigh will fall away.” and to justify the righteous - (ibid. verse 28): “and she will be blessed with offspring.”

<b>And the priests...on their watches</b> as David had divided them into twenty-four watches, for each watch to serve its week, and the Levites likewise on their twenty-four watches
<b>to give thanks</b> with musical instruments, for they recited (Ps. 136): “Give thanks to the Lord for He is good, for His loving kindness is eternal.”
<b>with David’s praise</b> The musical instruments with which they recited David’s praise and the thanksgivings were in the Levites’ hands.
<b>and the priests were sounding the trumpets opposite them</b> For it was incumbent upon them to play music with the trumpets, as it is said (Num. 10: 8): “And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow [with the trumpets].”
@7
<b>And Solomon consecrated the interior of the court</b> Our Sages differ in this matter (<i>Zeb.</i> 59): Rabbi Judah says: He consecrated the floor of the forecourt with the sanctity of the altar to burn offerings on the floor, because the copper altar was too small to contain [the offerings], because they brought many sacrifices. Rabbi Jose said to him: Was it not already stated (1:6): “And he offered up on it a thousand burnt offerings” on the altar that Moses had made? When you compute the number of cubits and the number of burnt offerings, you will find that this one of stones was larger than that of Moses, for on Moses’ altar, the place of its pyre was a cubit by a cubit, whereas on Solomon’s, the place of its pyre was twenty-four by twenty-four. The result is that Solomon’s [altar] was 576 times as large as that of Moses. If so, what is the meaning of (I Kings 8:64): “the king consecrated the interior of the court”? That he set the stone altar into it, fastened to the floor.
<b>could not contain</b> He is talking about Moses’ [altar], like a person who says, “So and so is a dwarf and is disqualified from performing the sacrificial service.”

<b>And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he dismissed the people</b> which was the ninth [day] of the inauguration of the Temple, but in I Kings (8:66) it is written: “On the eighth day,” which was the twenty-second of the month. The meaning is: On the eighth day he gave them permission to leave after the Feast, and on the morrow, when the Feast was over, they all went [home] together. Another meaning: On the eighth day he gave them permission and dismissed those who lived within the Sabbath limits and whoever wished to travel and go on that day in that limit, and on the following day, he dismissed the entire populace. In <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> (35:3) it is explained that they took his leave but waited there one more day and then they repeated [this procedure] and took leave again a second time; therefore it is said: “on the twenty-third day of the month.”
<b>rejoicing and delighted of heart, etc. for David, for Solomon</b> For that which He spoke with His mouth above (I Chron 28:6): “Your son Solomon - he shall build My House,” He fulfilled with His hand, for He gave him a son sitting on his throne, who built a House in the name of the Lord. And in <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> it is explained: Said Rabbi Levi: It is written: “for the inauguration of, etc.” “Rejoicing” refers to “that the Lord had wrought for David,” viz. that He fulfilled that which He had vowed to Solomon, that He chose him from all his brothers because he was wise.
<b>and for Israel His people</b> it is written in I Kings (8:56): “there has not failed one word, etc.” Another explanation: “and for Israel His people” - they had a ruler, so that they dwelt safely and tranquilly, as it is written (ibid. 5:5): “And Judah and Israel dwelt, etc.”
@12
<b>And the Lord appeared to Solomon at night</b> in a vision of the night.
<b>I have heard your prayer</b> With the wording that Solomon used, “And You shall hear.” The Holy One, blessed be He, answered him: “I have heard your prayer.” He prayed, (above 6:26): “When heaven is closed up.” And the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him, “If I close up.” He prayed concerning famine and locusts, and the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him, “if I command locusts.” He prayed concerning pestilence, and the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him, “or if I send pestilence upon My people, and My people... humble themselves” by praying and seeking My presence and repenting of their evil ways. Hence we have three [responses] corresponding to three [entreaties].

@20
<b>I shall cast from before Me</b> according to the condition between Me and you, viz. (Lev. 26: 14): “But if you do not heed Me.” What does it say there? (verse 31): “And I shall make your sanctuaries desolate.”
<b>and I shall make it a proverb</b> as people compose a proverb about someone who was befallen by misfortune.
<b>and a byword</b> - Heb. וְלִשְׁנִינָה, like (Deut. 6:7): וְשִׁנַּנְתָּם לְבָנֶיךָ, “and you shall teach them.” [It is] an expression of recounting misfortunes. Similarly, the Targum of (Gen. 37:10) וַיְסַפֵּר “And he told,” is וְאִשְׁתָּעֵי, and [the <i>Targum</i> of] וְלִשְׁנִינָה is וּלְשׁוּעֵי.

<b>Now it came to pass at the end of twenty years</b> The meaning is: at the end of twenty years that the entire construction had been completed: that of the House of the Lord seven years and that of his palace thirteen years, as it is written in I Kings (6:38, 7:1).
@4
<b>And he built Tadmor in the desert</b> In I Kings (9:18) it [the name] is written “Tamar,” but read, “Tadmor.” This accounts for that which we learned in Tractate <i>Jebamoth</i> (16a): We may not accept proselytes from the Tarmodites; and in <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> (56:11), in the portion dealing with the binding [of Isaac] it is explained that they aided Israel’s enemies, and because they changed themselves and became worse, the word תָּמָר is used in Kings, an expression of exchange (תְּמוּרָה), for they should have repaid Israel for the kindness that Solomon bestowed upon them, for he built the city of Tadmor for them. Because of Solomon, it is not written here “Tamar,” but “Tadmor,” i.e., an important city, in deference to Solomon’s honor, for it is no honor to Solomon to say here that he built a city which rebelled against him and sinned against him. Therefore, it is written, “Tadmor,” and not “Tamar.”
@5
<b>fortified cities</b> Because they stood on the border, they needed to be fortified.
@9
<b>for his work</b> [i.e.] for the work of his building. Why? All the proselytes were [employed] to do his work, but not the men of Israel, because the Israelites served as soldiers and men of war and the officers of his chariots and his horsemen.
@10
<b>two hundred fifty</b> And in I Kings (9:23): “five hundred fifty,” but [in fact], these two are identical, for there Scripture deducts three hundred and then repeats and counts them again, for there it is written (5:30): “Besides Solomon’s chief officers, etc....three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule,” and here it is written above (2:1): “three thousand six hundred.” We find that what is missing in one verse is added in the other verse. Scripture separates them because the three hundred extra were proselytes, and they were appointed over those three thousand three hundred who ruled over the seventy thousand who bore burdens and the eighty thousand hewers in the mountains (I Kings 5:29), and these two hundred fifty were Israelites, appointed over those three hundred proselytes.
@11
<b>Solomon brought up from the City of David</b> That is Zion, for he let her dwell in the City of David when he married her, and she was there until he completed building his palace.
<b>because they are holy</b> The entire city and all the houses.

@12
<b>on the altar of the Lord</b> This was the copper altar that Solomon built. Some explain that this was the copper altar that Solomon made instead of the copper altar that Moses built, but this is astounding, because it is written (II Kings 16:15): “and the burnt offerings of the entire people of the land, etc. and the blood of every burnt offering, etc. shall be for me to visit,” i.e., the copper altar, which was there heretofore, shall be for me to visit. This proves that Moses’ copper altar was still there.

<b>and the station of his attendants</b> Each one would retain his station and his position, and he would not change it the next day.
<b>and their attire</b> The attire that they would wear tomorrow was not the same as, the attire that they wore today.
<b>and his cupbearers</b> most of his cupbearers.
<b>and his ascent</b> the stairway by which he ascended from his palace to the Temple.
<b>and she was breathless</b> because she thought that there was no wisdom in any of the kingdoms but in her own country and like that of her wise men, because her country was in the east; they were wise because they were stargazers, as is stated in the first chapter of Tractate <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, for Eretz Israel is west of Babylon, and that is what is written (I Kings 5:10): “And Solomon’s wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the children of the east,” for they were in the east, as it is written (Gen. 11: 2): “And it came to pass as they migrated from the east.” (I Kings 5:10) “And all the wisdom of Egypt,” for they were sorcerers, necromancers, and astrologers, and he was wise in divination (טַיִיר). So it is written in <i>Pesikta (d’Rav Kahana</i> p. 33b). The word (טַיִיר) is Arabic, and in <i>Leviticus Rabbah</i> (32:2), in the chapter dealing with the son of the Egyptian (24:10): (Eccl. 10:20): “for a bird of the air shall carry the voice.” This is the raven and refers to the art of bird divination (טוּיאַרִי).

The truth is that its name is אַלְגּוּמִּים, but it is called אַלְמֻגִּים because it melted and bent because of its softness, (like cups, which bend because of their value.)
@11
<b>a path</b> מְסִלּוֹת, stairs. In I Kings (10:12) it is written מִסְעָד, [a support] after the manner that they make for those who ascend by way of elevated places and stairs. Some say that מִסְעָד and מְסִילָה are one and the same.
<b>and harps and psalteries for the singers</b> Some say (Jonathan and Rashi to Kings) for the Levites who sing with musical instruments, and Rabbi Eliezer explained it to mean: for the singers who stroll before the king. A similar case is (I Kings 5:12): “and his songs were a thousand and five.” These were secular songs that he composed to sing before him, and that is what is meant (below 35:25): “And Jeremiah lamented over Josiah, and all the male singers and the female singers recited in their lamentations, etc.”
@12
<b>aside from that which she brought</b> This is written here in deference to the honor of the kings of Judah; it means that she gave him more than he gave her, and in I Kings (10:13) it is written: “aside from that which he gave her according to King [Solomon’s] ability.” [He gave her] things that were common in the land of Israel, but were not common in her country.

@15
<b>because it was brought about, etc. so that the Lord God might establish His word</b> as is delineated in I Kings (11:31–37), to remove from him the ten tribes and to give them to Jeroboam, and this is the meaning of (Gen. 49:10): “The scepter will not depart from Judah” [meaning that] he will not be banished from his kingdom, “until he comes to Shiloh,” meaning until Judah comes to Shiloh to crown Rehoboam there, and there “peoples will gather to him” to crown him, and there the kingdom was divided, and the reign over the ten tribes was lost. Now Shechem is a small city adjacent to Shiloh, as it is written at the end of Judges (21:19): “Behold, there is a sacrifice before the Lord in Shiloh from time to time, etc. on the east side of the highway that goes up from Beth-El to Shechem,” and it is written in Jeremiah (41:5): “from Shechem (and) from Shiloh,” and in honor of the Tabernacle of Shiloh, they would gather in Shechem, which was fit for the people to assemble in, and it adjoined Shiloh. And when they would assemble in Shechem, the scepter would depart from Judah, for there the kingdom was divided.

<b>And the Israelites rebelled against the house of David</b> - Heb. וַיִפְשְׁעוּ, an expression of rebellion. Examples are (II Kings 1:1): “Moab rebelled (וַיִפְשַׁע) against Israel”; (Prov. 18:19): “A rebellious (נִפְשַׁע) brother”; (below 27:19): “then Libnah rebelled (תִּפְשַׁע).”

<b>And King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem</b> And he explains why, because when he was first made king, he was forty-one years old; therefore, he had the strength and the power to strengthen himself. He was a year old when David died, for Solomon reigned forty years, and Solomon had not yet reigned when Rehoboam was born. We find that Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he reigned.

<b>Three years he reigned in Jerusalem</b> and no more, as is proven in I Kings (15:9): “And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Asa reigned over Judah.” We find that he did not reign even three whole years.
<b>Micaiah the daughter of Uriel</b> And above (11:20), he calls her by a different name, Maacah the daughter of Absalom, and in I Kings (15:10), it is likewise written “Maacah the daughter of Absalom.” Micaiah the daughter of Uriel was her [real] name, and here he calls her thus because this is the genealogical record of Judah. In Kings, which is the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, he calls her by her nickname, Maacah the daughter of Absalom. Now, for this reason, they nicknamed her Maacah, rather than call her by her real name, Micaiah, (and the name of her father was Uriel Abishalom). She was called by the name of her daughter-in-law, who was a valiant woman, a heroic woman, as it is written (below 15:16): “And also Maacah the mother of King Asa he removed from being queen,” and in honor of her daughter-in-law, they called the mother-in-law by the daughter-in-law’s name. So it is explained in <i>Yerushalmi</i> (unknown). Now this tradition is in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, and he told me this in the name of his father, and so I found in his father’s commentary: Wherever a “vav” is added to the name of a woman, this is to her praise, like Athaliah (below 22: 12): “and Athaliah reigned over the land,” for she was a valiant woman; similarly Jecaliah (ibid. 26:3) and Jecaliahu (II Kings 15:2), because she was a heroic woman, for Amaziah her husband fled to Lachish and was there fifteen years until he died, and she judged the people all those fifteen years, and later, when he died, they crowned his son Uzziah after him at the age of sixteen.

And all this happened in the ten years about which it is written (above 13:23): “in his time the land was tranquil.” But after those ten years, there was a war between him and Baasha all their lives, for in the third year of Asa, Baasha reigned, and seven years there was peace between them, and so it is proven here as well (verse 5): “and there was no war with him in these years.” But in the other years there was war with him, and below (15:19) it is written: “And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.” We can, however, explain that the war that he had with the Cushites was not until the thirty-fifth year of his reign, but this is difficult to me, for it is written below (16:1): “In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha...advanced,” until (verse 9): “you have dealt foolishly concerning this, for from now on there will be wars with you.” It appears from here that prior to this, he did not have wars, and he lived after that only five years, and in I Kings 15:32, it is written: “And there was war between Asa and Baasha, etc. all their lives.” In <i>Seder Olam</i> (ch. 16) it is explained clearly.

<b>let no man rule against You</b> Let not our enemies - man - have human strength to rule (עִמְּךָ) with You, i.e., against You, to be victorious, so that they should not say, “We have defeated their God.” Another explanation from the Rabbi: Let not the weak one (אֱנוֹשׁ) be held back (יַעְצר), for we are weak, deprived of strength, keeping us back (עוֹצְרֵי יָד) from defeating them. And an example is (Deut. 11:17): “and He will hold back (וְעָצַר) the heaven”; (Gen. 20:18): “For the Lord had held back (וְעָצר עָצַר),” and like (Jud. 13:16): “If you take me in (תַּעְצְרֵנִי).”

<b>And there was no war, etc.</b> We learned in Seder Olam (ch. 16): “In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s kingdom, Baasha, the king of Israel, advanced.” Is it possible to say so? Had not Baasha already died in the twenty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, as it is written (I Kings 16:8): “In the twenty-sixth year of Asa, king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha reigned”? What then is the meaning of “In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s kingdom”? This corresponds to the thirty-six years from the time that Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter, for so it is written (I Kings 2:39-46): “and two of Shimei’s slaves ran away... And the king commanded Benaiah etc. and he smote (Sic) and fell upon him,” and immediately following this Scripture writes about Solomon’s marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter, i.e., immediately after those three years, and in the fourth year he married her, and he reigned forty years. We find that she was with him thirty-six years, and corresponding to them were the thirty-six years that the decree was issued upon the kings of Aram to be adversaries to Israel and finally to fall into the hand[s] of David’s sons. Therefore, it is stated: “In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s kingdom.” In the sixteenth year of his reign, after Zerah the Cushite fell into his hand[s], that is the thirty-sixth year from Solomon’s death, and in the sixteenth [year] of Asa, the king of Israel and the king of Aram made a treaty to advance and provoke Asa. Asa sinned, as it is stated (16:2f.): “And Asa brought out silver and gold... saying, ‘Make (sic) a treaty between me and you...’ And Ben Hadad heeded.” And the kings of Aram did not cease being adversaries to Israel until Ahaz died, and in the third year of Ahaz, the king of Israel and the king of Aram made a treaty to advance and provoke Ahaz, and Ahaz had no merit that they should fall into his hand[s]; so they both fell into the hand [s] of Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria.

This is the most accurate interpretation, but others explain “first” as meaning superior to Solomon and Rehoboam. Regarding Solomon, it is written (I Kings 11:4): “his wives turned away his heart” at the end of his days, and he built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.” Regarding Rehoboam, it is written (above 12:1): “And when he became strong, he abandoned the Law of the Lord.” [Jehoshaphat was also not] like Abijam, about whom it is written (I Kings 15:2): “and his heart was not complete with the Lord, his God,” or like Asa, who did not rely on the Lord; [Jehoshaphat] resembled his father, David, who had only one heart for his Father in heaven.

In regards to Samuel, it says, (I Sam. 2: 21): “And the lad Samuel grew up with the Lord.” God forbid that it should say, גָדוֹל עִם ה', he was great with the Lord. Here too, he [Jehoshaphat] became great to an unusual degree, גָדֵל עַד לְמָעְלָה. It is therefore improper to say וְגָדוֹל, great. The same applies to Isaac.

But when our forefathers in Moses’ time seized Gilead, they were silent and refrained from taking it, because they did not care for it, or perhaps in Moses’ time, they did take it, but later the nations took it from Israel’s hands, but it is [in fact] ours.

<b>And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred</b> And they were all true prophets, for he gathered for Jehoshaphat that which he had requested of him. And this is proven in the closely following text (verse 20f.): “And a spirit came forth, etc. and said: ‘I will entice him...and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets,’ for I will inspire them to say to Ahab: Ascend, and the Lord will deliver it into the hands of the king.” From here we can deduce that they were prophets of the Lord, for they prophesied only the word of the Lord, for if they were false prophets, they would not entice, for they would prophesy only that which they were inventing from their minds. Moreover, Jehoshaphat later said, “Is there no other prophet of the Lord?” I know that they are prophets of the Lord, but I have a tradition from my grandfather’s house that two prophets do not prophesy in the same style and with the same language, but all of these [prophets] are [unanimously] prophesying, “Ascend and prosper.”

<b>and seated in a threshing floor</b> He is telling us that when the prophets prophesied before them, they were sitting outside the city, and spies of the king of Aram came there and heard that he [the prophet] informed the king of Israel that he alone would fall in battle. That is the reason that the king of Aram commanded his forces (v. 30): “Attack neither small nor great; only the king of Israel,” to fulfill the words of Micaiah. That is why it is written, “in a threshing floor,” for it was a place where spies could spy. If the meeting had been inside the city, the spies of the king of Aram would not have been able to infiltrate, for they would have detected that they were spies; but when they were outside the city, even if they [the Israelites] became aware of them, they could say, “We are going elsewhere, and the reason we drew near to the threshing floor is because of the great tumult and gathering of the armies here at the gate of the city; we were amazed, and turned off the road to see what was going on.” Consequently, the spies informed the king of Aram [what they had heard], who commanded to slay no one but the king of Israel. Otherwise, why did it enter his mind to command not to slay anyone of Israel, but the king? But he had spies who had heard Micaiah saying, (verses 16f.): “I saw all the Israelites scattered, etc. And the Lord said: These have no master.” This was a sign that the king would be slain, and that the Israelites would return each one to his house in peace. And they heard that he said, (v. 27): “If you return in peace...” The spies heard all and informed the king of Aram. The king of Aram then commanded to act in accordance with the word of Micaiah, and to slay only the king.

Comm. Dig. ad loc.] He preceded this account by stating, “and all the host of heaven were standing,” so that you should not wonder when you read, “And a certain spirit came forth,” who he was and where he came from. When he says, “and all the host of heaven were standing,” it is to inform you where he came from: from among the rest of the spirits standing beside Him. Our Rabbis (<i>Sanh.</i> 89a, <i>Targum</i>) however, explained that this was the spirit of Naboth.

<b>but you may wear your garb</b> The royal costume and the coat of mail and the royal weapons, for there is no need for anyone to be wary of the prophet’s words except the king of Israel, for his [the king of Aram’s] spies told [him] the words of Micaiah.

<b>and Jehoshaphat cried out</b> He called to his troop and his armies to come to his aid, [using] the sign of the lion on his banner or the banner of the sons of Judah. And so is the custom when two troops engage in battle: each troop gives a name to the insignia of its division for the troop that is with it, so that if they separate from each other or if the troops mingle with one another, each troop shouts the name of its insignia, and they recognize the insignia and all gather together and become one group as originally. He did not, however, cry out to his God, as is proven from I Kings (22:32), for there it does not say, “and the Lord helped him, and God enticed them away from him,” but it is written, “And it was, etc.”
@32
<b>And it was when the officers of the chariots saw that he was not the king of Israel</b> for they immediately recognized and understood when he cried out the insignia of his division, as was explained. As soon as they recognized him, they turned away from him in accordance with the order of the king of Aram, and it was from the Lord that they recognized him.

And he did not even aim at him, for it is written, “innocently.” Perforce, you must say that the archer was an Israelite who intended to shoot at the camp of Aram, and inadvertently hit the king of Israel.

@5
<b>And he appointed judges</b> When the seer told him, “good things were found in you, for you abolished the asheroth,” he approached the Sepher Torah [to see] whether he had abolished them properly. He first saw that it was written (Deut. 12:2f.): “You shall utterly destroy...and you shall burn their asherim with fire and cut down the images of their gods,” and he remembered that it is written in כִּי תִשָׂא (Exod. 34:13): “And you shall break down their monuments, etc.” He wondered why he had pleased the Lord by abolishing the asherim, the Jewish asherim, for [the Torah] only warned about their asherim. He went back to [the Torah portion] (Deut. 16:18): “Judges and law enforcing agents,” and found written (verse 21): “You shall not plant an asherah.” Then he rejoiced that he had abolished them. He also saw written there: “Judges and law enforcing agents you shall appoint for yourself,” and immediately “he appointed judges,” strong ones.
<b>in all the fortified cities of Judah, for every city</b> He first appointed strong [judges] in all the fortified cities of Judah to coerce them [the people] and compel them to [accept] judgment. He later appointed judges who were not as strong for the cities that were not fortified, for they [the inhabitants] were more afraid to rebel than those who dwelt in the fortified cities, for they felt secure in their fortified cities.

<b>for you do not judge for man</b> The meaning is: Do not think in your heart: What difference does it make if we pervert the law to declare our friends innocent and pervert the rights of the poor and favor the rich? Is it not so that the judgment is not for the Lord? Therefore, it says, “for the Lord.” It is for Him. If you convict the innocent, it is as though you take from your Creator’s property and pervert the law of Heaven, by bestowing a distorted verdict. Therefore, “see what you are doing,” and may your heart be in every judgment, as if the Holy One, blessed be He, is standing before you in judgment, and this is the meaning of: “and [He] is with you in the matter of the judgment.” In <i>Sanhedrin</i> (6b) it is stated “What are you doing, for you do not judge for man but for the Lord.” This is explained [as follows]: Perhaps the judge will say, “How does this problem concern me?” Therefore, Scripture states: “and it is with you concerning the matter of the judgment,” i.e., it is incumbent upon you to rule justly. And the judge must deal only with that which he sees with his own eyes.

Because they changed their dress and their language to resemble that of the Ammonites and mingled with them, and came to wage war against Israel. This can be proven below in the chapter (verse 22): “And at the time they commenced, etc. the Lord placed liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir.” We find that the Ammonites mentioned here are Amalekites who changed their tongue and their dress. This is what the Kallir set down in the section of Zachor: Remember the tyrant who hid among the Ammonites; he breached the vineyards of Ein-Gedi when he was brought, i.e., remember what Amalekite the tyrant did - he hid among the Ammonites and came to breach the vineyards of Israel at that time, as it is written: “and behold they are in Hazazon-Tamar which is Ein-Gedi,” and Ein-Gedi is close to the territory of Amalek, as is stated in (Gen. 14:7): “and they struck down the whole field of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwell in Hazazon- Tamar.”

@8
<b>In his days, Edom rebelled, etc.</b> For David had destroyed all the males in Edom, and he appointed governors over them instead of a king, and they paid him tribute, and all the kings of Judah did similarly: they appointed governors who pleased them. And from the days of Joram and thereafter, they [the Edomites] rebelled against the authority of Judah.
@9
<b>who surrounded him</b> He smote those Edomites who surrounded him and supported him to aid him, for it was their custom that when they were victorious in war, they would seize the mighty men and bring them with them lest they join their enemies to aid the Edomites, their countrymen. In this case, he got up at night suddenly and slew them. Our Sages, however, explained “those who surrounded him” as “those near him.”
@10
<b>And Edom rebelled</b> Was it not already stated above (verse 8): “In his days, Edom rebelled?” But this is the manner of Scripture: because a verse is interposed, and it now wishes to continue with “then Libnah rebelled,” it repeats the [original words] stating, “And Edom rebelled.”
<b>then Libnah rebelled</b> It belonged to Judah, and it was situated on the border of Edom, as is written in the Book of Joshua (15:21, 42): “And the outermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom.” When they saw that the Edomites rebelled, they too rebelled, for they lived on the border of Edom, and they aided Edom. This is [the meaning of] “then Libnah rebelled.”
<b>because he had forsaken the Lord, the God of his forefathers</b> [Scripture] explains what it was that caused them to rebel in his time more than during [the time of] the rest of the kings of Judah who preceded him.
@11
<b>and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray</b> - Heb. זְנוּת. It is appropriate to use the term harlotry in connection with anyone who forsakes and exchanges the fear of the Holy One, blessed be He, for the idolatry of star and planet worship - for such a person behaves in the manner of a promiscuous woman who commits adultery with others, and similar to this are (Deut. 31:16): “and this people will rise and go astray (וְזָנָה) after the foreign gods of the land”; (Hos. 1:2): “for the land will go astray (זָנה תִזְנֶה), etc.”

The Holy One, blessed be He, did not wish to honor him by making a burning for him, and he was also not buried in the graves of the kings.
@20
<b>and he departed joyless</b> The meaning is: all his life he was in distress and in illnesses, and with him was fulfilled (Deut. 30:15): “See, I have set before you today life, etc.” and (Job 14:1) “short of days and full of fear.”

<b>forty two years old</b> But in II Kings (8:26), Scripture says: “twenty-two years old.” How is this possible? Moreover, according to this, the son was two years his father’s senior, [because Joram ascended the throne at thirty-two and died eight years later, making him forty years old upon his death,] but two years before Joram his father was born, this decree was issued upon the house of David that it would end with the house of Ahab, and so Scripture states (below verse 7): “And from God was Ahaziah’s downfall, etc.” and on the day that Asa took Omri’s daughter for Jehoshaphat his son, this decree was issued. So it was taught in <i>Seder Olam</i> (ch. 17) and in the <i>Tosefta</i> of <i>Sotah</i> (12:3). But throughout Scripture we do not find that Jehoshaphat married Omri’s daughter, but I did find (above 18:1): “and he allied himself in marriage with Ahab,” and perhaps that was his sister that he married, and in the thirty first year of Asa he married her, as it is said in (I Kings 16:23): “And (sic) in the thirty-first year of Asa, etc. Omri reigned.” And when Asa married his daughter to Jehoshaphat his son, Omri gained importance, and they slew Tibni. Figure from the thirty-first year of Asa until Ahaziah reigned, and you will find forty two years. Further, one verse states (II Kings 8:25): “In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, etc., Ahaziah the son of Joram reigned,” and another verse states (ibid. 9:29): “And in the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king.” Perforce, his father did not die until the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab, because it is written (ibid. 8: 16f.): “In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, etc., Joram the son of Jehoshaphat became king, etc., and he reigned eight years.” And that which Scripture states further, “In the eleventh year of Joram,” is because he reigned one year during his father’s lifetime since his father was smitten with severe illnesses, as it is written (above 21:18.): “And after all this, the Lord plagued him, etc.” (22: 1) “And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king,” for one year during his father’s lifetime, and that is what is written: “In the eleventh year of Joram.” And where Scripture says: “In the twelfth year of Joram,” it means that after his father died, it was the twelfth year of Joram.
@5
<b>and the Arameans smote Joram</b> - Heb. הָרַמִּים, like הָאֲרַמִּים. In many places the “aleph” is missing, as for instance (II Sam. 19:14): “And to Amasa you shall say (תֹמְרוּ).” And sometimes the “aleph” is added to a word, for instance (Ps. 89:1): “Ethan the Ezrahite (הָאֶזְרָחִי),” like הַזַּרְחִי, [descendant of Zerah], and the “aleph” of (Job 13:17): “and to my speech (וְאַחְוָתִי) in your ears.”
@6
<b>because of the smiters who smote him</b> כִּי הַמַּכִּים. The meaning is: מִן הַמַּכִּים, because of the smiters, and so it is in II Kings (8:29).

@8
<b>and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers</b> He does not mention Ahaziah’s brothers because they were slain in the days of Joram their father, as it is written (above 21:17): “And they marched upon Judah and split it, etc., and no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.”
@10
<b>she arose and destroyed</b> - Heb. וַתְּדַבֵּר, an expression of דֶּבֶר, pestilence. In II Kings (11:1), it is written: וַתְּאַבֵּד. Concerning this generation, David recited: (Ps. 12:1): “For the conductor on the sheminith,” for David foresaw with the holy spirit that in the eighth generation [of his dynasty] all his descendants would be slain by Athaliah, for there are eight generations from Solomon till here. And he prayed that his seed would survive for a remembrance, and said, (ibid. verse 2): “Save, O Lord, for the pious are gone, etc.” In II Kings (11:2), Scripture states that she killed them by poisoning them, for it is written: “and she stole him away from the dying (הַמְמוֹתִים) children of the king”; we read: הַמּוּמָתִים the slain. Both the traditional reading and the masoretic text have authority. הַמּוּמָתִים means that they already died, and the masoretic text in which the word used is הַמְמוֹתִים means that they were dying in agony. This is written in the continuous present tense, i.e., not all at once but continuously being crushed by illnesses, and then dying. An example is (Jer. 16:4): “Dying of (מְמוֹתֵי) sicknesses they shall die, etc. and with famine,” because they too will not die immediately.
@11
<b>in the bed chamber</b> The <i>Targum</i> [<i>Jonathan</i> to II Kings 11:2] renders: in the chamber of the beds, i.e., in the forecourt, in the room where the priests sleep, but Rabbi Solomon of blessed memory (Rashi ad loc) explained it as the attic of the Holy of Holies, as it is written in Kings (verse 3): “And he hid with her in the House of the Lord, etc.,” and concerning him, David said, (Ps. 27:5): “For He will hide me in His Tabernacle, etc.” He calls it the bed chamber based on (Song 1:13): “between my breasts he will lie,” and that is what the Kallir, Rabbi Eliezer Kara composed (in Zichronoth for the first day of Rosh Hashanah in the section devoted to the letter “nun”): If He said to cause them to totter, the smashing of the bed-chamber He will remember for an atonement. The destruction of the Temple will atone for them.

Jehoiada detained the watch that was leaving with the watch that was coming in, and divided them into three divisions.

A similarity to [the word פָּטַר] is found in (I Chron. 9:33): “in the chambers, who are exempt (פְּטוּרִים)”; i.e., they were exempt from all work in the forecourt, for day and night it was incumbent upon them to perform the work to guard the forecourts and the chambers; they were therefore exempt from all other work in the forecourt.

<b>and the testimony</b> This is a Sepher Torah, and so Scripture states (Deut. 17:19): “and he shall read from it as long as he lives.” Our Sages stated (<i>Abodah Zarah</i> 4a), however, that the crown itself was the testimony, for it would not fit anyone unfit for the throne.
@13

In the midrash (<i>Exod. Rabbah</i> 8:2, <i>Tan.</i> Buber, <i>Va’era</i>) it is explained that, because he hid in the Holy of Holies and was not harmed, they said, “You are fit to be a god.”

<b>and hasten to the matter,” but the Levites did not hasten</b> It is explained in II Kings (12:6f.) that the king said, “Let the priests take [the money] for themselves, each one from his acquaintance,” but they neglected to impose upon their acquaintances, and when the king saw this, he said to them, (ibid. verse 8): “Do not take money from your acquaintances [any longer], but deliver it for the repairs of the House.” This is what is written here: “’and hasten to the matter,’ but the Levites did not hasten.”

<b>For the wicked Athaliah—her sons had breached</b> He had to say this because Solomon had built it as a new sturdy edifice. Only 125 years elapsed from the time that Solomon built it until the days of Joash and it was already breached. Had Athaliah and her sons not breached it, it would have continued to endure, for more than 200 years elapsed from Joash to Josiah and they did not have to repair it until Josiah, although Joash did not make it new as it was originally. One hundred and twenty-five years elapsed from the completion of the Temple until Joash. How so? Solomon reigned 40 years, and in the fourth year of his reign he commenced to build it. It took 7 years to build, totaling 10 years, leaving him 30. Rehoboam reigned 17, totaling 47; Abijah 3, totaling 50; Asa 41, totaling 91; Jehoshaphat 25, totaling 116; Jehoram 8, totaling 124, and Ahaziah one, totaling 125. And from Joash until Josiah were 200 years. How so? Amaziah reigned 29 years, Uzziah 52, Jotham 16, Ahaz 16, Hezekiah 29, Manasseh 55, Amon 2, totaling 200 less 1, in addition to those years that Joash lived after he had repaired the Temple. We find that they would not have had to repair the damage of the Temple had not the wicked Athaliah and her sons breached it.
<b>For Athaliah, etc.</b> It is therefore no wonder that it needed repairs so soon, and also no wonder that there was no hallowed silver and gold in the treasuries of the House of the Lord, so that they had to make an announcement in Judah and Jerusalem to bring the tax, for they had also used all the hallowed things of the House of the Lord for the baalim.
@8
<b>and they made one chest</b> and in II Kings (12:10), it is written: “and he bored a hole in its door,” and through that hole they would cast the hallowed things, but they did not open the door lest a thief come and steal from it.

@11
<b>and when they saw that there was much money</b> then the king’s scribe came.
<b>and the appointee of the head priest</b> The servant appointed under the head priest, who was the assistant to the high priest, together with the king’s scribe. In II Kings (12:11), it is written: “the king’s scribe and the high priest went up.” The meaning is that the king’s scribe went up, and the high priest also sent his appointee, who was the scribe who wrote what the high priest commanded him, because it was unfitting and degrading for the high priest to go with the king’s servants.
<b>empty the chest</b> - Heb. וִיעָרוּ. A similar instance is (Gen. 24:20): “and emptied (וַתְּעַר) her pitcher.”
<b>carry it</b> Every day, when they saw that there was much money in it, they would bring it to the king’s appointee within the forecourt, empty it, carry it, and return it to its place outside the gate of the Lord.

A similar instance is (Prov. 27:22): “If you crush a fool in a mortar [among grain with a pestle (בַּעֱלִי)”]. Rabbi Isaac the son of Samuel of Narbonne told me this. Others say that וְהַעֲלוֹת refers to boards upon which meat is cut, and an example of this appears in Bezah (1:5): We may not move a board (עלי) to cut meat upon it.
<b>and spoons and gold and silver vessels</b> But in II Kings (12:14) it is written: “But there would not be made for the House of the Lord silver pitchers.” How is this possible? It is explained in <i>Kethuboth</i>, chapter 13 (106): Rav Huna inquired of Rav: May vessels of ministry be made of material hallowed for the repair of the Temple, etc.
@20
<b>above the people</b> Higher than the people, in order to make his voice heard. In <i>Lamentations Rabbah</i> (Proem 23), it is interpreted as meaning that he relied on himself; he was a prince higher than all the people, a prophet and a priest, and it was Yom Kippur, and he was the king’s son-in-law, and he was not afraid to say the prophecy. Concerning this incident, it was stated (Lam. 2:20): “shall priest and prophet be slain in the Sanctuary of the Lord?”
@22
<b>and upon his death, he said, “May the Lord see and requite.”</b> For they have slain me only because I spoke as the Omnipresent’s medium, and since I have been slain for His sake, it is proper and fitting that He requite my blood. And so it was: his blood was immediately requited, for “it came to pass at the turn of the year, etc.”
@23
<b>And it came to pass at the turn of the year</b> Because the sons of Judah sinned more than the other tribes, as it is written above (verse 18): “And they forsook the House of the Lord, the God of their fathers.”
<b>and they destroyed all the princes of the people</b> This refers back to the above (verse 17): “And after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and prostrated themselves to the king,” and caused Joash to sin after them. Because of that, they were paid in kind: the army of Aram came and destroyed all the princes of the people.
<b>from among the people</b> from being a people.
@25
<b>for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest</b> Because of the blood of Zechariah, who was the son of Jehoiada, for he should have remembered the favors and the loving-kindness that Jehoiada had bestowed upon him, and because of that iniquity, his servants conspired against him and slew him in his bed. They meted out to him a measure corresponding to a measure. Because Zechariah was slain, tranquil and secure, with nothing to worry about, for he was the son of Jehoiada, and out of respect for him [Jehoiada], they respected him [Zechariah], and spilled his blood onto the ground, therefore, he [Jehoash] too was slain in tranquility and security in his bed.

<b>the Moabitess</b> What difference does it make who they were and from whom they were descended? However, [Scripture means that] those ingrates who did not show their gratitude for the favor of Abraham our father to Lot their father, who fought with the kings when he heard that Lot was captured, and they hired Balaam to curse his sons; [they were chosen] to punish Joash, who [similarly] did not show gratitude to Jehoiada and slew his son Zechariah. It is explained this way in <i>Mechilta</i> (Exod. 17:8).

<b>and the hostage children</b> For the Jews did not permit Amaziah to be king any longer in Jerusalem until he made the children of the officers hostages so that they would no longer rebel against him, and so did Jonathan translate it in II Kings (14:14): “the children of the officers.” Rabbi Joseph (Kara) explained “the hostage children” to mean those hostages that the king had taken as security so that their fathers would not rebel against him. This, however, does not appear correct to me because we do not find that Judah had such power over others that they could have [forced them] to give Judah their children as hostages.
@27
<b>And from the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord</b> and was immediately defeated by the king of Israel.
<b>they conspired against him in Jerusalem</b> to kill him, because each one was grieved over his son, his brother, and his kinsman who were slain because of him, because he provoked the king of Israel.
<b>and he fled to Lachish</b> a fortified city against which Sennacherib waged war. He fled to Lachish, where he remained fifteen years until they followed him to Lachish and assassinated him there. And during those fifteen years that he was in Lachish, Jecoliah, Uzziah’s mother, reigned in his stead. This is how it appears to me. In the commentary of Rabbi Joseph (Kara), I saw that during those fifteen years that he was in Lachish, Uzziah his son reigned in his stead, but it is incorrect to interpret it in this manner, for it is written immediately following (26:1): “who was sixteen years old.” We find that when his father fled, he was only one year old. Moreover, if this is the case, it should say, “took Uzziah and made him king instead of his father during his lifetime.” Rather, Scripture intimated that he did not reign during his father’s lifetime.

And if Jotham the son of Uzziah were with me, we would take upon ourselves the sins of all the generations from Abraham until the end of all generations, for in all the kings before him and after him we find sin, except in Jotham.

It is not written in the Torah that a sacrifice requires musical accompaniment (lit., song), but it is the commandment of the Lord, which He commanded through His prophets to accompany the sacrifice with song. Our Rabbis explained in Tractate <i>Arachin</i> (11a): From where do we derive that the Levites are required to play musical instruments? For it is written (Num. 4:47): “the service of the service.” Which is a service that requires another service with it? This is music with a musical instrument. “And the service of raising” may also be correctly explained in reference to song, as it is written (I Chron. 15:22): “And Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites in song (בְּמַשָּׂא) etc. because he was an expert,” for he was appointed to raise the voice of the melody of the song.

@34
<b>Only the priests were few</b> i.e., Those who had consecrated themselves were still few; so their kinsmen, the Levites, reinforced them until the work was completed and until the priests consecrated themselves. Now, should you ask: How was it that the Levites consecrated themselves and the priests did not consecrate themselves? Scripture explains: “for the Levites were more conscientious than the priests to consecrate themselves”; the Levites were more conscientious than the priests, for the priests and the Levites and all God-fearing people had disguised themselves and made themselves appear unrecognizable, and had even hidden, all the days of the wicked kings, and when Hezekiah - who was righteous - came, they could not immediately consecrate themselves and cleanse themselves, for this was in the first year of his reign; so they came and consecrated themselves gradually, as it is written (Prov. 28:12): “When the righteous rejoice, there is much glory, but when the wicked rise up, a person disguises himself,” and it is written (ibid. verse 28): “When the wicked rise up, people hide; but when they perish, the righteous increase.” When the wicked Ahaz rose up, people hid, but when he perished, the righteous increased, i.e., Hezekiah and his company.

<b>For they could not perform it at that time</b> in the first month, in Nissan.
<b>for the priests had not consecrated themselves sufficiently</b> They had not consecrated themselves sufficiently for Israel to offer their Passover sacrifices, and it goes without saying that they could not perform it in Nissan, for they did not finish consecrating the Temple until the sixteenth of Nissan, but this is its meaning: For they could not perform it at that time; i.e., even if they had not delayed the purification of the Temple, which they did not complete until the sixteenth of Nissan, they would not have been able to perform it now [the offering of the Passover sacrifice] because not enough priests had consecrated themselves.

@6
<b>so that He may return to the remnant that has escaped from the clutches of the kings of Assyria</b> Although they had not yet been exiled, he calls them a remnant that has escaped because they considered themselves as if they had already been exiled, and moreover, the kings of Assyria had seized everything in the days of Ahaz, and the reason they saw themselves as if they had already been exiled was that for six years the Israelites were tribute-paying serfs to the king of Assyria, and he ruled over them and led them away into exile and did with them as he wished. This occurred within those six years, and they had already been exiled many times in the days of the kings of Israel and Ahaz, and they knew that as soon as Israel would rebel against the king of Assyria, he would lead them away in exile. He calls them ‘those who escaped from Assyria’ because he ruled neither over them, nor over the entire land of Judah.
@7
<b>And do not be like your fathers or like your brothers</b> The meaning is: Now if you say, “We still trust that the king of Assyria will withdraw from us,” do not be like your fathers, every generation that was before you. What happened to them when they forsook the Lord and acted treacherously? “He made them a desolation, as you see.”
@9
<b>For when you return to the Lord, your brothers and your sons will find compassion before their captors and shall return to this land</b> Even those few who have already been exiled, for they waged war with Israel and they overwhelmed them, and they led their sons and daughters into captivity. But if you return to Him, He will grant them compassion before their captors, that they will return to this land, for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful.

<b>the altars for incense</b> a place where there were priests and Levites.
@15
<b>and the priests and the Levites were embarrassed</b> that they had delayed to consecrate themselves. They tarried so long and did not come until now for the following reason: they could not believe that this was true beforehand, because Ahaz had dismissed them from officiating as priests. And so they said, “Is it possible that yesterday Ahaz worshipped idols, and that his son Hezekiah, immediately in the first year and first month would tell the priests and Levites to worship the one God alone and have need of us?” They were therefore lazy and neglected to come, together with the rest of Judah, whom Ahaz had dismissed. But when they investigated and understood that everything was for the name of Heaven, they all came and consecrated themselves.
@16
<b>the priests sprinkled</b> For [the rituals] from the reception [of the blood] and onwards are the commandments of the priests, and do not wonder why the owners themselves did not slaughter [the sacrifices], as is explained further.
@17
<b>For there were many among the congregation who had not consecrated themselves</b> and the Levites presided over the slaughter of their Passover sacrifices.
<b>for everyone who was unclean</b> a Levite took his place to sanctify it for the Lord.

<b>for they ate the Passover sacrifice not as it is written</b> not in accordance with halachah, for they ate it in a state of uncleanness, for Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, etc.
@19
<b>who has set his whole heart</b> So it is explained in the Baraitha of Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Jose the Galilean which commences: Wherever you find the words of Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Jose the Galilean in Aggadah, listen attentively, as it is said (Prov. 2:2): “To make your ear attentive to wisdom” of the thirty-two methods by which the Aggadah is expounded, and this is one of them:. If the sequence was separated, e.g. this one: The good Lord will atone for anyone who has set his whole heart to seek God to perform His Passover sacrifice, to offer up his sacrifice—even though they did not offer it with the purity of sacred things, for they had not purified themselves; the entire Judah had purified themselves because they were near Jerusalem, and they could cleanse themselves and consecrate themselves and return to Jerusalem, but many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun were not so much to blame in the matter, because the matter was far away for them through letters, and they did not have time to wait and to delay their coming until they consecrated themselves. They therefore came and were not purified. And because it was not their fault, therefore atone for them. Similarly, (Isa. 35:1f.): “Desert and wasteland shall rejoice over them, etc.”: the sequence is separated.
@21
<b>and the priests with powerful instruments</b> with trumpets.
@22
<b>who were experts in the service of the Lord</b> it is appropriate to use the term “expertise” (שֵׂכֶל) in regards to song, as it is written, (above I Chron. 26:14): “And the lot to the east fell to Shelemiah, and Zechariah, his son, a prudent counselor, etc.,” (יוֹעֵץבְּשֵׂכֶל). Hezekiah spoke to their hearts with consolations and pleasant words to encourage them and assist them, in order that they too strengthen the song with expertise for the Lord.
<b>and thanking the Lord</b> over the thanksgiving offerings, and they thanked the Lord for the miracle that He had wrought for them, for the thanksgiving offering comes for a miracle.

<b>for the congregation one thousand bulls, etc.</b> and they were eating together, the king, the officers, and the people, with joy.
@26
<b>for since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had not been the like in Jerusalem</b> It is possible that a greater multitude had come for the festival to Jerusalem in the days of Solomon, but there had never been such a great rejoicing as this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon. They were joyful about this [gathering], for if they had gathered in Jerusalem on every festival, it would have been nothing new and they would have had no cause for [special] joy But now, since they had not performed the festival pilgrimage to Jerusalem all the days of Ahaz and the wicked kings of Judah, and they were now permitted to go up to Jerusalem they rejoiced greatly. And since it was so many years since they had gone to Jerusalem, the seven days of the Festival of Matzoth were too few in their eyes and they added another seven days in which to rejoice, and they rejoiced a great rejoicing.
@27
<b>and they blessed the people</b> If you wish, you may say that they blessed them with this [blessing] that they begged to return from the land of their captors, and the Lord hearkened to their voice and returned them. Another possible explanation: and He hearkened to their voice, and so it is written above (v. 20): “and the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people.”

Moreover, as long as their sustenance will be provided, they will be able to perform and occupy themselves with the Law of the Lord, because the Law was given only to those who ate manna, and secondly, to those who eat the heave-offering (<i>Mechilta, Beshallach</i> 17, <i>Tanh.

Since he was puzzled, he questioned them concerning the stacks, “What is the reason for this?”
@10

<b>“From the beginning of bringing the heave-offering</b> We have surely eaten, and not an incidental meal but we ate, were satisfied, and left over. Now what you are surprised about, that we ate four months, and nevertheless, their stacks are so large - this is because the Lord blessed His people and gave them abundant grains; therefore, they increased our heave-offerings and tithes.

The Chronicler says “to every male” here to teach something remarkable, i.e., they would provide even to the young male children, as above (verse 16): “of the males from three years old and over,” and they would surely provide for their wives, sons and daughters.

This is related to the verse that states: “and Hezekiah prospered in all his work,” and after all this good, which the Holy One, blessed be He, had bestowed on him, God forsook him to test him, to know what was in his heart through the emissaries of the officers of Babylon, who were sent to him.

<b>“In Jerusalem, My name shall be forever”</b> Scripture decries Manasseh, who built altars to pagan deities in the very House concerning which the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “I wish My name to rest there.” The verse stated after this (verse 7) is also an expression of decrying: “And he placed the graven image of the idol that he made in the House of God, concerning which, etc.” And also the verse (8): “And I will not continue to remove Israel’s feet, etc.”

<b>Place the Holy Ark</b> According to its simple meaning, [they were to return it to its place] because Manasseh and Amon had removed the Holy Ark and placed their graven images in its place, as is proven above (33:7) concerning Manasseh: “And he placed the graven image of the idol, etc.” Therefore, Josiah commanded to return it and to place the Ark in the place that Solomon had built for it, but our Rabbis said (<i>Yoma</i> 42b) that he commanded the Levites to hide it there.
<b>you have no burden on the shoulders</b> This is another argument and the beginning of a statement. He said to them. You have no more toil of carrying a burden on your shoulders, i.e., all the vessels of the House of the Lord. You can no longer say, “Because of the toil of the burdens on our shoulders, we cannot serve the Lord and His people.” Therefore, from now on, serve the Lord your God with song and His people Israel by slaughtering and flaying their Passover sacrifices, as is proven below (verse 6): “And slaughter the Passover sacrifice and prepare yourselves, etc.”

<b>And such a Passover sacrifice had not been made</b> In II Kings (23:22) it is written: “For such a Passover sacrifice had not been performed since the time of the judges,” since the day that Israel was divided into two kingdoms, when the ten tribes separated from the kings of Judah and crowned a king over themselves. For all the time that they were two nations, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin made a Passover sacrifice for the sake of the Lord in Jerusalem, and these [made one] for the sake of pagan deities in Beth-El and in Dan. And this did not occur all the days of the judges, until Israel was divided into two families, and every generation had only one judge, and that judge would compel them to walk in the way of the Lord, as is explained in Judges (2:18): “and the Lord was with the judge and saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge.” And all the ten tribes would go to Shiloh and make a Passover sacrifice for the sake of the Lord. But such a Passover sacrifice had not been made all the days of the kings of Israel and Judah, that they should make a Passover sacrifice together. But in the days of Josiah, when the kingdom of the ten tribes had already ceased to exist, for since Jeremiah had returned the ten tribes, they did not crown another king, but Josiah reigned over them, and they all made a Passover sacrifice together in Jerusalem. This is the meaning of: “such a Passover sacrifice had not been performed...to the Lord in Jerusalem.” This interpretation, however, misleads me very much, and does not appear correct to me, for although Jeremiah had returned the ten tribes and Josiah reigned over them in Jerusalem, how is it possible that they did not make such a Passover sacrifice all the days of the judges and in the days of Samuel the Seer and in the days of David and Solomon, when Israel was dwelling in its land in peace and tranquility, and they had only one king, and their hearts were directed toward Heaven? Rather, this is the explanation, and this is the way Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Meshullam interpreted it to me: “And such a Passover sacrifice had not been made” ever, [it had never happened] that the king and the officers should supply enough animals for the Passover sacrifices and cattle for the festive peace offerings, and that he commanded the Levites to prepare for them and send each person according to how much he could eat.
@20
<b>After all this, that Josiah had prepared the Temple, Neco, the king of Egypt, went up</b> Scripture decries and laments Josiah, for a miracle was not performed for him as it had been for Hezekiah, about whom it is written (32:1): “After these deeds of integrity, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came” upon Hezekiah, and a miracle was performed for him.
<b>went up to wage war in Carchemish on the Euphrates</b> against the king of Assyria. So it is written in (II) Kings (23:29), and he wished to pass to him through the land of Israel, and Pharaoh Neco could not go to him by the way of the Euphrates River unless he were to pass through Israel, for Egypt is south of the land of Israel, and the Euphrates River is north of the land of Israel.
<b>went forth toward him</b> for he interpreted (Lev. 26:6): “and a sword will not pass through your land” to mean that even peaceful armies passing through the land [to attack other countries] should not pass through your land, but he was unaware of “the sin of the scorners of the generation, who arose to set up [idolatrous symbols] behind the door,” [i.e., he did not know that his generation found but little favor in God’s eyes], as is explained in Tractate <i>Taanith</i> (22b)
@22
<b>and he did not hearken to the words of Neco from the mouth of God</b> who said to him from the mouth of God, for so said Isaiah, (19:2): “And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians.” This is what the Kallir composed: “He withheld his troops from marching to Aram Naharaim, in order that no single sword should pass through Ephraim; and he did not hearken to the prophet to turn back, for it was decreed that Egyptian be set against Egyptian.”
@24
<b>into his second chariot</b> for it was customary for the king to ride on two chariots; he rode mainly on the first, but if necessary, he would ride on the second. The first one went before them, and when he was stricken, they put him into the second chariot.
@25
<b>And all the male...singers</b> - הַשָּׁרִים, an expression of song, choristers, for both song and lamentation are recited with the same voice. Concerning him, Amos prophesied (8:9): “and I will cause the sun to set at midday, and I will darken the land on a sunny day.” This is the day of Josiah, who died at the age of thirty-nine, in the middle of his days, for it is written (Ps. 90:10): “The days of our years because of them are seventy years,” and it is written (Amos 8:10): “And I will turn your festivals into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation, etc. and I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and its end like a bitter day.” This is what [the Chronicler] says: “And all the male and female singers said in their lamentations,” “and all of Judah and Jerusalem were mourning” for him.
<b>and they made them a statute</b> When any grief or weeping befalls them, for which they lament and weep, they mention this grief with it. An example is the Ninth of Av, in which we recite lamentations for those slain in the persecutions that occurred in our times. They will similarly bewail the day of Josiah’s death. An example is (Jud. 11:39f.): “and it became a statute in Israel, etc. to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, four days in a year.”
<b>and behold, they are written in the lamentations</b> in the Book of Lamentations.

@4
<b>and he changed his name to Jehoiakim</b> It is the custom of kings and princes to bestow a by-name upon their servants as they wish. An example is (Gen. 41:45): “And Pharaoh named Joseph, etc.,” and so (Num. 13:16): “and Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua,” and so, (Dan. 1:7): “Now the chief officer gave them names, etc.” All this is to make known that he rules over him to name him as he desires.
<b>and he changed his name to Jehoiakim</b> Why did he change his name to Jehoiakim? It is explained above that after Pharaoh slew Josiah, he appointed a king and fined them by imposing a tribute of enslavement upon them.
@6
<b>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon advanced upon him</b> because Pharaoh could not go forth from his land, as it is written (II Kings 24:7): “And the king of Egypt no longer went out of his land, for the king of Babylonia had taken from the river of Egypt until the Euphrates River, all that belonged to the king of Egypt,” for he defeated him in the fourth year in Carchemish on the Euphrates River, as is delineated in Jeremiah (46:2).
<b>to bring him to Babylon</b> He did not actually bring him, however, but he died on the way, and they cast away his corpse, and so did Jeremiah prophesy (22:19): “A donkey’s burial shall he be buried, dragged and tossed past the gates of Jerusalem.” Now where is a donkey’s burial? In a dog’s stomach, and so it is apparent in II Kings (24:6): “And Jehoiakim slept with his forefathers,” but it is not written: “and they buried him.”
@7
<b>And some of the vessels of the House of the Lord</b> And some of the vessels of the House of the Lord, and concerning this, Jeremiah prophesied (27:21): “For so said the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels remaining, etc.” Seder Olam questions (Dan. 1:1): “In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, etc. and the Lord delivered...into his hand.” Here, however, it is apparent that it was in the eleventh year of his reign. Now what is the meaning of “in the third year”? Counting from his rebellion, for it is stated (II Kings 24:1): “and Jehoiakim was his vassal for three years, then he turned and rebelled against him” for three years, and in the third year of his rebellion, he advanced against him, and that is the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar, for the master taught: In the first year [of his reign] he conquered Nineveh; in the second year he vanquished Jehoiakim, who served him for three years and rebelled against him for three years, and he did not reign until the fourth year of Jehoiakim, for it is stated (Jer. 25:1): “in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah - that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar.”

<b>and he made Zedekiah his brother king</b> Jehoiakim’s brother, and so in II Kings (24:17), “And the king of Babylonia crowned Mattaniah his uncle in his stead and changed his name to Zedekiah,” Jehoiachin’s uncle.
@12
<b>And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord</b> What is the evil? That he did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, [who spoke] from the mouth of the Lord, as is explained in Jeremiah (38:17ff.): “And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, ‘So said the Lord God of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you go out, etc.’...’I fear the Jews, etc.’” But aside from this sin, he did not sin except insofar as he did not obey the words of the prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord, and that he transgressed Nebuchadnezzar’s oath. But he did not do “his abominations and that which was found in” Jehoiakim, i.e., the evil done by Jehoiakim. [This was heard] from Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Meshullam.
@13
<b>who adjured him by God</b> as is explained in Ezekiel (17:12): “Say now to the rebellious house, etc.” The entire chapter was written regarding Jehoiachin and Zedekiah: (verse 13f.) “took its king and its princes, and brought them to him to Babylon,” refers to Jehoiachin and his company. “And he took of the royal seed and formed a covenant with him,” refers to Zedekiah.
@14
<b>Also, all etc.</b> They should have instructed Israel, as it is written (Deut. 24:8): “in accordance with all that the priests, the Levites, instruct you.” This does not refer to simple priests, who have no power to protest, but to the chiefs of the priests, who have the power to protest, but they did not protest.
<b>and they defiled the House of the Lord</b> with their abominations.

<b>And the Lord...sent upon them</b> All this is an acknowledgment of divine justice, so that you should not say that He did not forewarn them to repent of their evil ways, as it is written: “grasped forever His anger and kept His fury forever (Amos 1:12).” Therefore, it is stated: “And the Lord God of their forefathers sent upon them through His messengers,” and forewarned them to repent of their evil, and not once a year or a month, but every day, “sending them with every fresh morn.”

<b>and he had pity neither on youth nor virgin, elder nor ancient one</b> unlike the custom of soldiers, who, when they are victorious in war, slay the combatants, but pity the elders, the youths, and the virgins, and are filled with compassion for them, and Moses’ prophecy was fulfilled (Deut. 32:25): “The sword will bereave from outside and terror from within, youth, etc.”

The land of Israel rested for those seventy years. The Israelites provoked [God] in their land for 430 years. These included 390 years from the time they entered the land until the ten tribes were exiled therefrom, and they are explained (as follows): 243 years from the time Jeroboam ascended the throne until Hoshea the son of Elah was exiled, and 111 years during the administration of the judges, when they provoked [Him], and the rest are obscure. That is what is stated in Ezekiel (4:4ff.): “And you shall lie on your left side, and you shall place the iniquity of the house of Israel, etc., 390 days, etc. And when you complete these, you shall lie on your right a second time, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah, 40 days, a day for a year, a day for a year.” This teaches that the house of Judah sinned from the time that the ten tribes were exiled until Jerusalem was destroyed, for 40 years. How so? Twenty-two years of Manasseh, as it is written (II Kings 21:3): “according to all that Ahab did,” and Ahab reigned 22 years (and he [Manasseh] repented for thirty-three years, totaling fifty-five years.) Add 2 years of Amon, and 11 of Jehoiakim, totaling thirty-five years, and this prophecy was transmitted to Ezekiel in the 5th year of Zedekiah, totaling 40 years. The sum total of them all, of both Israel and Judah, is 430 years. Note that there are 64 Sabbatical and Jubilee years in 400 years. There are 5 Sabbatical years in 35 years, totaling 69, and the last Jubilee year was counted for them as iniquity, for because of their iniquity they were exiled therefrom. Hence the 70 hallowed years of Shemittah that Israel did not observe. They were consequently exiled for seventy years to fulfill what was said, (Lev. 26:34): “Then the land will be appeased regarding its Sabbaths.” So it is explained in Seder Olam (see ch. 26). Chronicles is concluded with this since he says: “until the completion of seventy years.” He had to state these verses and those of Ezra (in the beginning) to let us know that when those seventy years were over, “the wheel rotated” and they returned to their land. He therefore said here: “in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia” until “Who among you is of all His people, etc., and he may ascend.” The reason that the “vav” [and] of “And in the first year” is added, is because the Book of Daniel intervenes, for the book of Ezra continues in sequence after the Book of Daniel, and this “vav” connects them together.”
