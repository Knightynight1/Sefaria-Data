\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ The “bath,” which is a measure of oilthis is its tithe: the “bath” will be from a “kor.” I found [the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ following]: The tenth that the “bath” represents as a tithe shall be from a “kor.” How so? The tithe of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ a “bath” is from a “kor.” Dix measures in French, ten measures. This word is used for itself and for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ others, like (Num. 7:9): “the service of the Sanctuary,” (ibid. 4:33): “the service of [the families of] the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sons of Merari.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ ten baths\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  shall equal a “homer” for you. Then it will be possible to take from it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ one “bath” as a tithe. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ for ten baths are a homer\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  because the “homer” will consist of ten “baths” for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ you. So too did Jonathan render it: one out of ten is the “bath” in relation to the “kor” for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ten “baths” are a “kor”.
