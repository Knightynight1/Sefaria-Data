\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ from his land, as it is written (II Kings 24:7): "And the king of Egypt no longer went out of his land, for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the king of Babylonia had taken from the river of Egypt until the Euphrates River, all that belonged to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the king of Egypt," for he defeated him in the fourth year in Carchemish on the Euphrates River, as is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ delineated in Jeremiah (46:2). \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ to bring him to Babylon\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  He did not actually bring him, however, but 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he died on the way, and they cast away his corpse, and so did Jeremiah prophesy (22:19): “ A 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ donkey’s burial shall he be buried, dragged and tossed past the gates of Jerusalem.” Now where is a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ donkey’s burial? In a dog’s stomach, and so it is apparent in II Kings (24:6): “And Jehoiakim slept 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ with his forefathers,” but it is not written: “and they buried him.”
