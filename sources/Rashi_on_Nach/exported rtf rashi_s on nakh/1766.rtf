There is [reason] to wonder why these two 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ verses were written here, for Scripture continues to relate the events of Joash, and then repeats, “And

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [two verses] were written for the sole purpose of breaking continuity, so as not to juxtapose Elisha’s 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ demise with a verse dealing with idolatry, by saying, “And he did what was evil... And Elisha became
