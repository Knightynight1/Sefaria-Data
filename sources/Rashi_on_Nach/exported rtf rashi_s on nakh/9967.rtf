\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ These were the sons of Caleb. \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ áÌÆï çåÌø\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  is like \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ áÌÀðåÉ çåÌø\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , his son was Hur, and that Hur was the firstborn 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of Ephrath, his wife, not the firstborn of Caleb, and so it is explained above (verse 19): “And Caleb 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ took to himself Ephrath, and she bore him Hur.” Another explanation [is that] “for these were the sons 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of, etc.” Hur was Caleb’s son, and he begot a son whom he named Caleb, and this is its explanation: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ And these were the sons of Caleb the son of Hur: Shobal, etc. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ the firstborn of Ephrathah\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  but not the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ firstborn of Caleb. This refers to Hur. So it appears to us.
