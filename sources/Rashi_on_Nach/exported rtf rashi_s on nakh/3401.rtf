\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ childless.” and Zerubbabel was born to him in Babylon, and it was said to him through the prophet 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Haggai 2:23), “On that day...I will take you, Zerubbabel, and I will make you as a signet,” directed 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ toward what He said to his father, “Though...be a signet on My right arm,...I will remove him (sic).”
