\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ straightness of my heart, for I have straightened my heart to one heart when I willingly gave all these, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and from Your people, who gave willingly. The meaning is: With mine I am familiar and I know it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ well, but that of others I do not know, but I saw that they donated joyously, I say... \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and now, Your 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ people, who are present here, offer willingly to You\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  That is to say, I saw that they rejoiced in their 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ donation, but I do not know whether it was from the willingness of their heart, as it is written: (above 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ verse 9): “... and the people rejoiced over their donation.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ who are present\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  The ones found here are 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ those mentioned above (28:1): “And David assembled all the leaders of Israel, etc.,” but all the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ wealthy of Israel who were in all the cities were not found here. Therefore, Lord of the universe, the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ donation was diminished, for had all the remaining Israelites been there, then the donation would have 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ increased.
