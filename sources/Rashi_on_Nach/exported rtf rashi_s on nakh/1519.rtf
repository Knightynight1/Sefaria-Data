\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ here? Because on the day that the Shechinah was revealed to Jacob in Bethel and called him Israel, on 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that day He said to him, “A nation and a congregation of nations will be from you” (Gen. 35:11). Your 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ children are destined to congregate like other nations and build an altar to burn sacrifices on it during 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the time when the high places are proscribed. Nevertheless, I will consent to it (Gen. Rabbah 82:6).
