Priority:
add_commentary_links -- whichever is the commentary, just delete all add_commentary_links for text and regenerate
add_links_from_text -- these are the result of mistakes in text or algorithm and therefore should be deleted

add_commentary_links and add_links_from_text -- Check examples to see if there is also a valid link in the system corresponding to this case in which case we can delete the bad link.  Or, do we need to re-generate all links?

section links possibly not found in "section links to nowhere":
Rif, Ein Mishpat Cluster (601), add_links_from_text (568 just in Halakhah)



sections links to nowhere -- delete
link_disambiguator -- redisambiguate
Targum Jerusalem -- delete and re-generate
Rabbeinu Chananel and Rav Nissim Gaon -- delete and re-generate
