\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Similarly, the wicked man sees his friend being punished for his wickedness; yet he does not turn back.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Lord?” Sennacherib said (supra 36:20), “Who are they among all the Gods of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ lands...?” Nebuchadnezzar said, (supra 14:14) “I will liken myself to the Most High.” \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ like the
