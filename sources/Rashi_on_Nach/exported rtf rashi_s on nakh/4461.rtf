There were 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ three on the right of the gate and three on the left, as is stated in this section. The cells were near the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ eastern wall of the Womenís Court, on the outside, facing the Temple Mount. Now, from where do I 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ learn that they were on the outside? From what is written after this entire account (verse 17): ìAnd he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ brought me to the outer Court.î From here I learn that all that had been spoken of previously was 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ outside it, for he had not yet entered it. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And the cell was one rod in length, etc.\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  The inner area of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ each one was six cubits square. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and between the cells five cubits\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  The walls separating the cells were 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ five cubits thick, and so did Jonathan render: and between the cells was a wall of five cubits, and so 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ we learned in Tractate Middoth (4:7): The wall of the cell was five [cubits.] \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and the post of the gate 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ that was beside the hall of the gate, etc.\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  [i.e.,] [extending] beyond the gate was a hall connected to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the gate, as is delineated in this account, protruding ten cubits into the Womenís Court, and at its front 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ end were doors and posts, and this is what he meant by saying: ìand the post of the gateî which 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ was ìnext to the hall of the gate.î \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ from inside\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  [Heb. \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Ó≈‰«·Ã»Èƒ˙\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  i.e.,] toward the inside. The width of one 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ rod covered the thickness of the wall of the hall, one on the right, [wall] and one on the left, for the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ thickness of [each] wall of the hall - to the [hallwayís] right and to [its] left - was one rod, as he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ explains further.
