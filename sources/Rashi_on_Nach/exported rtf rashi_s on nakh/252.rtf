\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ coming to tell us (v.11) “And they did that which is evil,” it begins with the following: Before Joshua 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ died and they (Israel) accepted before him to serve God, he sent them each to his inheritance, and they 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ served God all his (Joshua’s) days and the days of the elders, etc., and afterwards, “And the children 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of Israel did evil, etc.”
