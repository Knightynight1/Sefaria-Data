\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ would establish Your faithfulness in the heavens, to be established and made permanent. Now what is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the faithfulness? That promise You promised David through Nathan the prophet, saying, “I formed a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ covenant with My chosen one to establish his seed until eternity.”
