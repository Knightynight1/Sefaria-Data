\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ by His congregation and His people, the congregation of Israel. Rabbi Akiva said: The world was 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ never as worthy as on the day that the Song of Songs was given to Israel, for all the Writings are holy, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ whereas the Song of Songs is the holiest of the holy. Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah said: To what can this 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ be compared? To a king who took a seah of wheat and gave it to a baker. He said to him, Extract for

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for one white loaf, sifted and superior. So are all the Writings holy and the Song of Songs the holiest 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of the holy, for it is all comprised of fear of Heaven and the acceptance of the yoke of His kingdom.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ a head and locks, for it is usual for dew and rain to stick to the hair and locks. Both dew and drops 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of the night may also be explained favorably, viz. the reward for precepts that are easy to perform,

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which are for appeasement and for atonement and for a pleasant fragrance: the law of the sin offering, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the guilt offering, the meal offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ [14] His hands\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Tablets, which He gave with His right hand, which are the work of His hands. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ wheels of gold\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  These 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ are the commandments, about which it is said (Ps. 19:11): They are to be desired more than gold, yea

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which are set in the middle of the body. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ [as] a block of ivory, overlaid with sapphires\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  It appears as

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Him from top to bottom. They commence, so to speak, from His head is as finest gold, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ progressively descend to His legs are as pillars of marble, since they come to appease Him, to draw 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ down His Shechinah from the heavenly abodes to the earthly abodes. He, however, counts their

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ a bridegroom enters the nuptial canopy, his heart longing for the nuptials and for the love of his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ marriage. When he comes to cohabit with her, she says to him, I have perceived a drop of blood like 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [the size of] a mustard seed. He turns his face the other way. Now no snake bit him, nor did a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ scorpion sting him. [Similarly,] one passes by on the road and sees freshly ripened fruit at the top of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the fig trees. He stretches out his hand to take [them]. They tell him, These belong to owners, and he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ too withdraws his hand because of [the prohibition] of theft. This is the meaning of she is fenced in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ with roses.

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ could collect from them: head taxes, tithes, and illegal foreclosures; they collected everything from
