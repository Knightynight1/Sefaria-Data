\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ has left me because of my blackness, for I am black because of the sunís gaze, but I am comely with 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the shape of beautiful limbs, and if I am black as the tents of Kedar, which are blackened by the rain, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for they are constantly spread out in the deserts, I am easily cleansed to be like the curtains of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Solomon. The allegory is that the congregation of Israel says to the nations: I am black in my deeds, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ but I am comely in the deeds of my ancestors, and even some of my deeds are comely. If I am guilty 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ of the iniquity of the [Golden] Calf, I can counter it with the merit of the acceptance of the Torah 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (Song Rabbah). He calls the nations the daughters of Jerusalem because she [Jerusalem] is destined to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ become the metropolis for them all, as Ezekiel prophesied (16:61): ìand I shall give them to you for 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ daughters,î like (Josh. 15:45): ìEkron, with her towns \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ÂÃ·¿Â…‰∆È‰»)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ .î
