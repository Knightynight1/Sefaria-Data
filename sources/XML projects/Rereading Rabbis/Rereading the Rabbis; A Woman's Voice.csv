Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice.1,Abbreviations and Acronyms
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Acknowledgments.1","I am deeply thankful to have had the opportunity to write this book while living in Jerusalem for a year. Spending time in Israel was spiritually satisfying and intellectually stimulating. Unfortunately, many catastrophic events took place during that year, including the assassination of a peace-seeking prime minister and a series of bus bombings that killed innocent people. As far away as the ultimate resolution of the conflict seems, I would like to believe that day by day, however imperceptibly, it grows closer."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Acknowledgments.2","Many people generously gave of their time to read and critique this manuscript. The following brief statements hardly reflect the intensity of my gratitude to them. Robert Brody, associate professor of Talmud at the Hebrew University, read and commented on the entire manuscript; Rabbi Shmuel Sandberg, formerly a professor of English at the City University of New York, did the same, while also paying attention to felicitous expression; Susan E. Shapiro, assistant professor of Jewish Thought and Philosophy of Religion at Columbia University, read the greater part of the manuscript, discussed it with me at length, and made many important suggestions for its improvement; Noam Gavriely, a physician and head of the Pulmonary Physiology Unit at Rambam Hospital/Technion, read much of the manuscript and commented on it from a medical and humanist perspective; Lippman Bodoff, an attorney, brought to a number of chapters his legal sensibility and training; Shaye J. D. Cohen, professor of Judaic Studies at Brown University, made many helpful comments on the chapter on <i>Niddah</i>; Shamma Friedman, distinguished service professor of Talmud at the Bet Midrash in Jerusalem and the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, and Athalya Brenner, professor of Bible at the University of Amsterdam, spent time discussing various issues with me."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Acknowledgments.3","The manuscript also benefited from the editorial advice of Ellen Frankel of the Jewish Publication Society, from extensive editorial attention by Beth Berkowitz, and from the research assistance of Naomi Lubarr, Avigayl Young, and Orit Kent."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Acknowledgments.4","I am also indebted to Marian Safran at Westview Press for her excellent comments. She brought this entire manuscript to a higher level of clarity, consistency, and pleasing expression. I wish to thank Fern Zekbakh for the fine indices."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Acknowledgments.5",I would also like to thank the Stroock Foundation for its fellowship assistance.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Acknowledgments.6","My husband, Milton Adesnik, and my three teenage sons, Ariel, Moshe, and Hillel, not only supported my project in general, but also expressed interest in every detail, often debating subtle points of Talmudic logic with me and stopping me from drawing unwarranted, although highly appealing, conclusions."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Acknowledgments.7","While in Israel, I spent Sunday nights teaching a women’s Talmud class and discussing different parts of the manuscript with the class. Their collective insight has woven itself into much of the textual analysis. I thank all of these women."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Acknowledgments.8","I am dedicating this book to Judy Hurwich, of blessed memory, a legendary Jerusalemite, in whose home, or more accurately, salon, these Talmud sessions took place. It was she who initiated the study group and energetically and enthusiastically kept it going. Her death on the road in August 1996 saddened us all. Like the rabbis of the Talmud who appear in this book, she tirelessly sought and even fought to improve women’s status in ritual and law. Also like them, she was torn between her loyalty to the texts and practices of the past and her unwavering commitment to the ethical stances of the present. May we be inspired by her life."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Acknowledgments.9","The practice of Judaism in the United States today, and also around the world, differs greatly from what it was as little as twenty years ago. Much of this change was spurred on by the emergence in the early 1970s of a feminist critique of Judaism. Whereas at that time female rabbis, cantors, and Talmud teachers and students were unheard of or scarce, today they abound. As more and more talented individuals—men and women alike—devote themselves to the spread of Jewish ideas and practice, they contribute to the continuing appeal and viability of the Jewish heritage. This book attempts to present the Talmudic basis for welcoming women into the full-fledged membership ranks of the Jewish people."

"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.1","L<small>IKE THE</small> B<small>IBLE, THE</small> T<small>ALMUD IS A</small> compendium of Jewish law, ethics, and culture. Even more than the Bible, the Talmud shapes the contours of Jewish life today. In a formal sense, it is an expansion of the legal portions of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible. In an informal sense, it is a wide-ranging series of inquiries into how a Jew should live his or her life. For hundreds of years Jews have devoted long hours to studying the Talmud. Its terse but dense style, mixture of Aramaic and Hebrew, intricate logical arguments, and hard-to-unravel textual history have given it a mystique of its own."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.2","Until recently, it was almost exclusively men who pored over the Talmud and wrote commentaries on it. Women neither studied it nor played any role in interpreting it. This difference is not surprising: Judaism, like most ancient religions, placed key religious tasks in the hands of men only. Today, with women’s growing interest in their past and desire to use the past to reshape the present, these texts need to be looked at afresh."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.3","This book will read Talmudic texts from a woman’s perspective. Therefore, the choice of texts and the questions asked of them derive from a wish to determine how the Talmud sees and treats women. The core of each chapter is composed of the texts themselves, which I will cite in translation and interpret according to standard techniques of Talmudic analysis. Unlike other books that present texts shorn of context, this book will locate and then read the key texts in a sustained fashion, in their own context, and in a rich context of closely associated materials. The point of doing so is to arrive at as accurate an interpretation as possible, not reading meaning into the text, but eliciting meaning from it."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.4",Let me begin with an illustration drawn from the aggadic (nonlegal) material in the Talmud.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.5","On one level, this anecdote shows, like the many others with which it is grouped in context, that the claims of scoffers can be rather easily refuted; that no matter what their argument, it can be rebutted. But on another level, this story is about women and rabbinic attitudes toward them. Had a man, let’s say a son of Rabban Gamliel, responded to the apostate, the sense of the story, in addition to repudiating the claim, would be that the rabbinic view of women is that they were created to serve men. However, since it is a woman who makes this point about women, we must think further."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.6","The question is, how are we to read the parable posed by the daughter of Rabban Gamliel? Is she saying that women’s role in life is to be subservient? Or is she saying that women are beings of independent value and substance, and that it is only for the sake of her didactic analogy that she first downgrades them, which gives her the opportunity to upgrade further the value of God’s replacement object? For of what benefit to Adam would be the gift of a woman in place of a rib unless the woman were there to serve him?<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">In the two parallel versions of this story, in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 17 (Theodor and Albeck ed., 158) and <i>Aboth de Rabbi Nathan B</i>, chap. 8 (Schechter ed., 23), no mention is made of woman as a handmaiden to serve man. The main point is that a woman is gold in comparison to a man’s rib, which is clay <i>(Aboth de Rabbi Nathan)</i> or that a woman is a pound of silver in comparison to a man’s rib, which is an ounce of silver <i>(Bereshit Rabbah)</i>. In these two stories it is a <i>matrona</i>, a Roman woman, who claims that God is a thief. A rabbi (R. Yossi or R. Joshua) answers her. See previous notes and Tal Ilan’s comments on the <i>matrona</i> in <i>Jewish Women in Greco-Roman Palestine: An Inquiry into Image and Status</i> (Tübingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 1995).</i> Note that her metaphor arouses no objection from the men present."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.7","The irony here is that the daughter of Rabban Gamliel<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Since most of the women who appear in Talmudic anecdotes are close relatives of rabbis, they are identified as the daughter of Rabbi X, the sister of Rabbi X, the wife of Rabbi X, and sometimes even the mother of Rabbi X. Only on rare occasions are they identified by their own name.</i> is not a selfeffacing maidservant but a self-confident, intelligent, and aristocratic woman. What she is and what she stands for are diametrically opposed to what she says women are meant to be. It is even possible that she has in mind the now-famous contradiction about the nature of woman found in the first two chapters of Genesis: In chapter 1, woman is portrayed as equal to man; in chapter 2, she is created from his rib, as secondary."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.8","It seems to me that the rabbis who told this story, who reported her words, were ambivalent in their attitudes toward women, viewing them on the one hand as lowly creatures, to be controlled, cared for, and used for men’s own purposes and pleasure, and on the other as essentially as human as men, not physically and mentally immature like children and not chattel like slaves.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. Daniel Boyarin, <i>Carnal Israel: Reading Sex in Talmudic Culture</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), 108: “This ironic double stance of both genuine empathy for women and rigid hierarchical domination is endemic in the Talmudic discourse.”</i> This point is supported by the fact that the parallel versions of the story place the provocative question in a woman’s mouth and the clever answer in a man’s.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">See note 3.</i> By reversing these roles, the Babylonian Talmud displays its attitude toward women: smart but subordinate."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.9","What I have just demonstrated is how to read a text from a woman’s perspective. The salient feature of this approach is looking below the surface message, in this case theological, in order to dig out information about how men and women viewed each other and themselves and the nature of their relationship during the Talmudic period. When texts that have been looked at by so many for so long are examined from new angles, it should not surprise us that they yield new information."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.10","We can easily deduce that Talmudic law and the biblical law upon which it is based mandate a patriarchal social order. The following representative examples will suffice to prove the point: Men may have more than one wife, but women may have only one husband; men take women in marriage and may divorce them at will, but women neither take men in marriage nor may they dismiss them; women inherit from neither a father nor a husband, but men inherit from both a mother and a wife (as well as from a father); women’s religious vows may be canceled by either a husband or a father, but men’s vows may not be canceled by either a wife or a mother. The male bias of these rules is evident."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.11","It is all too easy, as sensitive human beings, to grow angry each time we come across yet another example of a blatantly patriarchal law. But that, to my mind, is not the only or even the most reasonable response. It is entirely predictable that when judging rabbinic law from the perspective of our own recently developed egalitarian stance, we will find the treatment of women unacceptable and even morally offensive. Today, we can no longer justify assigning second-class status and fewer rights to an entire category of human beings for no reason other than their gender."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.12","Were the Talmud simply an arcane body of ancient texts, we would not find ourselves troubled upon reaching such a conclusion. But there is much more at stake here: The rabbis’ literary and legal legacy rests at the foundation of Judaism as it is practiced today. We therefore have a problem: How can we continue to adhere to Jewish observance today in the face of a conflict between it and our modern sense of social justice?"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.13","One solution is simply to recognize that the rabbis were products of their times. Since the ancient world (and even much of the modern world until recently) subscribed to a patriarchal worldview, they did too. Although such a relativist perspective in no way diminishes the religious authority of the rabbis, neither does that perspective properly recognize their real accomplishments, even in their own time and place."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.14","I am, therefore, suggesting that we devise a different standard by which to evaluate what the rabbis achieved. One possibility is to investigate how the rabbis’ legal thinking compares to that of their Greco-Roman counterparts. Since the rabbis were familiar with the Roman law of their day and incorporated some of its principles and even specific institutions into their own legislation, such as a gift in contemplation of death, how does the rabbis’ treatment of women compare to that of the Roman legislators?<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">The gift in contemplation of death is treated in Chapter 8. On the subject of rabbinic knowledge of Hellenistic law, see Saul Lieberman, “How Much Greek in Jewish Palestine,” in <i>Texts and Studies</i> (New York: Ktav, 1974), 216–234, in particular, 225–228. For an analysis of broader cultural influences, see Lieberman, <i>Greek and Hellenism in Jewish Palestine</i> (Jerusalem: Bialik, 1962).</i> As interesting as it would be to draw these kinds of comparisons, and I will do so from time to time, this is not the best question to ask. A religious legal system, much more than a secular one, is bound by a commitment to maintain continuity with the practices of the past and accept the authority of the texts of the past. It ascribes a divine origin to these practices and texts."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.15","I therefore propose that we evaluate the rabbinic system from a dynamic rather than a static perspective. Since the rabbis make it clear that the Torah undergirds their legislation, the questions that merit investigation are the following: In comparison to the Torah, which the rabbis accepted as holy, God-given, and hence immutable, how does their own legislation treat women? Without violating the letter of the law, were they seeking to accord them more rights and a higher status than that accorded them by the Torah? Or were they introducing new stringencies that would make women’s lives more difficult? In general, in what direction was their legislation concerning women headed? Furthermore, do the legislators openly reveal their own sense that women are discriminated against in key areas of Jewish law? Is there any evidence that they are uncomfortable with their patriarchal privilege? Do they allow women, whose voices they occasionally include in the text, to express dissatisfaction, even opposition, to the way things were?"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.16","My answer, stated succinctly, is that the rabbis upheld patriarchy as the preordained mode of social organization, as dictated by the Torah. They thus perpetuated women’s second-class, subordinate status. They neither achieved equality for women nor even sought it. But of critical importance, they began to introduce numerous, significant, and occasionally bold corrective measures to ameliorate the lot of women. In some cases, they eliminated abusive behaviors that had developed over time. In others, they broke new ground, granting women benefits that they never had before, even at men’s expense. From their own perspective, the rabbis were seeking to close the gap that had developed over time between more enlightened social thinking and women’s more subordinate status as defined by the received texts, biblical and rabbinic, without openly opposing such texts. In almost every key area of law affecting women, the rabbis introduced significant changes for the better. We cannot be sure that the rabbis themselves conceived of the notion or initiated the trend of improving women’s lives—such ideas could have come from the surrounding culture or from previous generations—but we can find clear evidence that the rabbis endorsed this position of their own free will.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Judith Plaskow, <i>Standing Again at Sinai</i> (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1990), who recognizes that the rabbis were disturbed by women’s implied absence from Sinai and therefore “read women’s presence into the text” (27). But she goes on to say that they do this “despite the fact that in their own work they continually reenact that absence.” I understand the rabbinic texts somewhat differently.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.17","This conclusion should not surprise us. Law tends to develop over time in the direction of more humane treatment of the underprivileged. In the past several centuries, the move in many parts of the world from hierarchy to democracy is paralleled in the ancient rabbinic world by a move toward a modified, benevolent patriarchy and even a modified hierarchy. And this expansion of “rights” for women applied, albeit on a lesser scale, to other groups, such as non-Jewish slaves. Thus, the rabbis’ growing sympathy for women is not out of line with broad legal developments in other areas of Jewish law."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.18","But did the rabbis go far enough? Could we have expected more from them? I tend to think they accomplished what they could. Although they reacted with leniency to the excessive stringencies of the Dead Sea sects that preceded them, for instance in the realm of ritual purity, and though they did not embrace the rampant misogynism of Philo, the first-century Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, neither did they adopt some of the more advanced provisions of Roman law. They cannot, therefore, be called feminists. More accurately, we can regard them as helpful to women."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.19","I am troubled by the contemporary assumption that the presence of patriarchy necessarily precludes the possibility of those within it acting on women’s behalf. When scholars find evidence of proto-feminist action, they consider it an aberration, the expression of a dissident voice. I am not so sure. It is also possible to conclude that absolute patriarchy is only a theoretical projection, a construct, not a reality. Careful examination of rabbinic texts has led me to believe that rabbinic sympathy for women is not an expression of dissidence but rather reflects a more nuanced patriarchy than is generally assumed. Recent research in the Bible<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Athalya Brenner, ed., <i>A Feminist Companion to Wisdom Literature</i> (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1995). Brenner’s comments (in “Some Observations on the Figurations of Woman in Wisdom Literature,” 85–97) on the unnamed queen who shames her husband and is the only intelligent and calm person around, as well as Valler’s comments (in “Who Is <i>Eshet Hayil</i> in Rabbinic Literature?” 65) on the rabbinic concept of “a woman of valor” reveal that the women of the Bible and Talmud are not the docile, submissive helpmates that patriarchy implies and that a patriarchal text would be expected to portray.</i> and my own evaluation of the Talmud suggest that rabbinic society is more accurately characterized as a “benevolent patriarchy.” Even though it placed men in charge of women, it also permitted men to make changes that benefited women and that showed concern for women in general and even respect for individual women of accomplishment (as measured in male terms)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.20","A number of books have already appeared that deal with women in rabbinic texts. They fall into two broad categories: those that analyze what these legal texts have to say about men, women, society, and culture; and those that try to reconstruct women’s history in the Talmudic period, based on passages found in the rabbinic corpus and elsewhere. I will briefly mention some of the more important ones. Jacob Neusner and Judith Wegner, in their systematic, detailed studies of the Mishnah, find extensive evidence of women’s second-class status. According to both authors, the rabbis view women as morally lax temptresses from whom men must protect themselves.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">Jacob Neusner was the first to engage in a systematic reading of rabbinic texts from a feminist perspective. He develops a theory in a wide variety of publications, and in particular in <i>Method and Meaning in Ancient Judaism</i>, Brown Judaica Series, no. 10 (Missoula, Mont.: Scholars Press, 1979), 79–100, about how the rabbis defined the essential nature and character of women and men. Because of women’s unruly sexual potential, lying just below the surface, it has been necessary for men to exercise control over women. Surveying all the volumes of Mishnah that treat women, he shows that the rabbis are especially interested in the moments when women are transferred from one man to another because those times pose the greatest dangers.<br>Judith Wegner, in <i>Chattel or Person? The Status of Women in the Mishnah</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), examines, from the perspective of today’s jurisprudential standards, the vast body of mishnaic law dealing with women. She finds that in some areas, such as those relating to a woman’s sexuality and reproductive capacity, the woman is treated as chattel; in all others, she is treated as person.</i> Daniel Boyarin and Shulamit Valler, in their close readings of legal and aggadic materials, identify multiple rabbinic outlooks on women, ranging from the more indifferent to the more empathetic.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">Boyarin, in <i>Carnal Israel</i>, identifies two phenomena relevant to the focus of this book: the rabbis’ empathetic thinking about women, and the existence of women on the margins who engaged in actions that the culture highly valued, such as the study of Torah. He concludes that although such empathetic thinking did not overturn the male-dominated hierarchy, the texts in which men oppose the dominant ideology imply the participation of a dissident, proto-feminist voice.<br>Shulamit Valler, in <i>Women and Womanhood in the Stories of the Babylonian Talmud</i> (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1993), analyzes in detail five clusters of halakhic anecdotes relating to women. She finds that the rabbis abandoned the stringencies that they themselves had developed and decided cases that came before them in a more lenient manner, one that displayed sensitivity toward women.</i> Tal Ilan, in her historical work on women’s status in the early rabbinic period, notes the vast differences between rabbinic pronouncements and real women’s lives.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">Tal Ilan, in <i>Jewish Women in Greco-Roman Palestine: An Inquiry into Image and Status</i>, a historical work, asks what was the exact social status of women in the period beginning 332 <small>B.C.E.</small>, the time of Alexander’s conquest of Palestine, and ending 200 <small>C.E.</small>, close to the time of the Mishnah’s publication. She concludes that only a small segment of the Jewish population, in particular the upper classes, lived according to tannaitic prescriptions.</i> Miriam Peskowitz, upon reading rabbinic texts in the context of Greco-Roman legal and literary texts, gender theory, and material evidence, demonstrates that the tannaitic statements about women’s work constitute a theory of masculinity and femininity.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">Miriam Peskowitz, <i>Spinning Fantasies</i> (University of California Press, forthcoming). In “Engendering Jewish Religious History,” in <i>Judaism Since Gender</i>, Peskowitz puts forward the theory that the study of “women in rabbinic Judaism” or “women and rabbinic Judaism” is no longer appropriate because it implies that women are separate from and marginal to Judaism. In the same volume, Judith Baskin responds that there still is a need to conduct these kinds of studies. In exploring images of women, she claims, we find evidence of multivocality, of minority views that are sometimes more enlightened than those of the dominant view of women’s essential difference from and inferiority to man. We can thus learn “important things about how Jewish knowledges are engendered” (“Rabbinic Judaism and the Creation of Woman,” 125–130).</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.21","Those six books have all made significant contributions to our understanding of how the Talmud addresses the topic of women. Although this book will also read texts closely and arrive at some shared conclusions with the above authors, the question that drives this research is different, as is the methodology."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.22","What I am <i>not</i> trying to do in this book is to present the basics of Jewish law, from the Bible until today, as it affects women, as does Rachel Biale.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">Rachel Biale, <i>Women and Jewish Law: An Exploration of Women’s Issues in Halakhic Sources</i> (New York: Schocken, 1984).</i> Rather, I have selected for consideration those matters that best illustrate that the law, in general, was in the process of change. There are many issues that I do not deal with at all, such as levirate marriage, and others that I do not deal with in full, like testimony. I build my case by analyzing only ten topics in detail, although not exhaustively."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.23","What I am also <i>not</i> trying to do in this book is to write social history. Historians often find themselves using law to write history, and Talmudists, using history to understand law. Both of these approaches are faulty. Historians cannot assume that all or even most people followed the law. Similarly, Talmudists cannot assume that sociohistorical realities are accurately reflected in the law. As hard as it will be to restrain myself from seeing the law as a representation of social reality, I will try to do so. What I am interested in is a history of the law, not a history of people. Although it is likely that what jurists see around them dictates their choice of cases to deal with and focus on, we cannot know that for sure. Since all cases could be hypothetical constructs, we cannot deduce social realities from legal preoccupation with certain issues."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.24","The question is, how does one read an ancient text to arrive at the truth, at the author’s intended meaning? Plucking statements from different works, written in different time periods by different authors, weaving them together into a unified whole, and then claiming that they represent the rabbinic view on a particular topic is deceptive. Each text must be examined on its own; the interplay of voices over time and between texts should not be muted."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.25","To write a credible book on the subject of Talmud and women requires that we read the texts as objectively as possible, not arriving at interpretations dictated by preconceived conclusions. In order to avoid this pitfall, I have developed the following method for reading texts: First, for each topic under consideration, I go to the loci classici, the places in the Torah and the Talmud where that topic is discussed initially and/or fully and extract the main ideas. For the Torah, that usually involves several verses. For the Talmud, that can be an entire volume, a chapter, or just one passage. Note that by so doing I am not making any choices as to which material to examine but am merely analyzing the rabbis’ principal statements on a subject. I then compare the biblical and rabbinic statements in order to see if the rabbis have made any significant changes."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.26","Second, because I assume, as noted above, that literary and legal contexts influence meaning, I then read each paragraph of the relevant Mishnah, also called a <i>mishnah</i>, in the light of the surrounding cluster of <i>mishnah</i>s. Third, I read the mishnaic passages in the context of related rabbinic texts, from both the same time period and later. By thus seeing the full range of views on a subject, we can understand more accurately and precisely the meaning of each view articulated. Also, by noting the field of choices open to each rabbinic speaker, we can assess the relative stringency or leniency of the view he chose to adopt."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.27","To illustrate by way of example: The Mishnah sharply reduced the number of cases in which a rapist had to pay the biblically prescribed fine to a young victim’s father—he was obligated only if he raped her when she was between twelve and twelve and one-half years old. This ruling might lead us to conclude that the early rabbis make light of the crime of rape. But by means of a contextual reading, we learn that the Mishnah replaced the fixed fine <i>(kenas)</i> with a variable one <i>(pegam)</i>, to be paid in all cases without exception and able to exceed the fifty silver shekels stipulated by the Torah. From this fine we realize that the rabbis were taking rape <i>more</i> seriously rather than less. In this way, we see how a richer contextual reading yields a more nuanced interpretation."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.28",<b>The Rabbinic Texts</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.29","The key rabbinic text, the touchstone of all subsequent rabbinic commentary, is the Mishnah (M), the first canonical and reasonably comprehensive compilation of Jewish law to follow the Bible. It is written in Hebrew and arranged topically into six major divisions, called orders, which are each subdivided into tractates (volumes), named accordingly. One of the six divisions is called Nashim, meaning women or, more likely, married women.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">I prefer this translation because women are dealt with in virtually every volume of the Mishnah. Married women and a variety of marital institutions are dealt with primarily in the tractates of Nashim.</i> Most texts we will examine in this book derive from that order."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.30","Much of the material in the Mishnah is anonymous, but about one third to one half is attributed to specific individuals, called Tannaim. Although some material precedes the common era, such as that attributed to Hillel and Shammai, the vast majority dates from the first two centuries of the common era. It is easy to see that the Mishnah developed in layers over time, each generation of rabbis adding its thoughts to those of the previous ones. Rabbi Judah the Prince, usually referred to merely as Rebbe, is credited with the final redaction of the Mishnah in about the year 200. Whoever the redactor was, it is clear that an editorial hand imprinted the entire work with a consistency of style, syntax, and even legislative outlook.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">Jacob Neusner, ed., <i>The Study of Ancient Judaism</i>, pt. 1 (New York: Ktav, 1981), 18ff.</i> It is therefore legitimate to ask, with respect to most topics, what the broad legislative goals of the redactor of the Mishnah were."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.31","The Tosefta (T), also written in Hebrew and organized just like the Mishnah, with the same major divisions and subdivisions, is a companion volume to the Mishnah, dating from the same period of time and presenting the views of many of the same rabbis. It seems more a compilation and compendium than a thoroughly redacted work. It is intimately related to the Mishnah, even beyond its organization, in that paragraph by paragraph it supplements, disputes, and illustrates passages of the Mishnah. But what is the relationship of these two works to each other?"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.32","It is standard scholarly opinion that the Tosefta postdates the Mishnah and is a commentary on it, in fact, the very first commentary. But this statement does not give the complete picture. For although the Tosefta contains much material posterior to the Mishnah, it contains anterior material as well. Careful comparison of passages in the Mishnah and Tosefta shows that many mishnaic rules are based on and constitute a reworking, often very subtle, of the parallel Tosefta passage. It is likely that the redactor of the Mishnah changed the earlier formulation of the rule in order to have it conform to his view on a particular subject. By examining the roads not taken by him, by seeing which of the many options he selected and which he rejected, we can better understand his legislative approach and goals, as well as those of his contemporaries. Comparison of two similar but slightly different formulations of the same rule makes it possible, again, to see in what direction the law was headed and what were the legal concerns of the day. The striking fact that the views of the Tosefta are often more lenient, and hence beneficial to women, than those of the Mishnah, suggests that the redactor of the Mishnah had a more conservative bent than some of his colleagues.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">Judith Hauptman, “Pesiqah L’humra B’mishnat Gittin,” <i>Proceedings of the Tenth World Congress of Jewish Studies</i>, August 1990; “Women’s Voluntary Performance of Commandments from Which They Are Exempt” (in Hebrew), <i>Proceedings of the Eleventh World Congress of Jewish Studies</i>, Jerusalem, 1994; Shamma Friedman, “Tosefta Atikta … ” <i>Tarbiz</i> 62, no. 3 (5753/1992–93).</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.33","The Babylonian Talmud, known as the Bavli, is the great commentary on the Mishnah, produced in Babylonia from about 200 until 750 <small>C.E.</small>, and written in both Hebrew and Aramaic. In today’s printed texts of the Talmud, each passage from the Mishnah is followed by the associated Gemara, that is, the analysis of the <i>mishnah</i> drafted by the Tannaim and Amoraim, the latter being the collective name of rabbis of the post-mishnaic period. The earliest form of the Gemara on a given <i>mishnah</i> consisted of a string of tannaitic and amoraic statements, the tannaitic ones commenting directly on the <i>mishnah</i> and the amoraic ones both on the <i>mishnah</i> itself and on the related tannaitic comments. These tannaitic materials, called <i>baraitot</i>, external teachings—because they remained outside of the Mishnah—are often the same passages that appear in a parallel place in the Tosefta. They prove extremely useful when one is deciphering the meaning of cryptically worded <i>mishnah</i>s.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">It is especially common for the Amoraim of the two Talmuds to interpret a <i>mishnah</i> in the light of the parallel paragraph in the Tosefta. In so doing they often read back into the <i>mishnah</i> a line of thought that the redactor of the Mishnah had decided to reject. In this way the Amoraim are able to reclaim discarded points of view, ones that they may find more to their liking than that of the redactor of the Mishnah. See my book <i>Development of the Talmudic Sugya: Relationship Between Tannaitic and Amoraic Sources</i> (Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1988), chap. 3.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.34","Like the Mishnah, the Bavli developed in layers, each generation adding its thinking on the matters under discussion to that of the previous one. Unlike the Mishnah, it does not seem to have been redacted by one individual, although tradition claims that R. Ashi (d. 425 <small>C.E.</small>) was a principal redactor.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">See David Goodblatt, “The Babylonian Talmud,” in <i>The Study of Ancient Judaism</i>, pt. 2, ed. Jacob Neusner (New York: Ktav, 1981), 170–177.</i> The Bavli also contains an extensive layer of anonymous commentary, called <i>stama d’gemara</i>, the anonymous voice of the text. It does not express independent opinions of its own but rather weaves together the tannaitic and amoraic materials into a unified whole. There is general scholarly consensus that this commentary, without which it would be almost impossible to understand the interrelationship of the earlier materials, was composed between approximately 500 and 750 <small>C.E.</small> Because of its subsidiary nature, I will pay less attention to it and more to the tannaitic and amoraic dicta themselves. The Talmud also cites, with reasonable frequency, anecdotes and courtroom cases that relate to the law under discussion. Since no women functioned as Tannaim or Amoraim, it is in these materials, which often feature women, that we find what appear to be historically reliable data about women, what concerned them, how they articulated their ideas before the rabbinical judges, and how the judges responded to them. Whenever relevant, I will cite this material."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.35","The last major text under consideration is the Palestinian Talmud, known as the Yerushalmi, an analogue of the Bavli, written at approximately the same time, but in the land of Israel. It, too, is a commentary on the Mishnah, composed of tannaitic passages, amoraic sayings, and interwoven anonymous commentary. It was completed in the early part of the fifth century <small>C.E.</small>, much before the Bavli."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.36","Of these four texts, only two are studied with regularity today, the Mishnah and the Bavli. The other two, the Tosefta and the Yerushalmi, were not regarded by the codists as the basis for fixing Jewish law and have been routinely neglected, probably for that reason. For the purposes of this inquiry—and for the satisfaction of general intellectual curiosity—these works are extraordinarily useful."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.37",<b>The Plan of the Book</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.38","Throughout this book, I limit myself to consideration of halakhic texts and ignore aggadic (i.e., nonlegal and homiletical) ones because I am interested in the development of law—not attitudes—over time. Some of the aggadic statements praise women, and others exhibit deep misogyny. Since almost every aggadic statement can be offset by another that says just the opposite, all that we can conclude by collecting many examples of any one view is that it existed, not necessarily that it dominated. However, even if I fail to show that misogyny did not predominate, I still hope to show that it stayed in the realm of theory and was not incorporated into the law. This is a point worth emphasizing.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">Tikvah Frymer-Kensky, in her chapter on biblical women (in <i>Feminist Perspectives on Jewish Studies</i>, ed. Lynn Davidman and Shelly Tanenbaum [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994]), notes that “much of the patriarchy that we associate with the Bible and all of its misogyny has been introduced … by later generations of readers” (26). Although I find extensive evidence of a patriarchal social order in biblical laws, I agree with Frymer-Kensky that misogyny is not the driving force.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.39","Each chapter of this book strives to accomplish two goals: one, to tell the “story” of one aspect of Jewish law—how it changed over time—through close readings of texts; two, to dispel some well-established myths about what these texts mean. Chapters 1 and 2 of this book, “Sotah” (wayward wife) and “Relations Between the Sexes,” illustrate the contextual method of reading rabbinic texts and provide background material for the rest of the book. Both deal with the rabbis’ perception of men’s and women’s sexual nature and the implications of this outlook for social and religious life. The next five chapters, “Marriage” (3), “Rape and Seduction” (4), “Divorce” (5), “Procreation” (6), and “<i>Niddah</i>” (menstruants) (7), all deal with aspects of marital life. The reason that a discussion of sex crimes against women follows a discussion of marriage is that, according to the Bible, the simplest solution for the victim’s predicament was marriage to the aggressor. Chapter 8, “Inheritance,” follows, because a woman’s dowry upon marriage is the share she receives from her father’s estate. “Testimony” and “Ritual,” Chapters 9 and 10, deal with women interacting with men in a court of law and in the performance of religious ritual, at home or in the synagogue. Note that since each chapter tells its own “story,” each may be read independently of the others. Also note that each chapter is designed for all readers, Talmudic novices as well as veterans. Both groups will find material to ponder."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.40","Two populations may object to the conclusions reached in this book. First, some Jews will not grant that the rabbis made any changes in the law to improve women’s status because the law in its entirety was all there in the Torah to begin with. Since they posit the transcendent value of Torah and its non-time-bound system of ethics, then, even that which is not made explicit in the Torah is still embedded in the words and is waiting to be discerned by the reader at the appropriate time. This view is a matter of belief; I cannot dispute or disconfirm it."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.41","I see things somewhat differently. If the Torah is silent and the rabbis speak up—for instance, if the Torah describes marriage as the purchase of a young woman from her father, and the rabbis later portray it as a “social contract”—then I will credit them with adapting the older rules to the more progressive social thinking and altered social configurations of their day. I am not thereby casting aspersions on the Torah. Rather, I am suggesting that in some cases what was appropriate at an earlier time was no longer perceived of as ethical by later generations. There is ample precedent for such legislative evolution in the ancient world. For example, research on the Dead Sea Scrolls has shown that many of them rework biblical texts in order to accommodate these texts to the outlook of the scroll’s author. Scholars consider that an early form of exegesis. I am making the same claim for the Talmud. It, too, is a work of exegesis in that it bases itself on the Torah but, at the same time, alters those rules that do not sit well with its own contemporary sensibilities."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.42","The second population that may challenge my conclusions is the feminist one. In light of my reasonably positive evaluation of rabbinic behavior toward women, some feminists may label this reading thinly veiled apologetics. I would counter by arguing that my approach represents a “contextualized feminism.” It demonstrates that patriarchy was the dominant form of social organization in the rabbinic corpus and only identifies improvements in women’s legal status within such a framework. It also seeks to determine what role notions of gender play in men’s thinking on a variety of subjects affecting women and also their attitude toward women. In a broader sense, it is feminist in that I show, as does Ilana Pardes<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">Ilana Pardes, <i>Countertraditions in the Bible: A Feminist Approach</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), 4, 144–145. Pardes finds remnants of female voices in the biblical texts that speak out against patriarchy, that put forth truths other than the predominant patriarchal ones. Although suppressed, those remnants were nonetheless included in the canon.</i> and others for the Bible, that some of the rabbi-legislators themselves, and occasionally some women, put forth countervoices, calling into question the patriarchal basis of Jewish law.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">The redactor of the Talmud, by including these male voices, and occasional women’s voices that also speak out against rabbinic patriarchy, is himself expressing some doubts about the appropriateness of its male bias. For women’s voices, see, for example, BT Yevamot 34b and PT Ketubot 2:5; 26c. These texts are discussed in Chapter 6 and the Conclusion.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.43","It is unfortunate that so little feminist Bible research focuses on biblical <i>law</i>. Some researchers who study the biblical women, like Tikvah Frymer-Kensky, claim that the social status of women devolved over time, from the biblical to the Talmudic period, in particular in response to Hellenism and its misogynies.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">Frymer-Kensky, <i>Feminist Perspectives</i>, 26. The same point is made by S. D. Goitein, in “Women as Creators of Biblical Genres,” <i>Prooftexts</i> 8, no. 1 (January 1988): 29. Goitein, in this article, analyzes women’s poetry, not laws of personal status.</i> If such studies focused on biblical law, however, they would show that the <i>legal</i> status of women improved over time. Just as so many feminist studies are recovering the Bible for women, identifying the feminist countertraditions, reading the stories about major and also minor female characters through feminist eyes, and reaching the conclusion that the Bible speaks to feminist women and men today, I will, in a general way, do the same for Talmud. I do not believe that it is possible to depatriarchalize the Talmud, but I will show that, within its patriarchal framework, not only is sympathy expressed for women, as already noted by Valler and Boyarin, but, even more important, resolute action taken on their behalf.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">I disagree with Rosemary Ruether (“Feminist Interpretation: A Method of Correlation,” in <i>Feminist Interpretation of the Bible</i>, ed. Letty M. Russell [Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1985]), who claims that the Bible becomes the authoritative source for justification of patriarchy in Jewish and Christian society (116). Since Jews today read the Bible and practice its teachings through a rabbinic filter, it is more accurate to say that the Bible and Talmud justify, not patriarchy per se, but a modified, benevolent patriarchy, as explained above. Ruether’s interpretive, redemptive strategy is to focus on the prophetic traditions that destabilize the ideologies supporting the male-dominated social order.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.44","I will not try to fit my conclusions into the framework of any particular feminist theory. Nor will I dismiss the rabbinic corpus merely as the thinking of men about women, not women about women. I read and analyze these texts both from the perspective of a feminist consciousness and from the perspective of the Talmudist that I am trained to be. These qualifications, I hope, have predisposed me neither to put the rabbis on a pedestal nor to ignore their limitations. I place before the reader all the texts and my methods of analysis. The words will speak for themselves."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Introduction.45",<b>Notes</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.1","S<small>OTAH</small> (<small>WAYWARD WIFE</small>) <small>IS A TRACTATE</small> at war with itself. Based on a chapter of Bible, it describes in grim and sometimes lurid detail how a woman who is only suspected by her husband of infidelity may be subjected by him to the ordeal of the bitter waters. In between the laws, the redactors insert lengthy harangues against the woman in question, deriding her behavior in extreme terms and seeking to use her public humiliation to deter other women from promiscuous behavior. But the careful reader will find this tractate somewhat schizophrenic: At the same time that it regards the suspected adulteress with such contempt, it sets up legal procedures that virtually guarantee that the ordeal of the bitter waters will never be implemented, or if implemented, that its results will be ambiguous and hence useless. As prominent as are the numerous passages that lay out the details of the ritual, surrounding and throttling them are many others that place unrealistic restrictions on their implementation."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.2","How are we to understand this phenomenon? The rabbis’ aversion to capital punishment stems, apparently, from a reasonable fear of putting an innocent person to death. However, since the <i>sotah’s</i> punishment is determined by the waters, not the judges, and only the guilty will be punished, the rabbis had no reason to fear judicial error and its consequences. It therefore seems that at least part of what animated the rabbinic revolt against this ordeal was a desire to treat women fairly, to eliminate a practice that confounded their notions of justice and morality."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.3",<b>Biblical Basis for Sotah and Problems</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.4","Numbers 5:11–31 is one of the more perplexing sections of the Bible. It describes the case of a woman straying from the right path and engaging in sexual relations with a man other than her husband. If a fit of jealousy sweeps over a man and he suspects his wife of errant behavior, even though there are no witnesses to her act, he may take her to the Temple and make her undergo the ordeal of the bitter waters. As part of the ritual, she has to drink a potion made of water, earth from the Temple floor, and ink dissolved into the water from a parchment on which were written the curses of this very chapter. If she is innocent, the waters will not hurt her; if guilty, they will cause her serious physical harm."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.5","This chapter of Torah gives the reader pause for several reasons: First, the Torah is sanctioning trial by ordeal, albeit only here and only for this suspected transgression. Elsewhere, the Torah sets a protocol for justice: It is to be dispensed in the courtroom, by judges, and based on the testimony of witnesses. Here, since there are no witnesses, there is, theoretically, no basis for a trial. Nevertheless, the Torah requires the woman to undergo this trial by ordeal. We should recognize that the ordeal described here, where there must be divine intervention in order for the benign potion to do damage, is an improvement over others of the Ancient Near East, where the accused was thrown into a river and if innocent was assumed to be able to find his way out. Still, the Torah deviates from its own protocol to order for the <i>sotah</i> a trial by ordeal, not by judges."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.6","Second, a man suspected by his wife of exactly the same kind of behavior cannot be taken to the Temple and subjected to the ordeal of the bitter waters. This asymmetry points to the underlying extreme patriarchy: She is his property, intended for his exclusive use, and must therefore conform to the behavioral standards he sets for her; he is not her property and so she can make no demands of him."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.7","In a patriarchal society, a sexual act between a man and a woman is viewed as adulterous only if the woman is married to another man; if the man is married to another woman, that is of no consequence. Therefore, a married woman is allowed to have sex with her husband only, but a married man is permitted to have sex with his wife and other women as well, provided they are not married. His wife has no sexual monopoly on him. Thus a woman who commits adultery seems to be perceived as a greater disruption of the social order than a man who does the same. Society frowned upon her misconduct more than his because she betrayed not only God but also her husband, whereas a man’s extramarital sex is not considered a betrayal of his wife.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. <i>The JPS Torah Commentary, Deuteronomy</i>, 206–207. Tigay writes that in the Ancient Near East, adultery by a woman was viewed as an offense solely against the woman’s husband. In the Bible, it is viewed as a sin against God, as well as the husband, since God has forbidden adultery.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.8","Third, if the woman under suspicion was, in fact, unfaithful to her husband, she would be punished by the waters; but the man with whom she committed this act would go free. It does not seem right to us today that if the two of them committed exactly the same sin, together, that only one gets punished and the other does not."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.9","Not only do we today find these to be serious inequities, but the rabbis of the Talmud did as well. If we examine closely their interpretation of the verses, as found in Tractate Sotah, we will see that they struggled with every one of these issues. Sometimes, what appear to be expansions and clarifications of Torah and nothing more are, in reality, rabbinic responses to complicated and troubling problems."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.10","Of the nine chapters of Tractate Sotah, only the first six address the topic of the <i>sotah</i>. Beyond that there is one key comment in chapter 9. I have selected five topics for close reading."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.11",<b>The Warning and the Seclusion</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.12","Tractate Sotah opens with several statements about warning and seclusion, topics that have no obvious biblical referent."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.13",This passage allows a husband to subject his wife to the ordeal of the bitter waters only if he had issued a warning to her not to talk to a particular man and she then went and secluded herself with him long enough to have had sexual relations with him. Both the warning and the seclusion have to have been witnessed for them to have legal ramifications.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.14","These opening paragraphs, although they appear matter-of-fact, are in many ways astonishing. First, the rabbis interpret the Hebrew root K-N-A to mean “warn,” even though in the Torah in general and in this chapter in particular this verb means to “suffer a fit of jealousy, to be wrought up over.” Second, the rabbis interpret S-T-R<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">M 1:2, <i>bet haSeTeR</i>; also, M 6:1, <i>v’niSTaRah</i>.</i> to mean “closeting” herself with the specified man, not “hidden,” which is what the root means in the Bible—in the sense that her sexual improprieties did not become known.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">New Jewish Publication Society (hereafter, NJPS) translation: “she <i>keeps secret</i> the fact that” (Num. 5:13). Ibn Ezra, a medieval exegete, comments, “She did not reveal the matter.” Albeck, 227.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.15","Why did the rabbis retain these biblical roots, yet stray so radically from their accepted definitions? I think they are deliberately and consciously preserving the sacred text but, at the same time, infusing it with new meaning. Upset that this section deviates from the standard procedures of justice, they attempt to make it conform: They say that the only circumstance in which a husband has the right to force his wife to submit to the ordeal is if he had warned her in advance—in the presence of two witnesses—not to have any contact with a particular man and then two witnesses, or only one witness, or only the husband himself saw her closet herself with that very man long enough to have had sexual relations with him. Delimiting this time span gives rise to much dispute (T Sotah 1:2; BT Sotah 4a), but even the most lenient opinion allows for no more than a few minutes. As the Talmud notes, each rabbi defined the duration of intercourse according to his own experience (4b)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.16","Since witnessing the seclusion is not tantamount to witnessing the sexual act itself (in which case one must testify that he saw “the painting stick inserted into the tube” [Makkot 7a]), such testimony could not normally stand up in a court of law, but here it does raise serious doubts about the behavior of the woman in question. According to these rabbinic rules, only those women who aroused their husband’s suspicion, were publicly warned by him, and then deliberately violated his word in the presence of others could be dragged by him to the Temple for the ordeal. This series of events is a far cry from the Torah’s mere “fit of jealousy.” The intention of the rabbis was to sanction administering the bitter waters only to women who were highly likely to be guilty of what their husbands suspected them of. Most fits of jealousy could not lead to further action on the part of the husband, however, for they involved neither prior warning nor seclusion in the presence of witnesses."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.17","The rabbis sharply reduced the number of instances in which a man could subject his wife to the ordeal of the bitter waters because they recognized that, by their standards, this section of the Torah treats women unfairly. Those who agree that the rabbis reinterpreted the Torah may disagree, however, that their motivation was a concern for women. Some may argue, for instance, that the rabbis’ concern was for justice, a cause they pursued with a passion. I would answer that these concerns are essentially the same. If, as I will show, in case after case in which biblical law treats women inequitably in comparison to men, the rabbis rework it so that women are treated fairly, then differentiating between one motivation and another loses its importance."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.18","One might also argue that the rabbis suppressed this ritual out of their embarrassment over what they perceived as a primitive, barbaric rite within the Jewish legal system. However, were this so, I do not think that they would have made reference, as we will see later, to the paramour’s punishment and to the husband’s possibly spotty past vitiating the results of the test, both of which address the specifically moral problems created by the ritual. When this tractate is read as a whole, we can discern how bothered the rabbis are by the immorality and discriminatory nature of the ordeal, not its barbarism. That latter aspect they almost seem to relish."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.19","Despite the Talmud’s reinterpretation of Torah to make it fairer to women, we cannot fail to notice the considerable residual patriarchy in the way that the Talmud presents the husband-wife relationship. That a husband could warn his wife not to talk with a specific man implies that he had extensive control over her ordinary, day-to-day activities. Although the contextual reading of these paragraphs explains why the rabbis proposed this warning—for her good, not his—even so, we must consider what the passage says about social relationships. A key statement on this topic is found in T Sotah (5:9), the companion volume to the Mishnah dating from the same period of time. I will cite the passage and then spell out its implications."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.20","There are some men who, if a fly alights on the rim of the cup, cannot drink what is inside. This is a bad lot for a woman because a husband like this will decide to divorce her [if she has any contact at all with another man].<br>2. There are men who, if a fly enters the cup, will discard the fly but still not drink what is inside. Such a man is like Pappas b. Judah, who would lock the door on his wife [so that she could not converse with a man] and go out.<br>3. And then there are men who, if a fly falls into the cup, will discard the fly and drink what is inside. This is the way most men are: He sees his wife talking to her [male] neighbors and relatives and leaves her alone.<br>4. Finally, there are men who, if a fly falls into the tureen, will take it, suck out [the liquid], and throw it [the fly] away. So an evil man behaves: He sees his wife going out with her head uncovered, scantily clad, … spinning in the marketplace, and bathing and sporting with any and all men [and does nothing about it]. This kind of woman one should divorce."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.21","First, note that this passage is about problems with men’s behavior, not women’s. Its main point is that a man should be neither too accepting nor too suspicious of his wife’s behavior: He who is finicky is derided (1, 2), as is he whose sexual pleasure is enhanced by his wife’s promiscuity (4). The proper way for a man to behave is to tolerate reasonable social contact between his wife and other men (3)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.22","That this passage originates in Sotah suggests that the husband can also be at fault, unlike the title of the tractate, which implies that the wife is always at fault. The husband’s fit of jealousy can be triggered from within, not just without. Here the rabbis critique themselves, namely men, and implicitly, given the context of this passage, the entire ordeal."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.23","Second, what can we learn from this passage about social relations between men and women in the Talmudic period? In a sex-segregated society, as indicated in Pirkei [= Mishnah] Avot, just conversing with the opposite sex seems to have been an erotic activity. The warning “Do not talk excessively with women … lest it take time away from Torah … and lead you to Gehenna” (M Avot 1:5) does not imply that women are considered intellectually inferior but that men who have casual social relations with women are easily aroused, as the parallel statement in BT Nedarim 20a adds, “lest talking with women lead a man to adulterous behavior.” It is for this reason that a husband would suspect his wife of inappropriate behavior if she engaged in conversation with a man who was neither a neighbor nor a relative, for he knew that the man would have been aroused by the encounter. This passage also creates the impression that the force at greatest odds with the desire to study Torah was the desire for sex. We will return to this subject later."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.24","As for marital relationships, this passage suggests that a husband can legally limit his wife’s social contacts and can even force her to stay at home. Such potential control is clear evidence of the patriarchal construction of Jewish marriage, as is his right to divorce her for any reason. But note that the very source that acknowledges the possibility of despotic control over a wife also denounces it."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.25",<b>The Ordeal in Detail</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.26","After reading the first several paragraphs of Mishnah Sotah and noting their essentially enlightened implications, we are rather disturbed to read what follows—a detailed description of a gruesome ordeal."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.27","The first mention of the ordeal itself appears in 1:4–7. After a number of homilies intervene, the description of the ordeal continues at the beginning of the second chapter, and again, after a break, at the beginning of the third. The Mishnah adds many details to the core ritual presented in the Torah."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.28","The harshness of these statements is appalling. They unquestionably reflect deep rabbinic contempt for a suspected adulteress. At the same time, the details of the ritual seem to have sexual overtones. Ripping off her clothes to partially expose her body is both strange and suggestive. It feeds the sexual fantasies of the bystanders, in particular the young priests (T Sotah 1:7). It is also reminiscent of the treatment of adulterous women by other cultures, who would strip them naked in public, a custom already documented in Hosea 2:5. The <i>mishnah</i> notes the logic of this practice: Since she broke the rules by showing her body to her paramour, she will now be forced to reveal herself to all, a kind of perverted measure for measure. The problem, of course, is that at this stage she is only accused, not yet proven guilty."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.29","How does this description mesh with the sympathetic treatment of women in the opening <i>mishnah</i>s of the tractate? It seems to me that the ordeal represents an older strand of material, very callous and offensive to women, which was later framed by more reasonable statements that reflected a growing dissatisfaction with the ordeal. A fairly standard editorial principle in tannaitic literature is to bracket the earlier layer with a later one, rather than simply to present the sources in chronological order. The strategic advantage of this alternate scheme is that it forces one to read the older sources, which appear second, in light of the newer ones, which appear first. In this tractate, we read about the ordeal only <i>after</i> being informed that the circumstances for carrying it out could almost never arise."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.30",<b>Merit and Its Protection</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.31","After describing the immediate yellowing of the <i>sotah</i>’s face and bulging of her eyes upon drinking the potion, the <i>mishnah</i> (3:4) goes on to limit the cases in which these changes occur: Accumulated merit could protect her and defer the physical devastation for one, two, or even three years. Before assessing the considerable implications of this statement, I will examine the one that follows, surely one of the most memorable in the entire Talmud."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.32","Ben Azzai presents the reason a man is obligated to teach his daughter Torah (and this has to mean Torah in the broad sense, with tannaitic commentary): Should she be warned by her husband not to talk to a particular man, then go and closet herself with him, and be dragged to the Temple and forced to drink the bitter waters, and should she be guilty as suspected, she should know that if she had amassed a record of good deeds, they would delay the harmful effects of the water. Stated succinctly: If she studies Torah, she will know that if she commits adultery, her punishment will be postponed because of the good deeds she has done in the past. It is hard to imagine a more absurd rationale for teaching women Torah!<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">An alternative explanation is that if she is guilty as suspected and finds that the waters do not harm her, she will know that it is her good deeds that have postponed the waters’ taking effect, not their inherent inefficacy. But that, too, is a strange reason to teach women Torah.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.33","I find it remarkable that Ben Azzai is concerned with the mental state of even those women who commit adultery, who, one might argue, deserve to fear for their future. But why is his attitude to them so different from the contemptuous one demonstrated by his colleagues? It is doubtful that he is more forgiving of adultery. More likely, his statement indicates his repudiation of the entire Sotah ritual. Not only does merit protect, as already stated, but a woman should be entrusted with this knowledge in advance in order to alleviate her fear of what Ben Azzai considers to be an excessively harsh ritual."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.34","Interpreted in this way, Ben Azzai’s statement is yet another example of the rabbis’ ability to reflect and comment upon women’s unfair lot in life. He seems to say that this ritual is such a travesty of justice that the only way to rectify matters is to teach women Torah, so that they know that nothing will happen to them for a long time if they drink the water, even if guilty. He thus not only denies the potency of the water to punish sinners, as mentioned without attribution earlier in this passage, but also claims that women, for this immoral and profoundly demeaning way of treating them, must be compensated with Torah study, an activity at the other end of the continuum, one that evinces great respect for the student. That is not surprising coming from a man whose desire is only for the study of Torah, not for women (T Yevamot 8:4)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.35","The mishnaic passage continues with R. Eliezer’s dissenting opinion: One who teaches his daughter Torah is teaching her <i>tiflut</i>, lewdness. This is an almost equally absurd statement. One possible interpretation is that knowledge is dangerous: If a woman knows that the accumulation of good deeds can defer the punishment, she will be tempted to engage in forbidden sexual acts (as if ignorance of this fact were the only deterrent!). Another possible interpretation is that a woman’s inferior intellect will only allow her a limited understanding of Torah, which may then innocently, or even otherwise, lead her astray. Since this same rabbi is reported in the Yerushalmi <i>(ad locum)</i> to have said that it is better to burn the words of Torah than to hand them over to women—a deeply misogynistic sentiment—it is likely that his statement in the Mishnah is to be best understood as a condemnation of women’s intellectual capacities. R. Eliezer would thus be in direct conflict with Ben Azzai, who views women as competent. But why an inferior mind would misunderstand Torah in a way that leads to sexual impropriety is still not clear. R. Joshua, the next speaker in the Mishnah, provides an answer: Were a woman confronted with the choice of more frequent (marital) sex and a lower income or less frequent sex and a higher income, she would choose the former.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Or, according to the version of the text quoted above, a woman likes sex a lot more than abstinence.</i> The context shows that R. Joshua means to say that women are incapable of applying themselves to the serious endeavor of Torah study because of their preoccupation with sex and their great sexual appetite.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Chapter 7 for further comments on this <i>mishnah</i>. See also Daniel Boyarin, <i>Carnal Israel</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), 174–180.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.36","It is quite astonishing that the only place in the Mishnah where the issue of educating women is raised directly is in this context of women’s inappropriate sexual behavior. I, therefore, think it possible that the Mishnah here hints, below the surface, that the reason a man should not teach a woman Torah, or that men and women may not study Torah together (and it is well known that the disciple circles were composed of men only), is not a woman’s intellectual insufficiency but rather a man’s sexual proclivities: When with women, he will find himself unable to observe the boundaries of acceptable social intercourse. What we see here, it seems, is the displacement of great and uncontrollable interest in sexual activity from men to women. It is not she who will be led astray by learning Torah, but he: In the course of teaching it to her he will find himself sexually distracted."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.37","As we will see in Chapter 2, “Relations Between the Sexes,” the Mishnah assumes that men who spend time with women are likely to be aroused by them and may not be able to stop themselves from initiating some kind of sexual involvement (M Kiddushin 4:12). This would be even more likely were the setting deep intellectual exchange. As stated in BT Berakhot 24a, men are aroused by the sight of a woman, any exposed part of her body, and even the sound of a woman’s voice. This assessment supports what was stated above—that talking with women was considered an erotic activity. Note that the same kinds of statements are not made about women. They are portrayed as easily seduced, what the Talmud calls “light-minded” (BT Kiddushin 80b), but not as seducers. Therefore, men’s ideal conditions for Torah study are apart from women. Given all this, it is not surprising that men need to deny that women are intellectually capable."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.38","Mishnah 5, an apparent continuation of the discussion of the ability of merit to protect, cites two more views. R. Simon (b. Yohai) proposes that merit does not protect—if it did, aspersions would be cast on all the innocent women who already submitted to the ordeal and suffered no adverse consequences. Rebbe (R. Judah the Prince) responds that merit does protect—a guilty woman can be distinguished from an innocent one by how she dies, even though she will have continued to live a long time unharmed. The guilty, ultimately, will die a <i>sotah</i>’s death, characterized by slow physical deterioration."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.39","When the redactor of the Mishnah surveyed the views of these rabbis and others found in parallel passages in the Midrash Halakhah,<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Sifrei Bemidbar</i>, 8 (p. 15, Horovitz ed.).</i> he took a stand on several disputed matters: (1) merit does protect; (2) it protects for a long time, even three years, not just for three months, nine months, or one year, as suggested by the others. In this way the redactor rendered the ordeal of no use at all. What would a husband gain from having his wife drink the waters if they would not immediately prove her guilt or innocence? The point of the ritual, according to the Torah, was to calm his jealousy if she were innocent and punish her if she were guilty. The minute the notion of deferred punishment is introduced, the ordeal neither punishes her nor yields the information sought to pacify him."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.40","In terms of the Mishnah’s structure, this section in its redacted form, upholds the outlook of the opening paragraphs of the tractate and goes one step further. Even in the unlikely event that all the conditions for administering the ordeal, set forth at the beginning of the tractate, were fulfilled, this section would destroy all reason to implement a test from which nothing would be learned."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.41",<b>The Paramour</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.42","Chapter 5 of Sotah opens with a statement about the paramour, whose potential existence, until now, has been largely ignored. The Mishnah considers that the superfluous appearance of the phrase “and they shall enter” implies that the waters will test not only the woman who is forced to drink them but also the paramour, wherever he is, by adversely affecting him in the same way as her. This symmetry suggests that the rabbis found it morally unacceptable for only one of two partners in crime to be punished. If she has sinned and is consequently harmed seriously by the waters, then he, too, who would never be charged, should and will, they assert, suffer a similar punishment. (According to. Maimonides [<i>Mishneh Torah</i>, Hilchot Sotah 3:17], he will die the same death that she dies, at the very same moment!)"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.43","The Mishnah goes on to say that just as she is forbidden to her husband until she drinks the bitter waters and even afterwards if she is guilty, so too she is forbidden to the paramour. Should the opportunity arise for her to reconnect with the paramour, because of the death of the husband or divorce, or a delay in punishment for her, the rabbis feel that it would not be right for her to do so. If it were allowed, then this tractate would be teaching a woman how to jettison one man for another: Have an adulterous relationship with the man to whom she took a fancy, arouse her husband’s suspicion, bring it about that he divorce her, and then be free to continue the relationship with the paramour. In fact, the rabbis in M Nedarim 11:12 (and elsewhere) express their fear that women will do exactly that. Note the symmetry in this <i>mishnah:</i> The rabbis speak of two situations, one in which a woman and another in which a man (the husband of an adulteress) is treated unfairly in their eyes, even though the rules of the Torah are followed. Presenting these two situations together, and casting them in the same literary/midrashic form, suggests that the authors were finding fault with the water ordeal in toto, pointing out its pervasive absurdities, and not just tinkering with it to make it more fair."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.44",<b>Abolishing the Ordeal</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.45","The last powerful critique of the ordeal of the bitter waters appears in chapter 9. After discussing the rules of breaking the neck of a calf if a corpse is found near a city (<i>eglah arufah</i>, Deuteronomy 21:1–9), the Mishnah says:"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.46","According to a midrash appearing in both Talmuds (BT Sotah 47b, PT Sotah 9:9; 24a), this <i>mishnah</i> is saying that once sexually immoral behavior becomes standard, the waters will no longer be able to test wives: The husbands of many of these women will be guilty of the same act themselves and therefore ineligible to invoke the test. The midrash derives the need for guiltless men from the concluding verse of the Sotah section (Numbers 5:31), which says that “the man shall be clear of guilt,” implying that only men who are themselves clear of guilt may test their wives. In other words, this ritual was discontinued because of its inherent unfairness: It punished women but not men who committed the very same crime, and who were, themselves, the ones who initiated the test for the women. But the Tosefta (14:2) interprets the <i>mishnah</i> differently. It says that when adultery became common and hence public knowledge, they (the authorities) could no longer administer the bitter waters because the test works only in a case in which there is a doubt and in so many of these cases the transgression was certain.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. Judith Wegner, <i>Chattel or Person?</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), 54.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.47","These different approaches suggest that there are two interpretive stages: The older approach, represented by the Mishnah and the Tosefta, treats the abolition matter-of-factly. According to the <i>mishnah</i>, because there was a backlog of cases, a long line of angry husbands waiting to test their wives, the time-consuming ritual had to be abolished, just like the <i>eglah arufah</i> ritual. The <i>mishnah</i>’s verse from Hosea, supporting the notion that adultery had become rampant, singles out women as adulterers and says that, despite their sin, God would not punish them—an apt prooftext. Note that the verse describes men’s sin as seeking out prostitutes, not adultery. The Tosefta’s tradition, attributed to R. Yohanan b. Zaccai, a Tanna who lived at the end of the Temple period, gives a rationale that is an alternative to the <i>mishnah</i>’s backlog of cases, but still offers no moral critique of the ordeal. However, the later rabbis and also the redactors of the Bavli and Yerushalmi felt the need to explain the Mishnah’s abolition in a different way altogether, as a response to the hypocrisy of a ritual that permitted guilty but unpunished husbands to punish a guilty wife. As time passed, moral instincts seem to have prodded rabbis into explaining the abolition as a moral necessity."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.48","Was this ritual ever carried out? Need one take this line of the Mishnah at face value? There is no obvious answer. Only one mention is made in rabbinic literature of the actual subjection of a woman to this ordeal (Mishnah Eduyot 5:6; PT Sotah 2:5; 18b). We read, however, in Mishnah Yoma 3:10, that Helene, the queen of Adiabene who converted to Judaism in the time of the Second Temple, made several generous donations to the Temple, among them a golden tablet on which were inscribed the verses of Sotah. The purpose of this tablet, presumably, was to make it easier for the <i>kohanim</i> to prepare the Sotah’s scroll. I find it ironic, and a bit too didactic, that a woman would make a gift to the Temple to be used to test women for sin.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. Ilan, <i>Jewish Women</i>, 137.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.49",<b>Conclusions</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.50","What has this holistic study of Mishnah Sotah yielded? To begin with, we saw that the tractate begins on a note that radically transforms Torah, requiring a husband to warn his wife about a particular man and then, only if she paid no attention to the warning and secluded herself with that man in front of witnesses, allowing him to subject her to the ordeal. Whereas the Torah prescribes the ordeal for instances in which there are no witnesses, the rabbis inject witnesses, thus ensuring that the administration of the waters will be permitted only in cases where the man’s jealousy is reasonably justified. So, the tractate opens with a rabbinic rendition of this institution that does not deviate as much from the rules of due process as one may at first think."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.51","Then, in the course of reading through the tractate, we hear the message loud and clear: First, the rabbis are interested in limiting the implementation of this ordeal to the extent that they can; second, they believe that with divine intervention, the paramour, too, if there was one, will be punished exactly as she is; third, they believe that a history of good deeds on her part will postpone the implementation of the punishment; and, finally, because so many men were committing adultery with so many women, they abolish the ordeal of the bitter waters altogether."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.52","This tractate, although it presents a detailed, gruesome description of the ritual, bordering, one might say, on the pornographic, at the same time suppresses this hostile and offensive core by the later addition of the elements mentioned above. When we read this tractate, we get the impression that overriding the disdain and even disgust the rabbis feel for a woman who may have been extramaritally involved is the even greater dislike they had for the ritual itself, probably because of its inherent injustice: An innocent woman could be humiliated, whereas a guilty man could be neither humiliated nor punished. On the surface, this tractate appears to endorse and develop the ritual of the bitter waters as set down by the Torah, but in reality, in all of its elaborate expansion, the rabbis eliminate this ancient ritual, paragraph by paragraph, until, almost anticlimactically, at the end of the volume, they supply a historical note, that the waters were, in fact, abolished by R. Yohanan b. Zaccai.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">A very brief version of this chapter appears in my article “An Assessment of Women’s Liberation in the Talmud,” in <i>Conservative Judaism</i> 26, no. 4 (Summer 1972).</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.53","All of this change notwithstanding, the image of marriage presented in this tractate and related rabbinic materials is one of a dominant husband and subordinate wife. As in other tractates, marriage is constructed here as a patriarchal institution: Men take women to be their wives, may dismiss them at will, and may deny them the compensation set forth in the <i>ketubah</i> if they have transgressed the rules of Jewish marriage, such as the requirement of fidelity. Although the rabbis do give a man these rights, they warn him time and again not to exercise absolute control over his wife."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.54","It seems to me that the major achievement of the rabbis of the Talmud with regard to women, in this tractate and also in general, was significantly to improve their status in a variety of important areas. Since by the rabbis’ own account, the ordeal of the bitter waters was abolished in the last days of the Temple, and thus was completely inoperative for most of the rabbinic period, this entire tractate may be seen as a lengthy statement of rabbinic dissatisfaction with patriarchy as they knew it. Moreover, since the men in this tractate were not, in fact, yielding any new rights to women or making any concessions in their comments, which almost explicitly reject the ordeal, they probably intended to show that rabbis take action when they see unjust treatment of women. Such action does not mean that they granted women full equality with men, such as the ability to make demands of marital fidelity on a husband, but that, within a patriarchal framework, they took steps to reduce women’s legal disabilities."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.55","Throughout this chapter we have read the Bible through the eyes of the rabbis, noting how they adapted a single biblical institution to their more progressive social outlook. It is noteworthy that a similar claim has been made by Bible scholars about the biblical institution of Sotah itself. As grossly unjust as Sotah may seem to the uninitiated reader of the Bible, when read in the context of Ancient Near Eastern literature, the ritual appears to have been reworked by the priestly legislators “in order to protect a suspected but unproved adulteress from the vengeance of an irate husband or community by mandating that God will decide her case.”<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>The JPS Torah Commentary, Numbers</i>, 354.</i> Strange as it may sound, the point of the biblical reworking of the ordeal, according to Jacob Milgrom, is to improve women’s lives. Just as Milgrom has read Bible in its ancient setting—literary, legal, and social—so have I attempted to read Talmud. And it has yielded similar results: although Tractate Sotah seems sexist on the surface, a contextualized reading shows that the underlying intent of the rabbis is to erase the inequities of the ritual and thereby diminish, although not eradicate, its patriarchy."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Sotah.56",<b>Notes</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.1","T<small>HE PICTURE THAT EMERGES</small> from many Talmudic passages is that society in the rabbinic period was both sex-segregated and patriarchal. Was it permissible, in such a society, for men and women to engage in social and intellectual exchange of ideas? The answer is no."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.2","A close reading of the key texts on the subject of relations between the sexes will show that the reason for this ban was that men found themselves easily aroused in the presence of women and therefore did not trust themselves to be alone with them. It is hard to say whether such a low threshold of sexual arousal is the result of living in a society in which dealing with women was sufficiently rare that it heightened their sexual attraction for men, or whether just the opposite obtained: Because of men’s sexual nature, it was necessary for them to live their lives, not with women, but parallel to them."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.3","As much as we will try to understand what these texts have to say on the subject, we must recognize that the conditions of life in the rabbinic period were so different from those of today, the lack of privacy being just one example, that we cannot be sure that we are properly understanding the nature of men’s and women’s relationships. Even today, relationships between the sexes differ so greatly in the West and East that it is hard for someone in one culture to understand properly human relations in another."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.4","The theory proposed—that men recognized that their own sexual nature makes social interchange with women impossible—is at odds with much current thinking on gender relations in rabbinic culture. Jacob Neusner suggests that men view women as anomalous, dangerous, dirty, and polluting, and in possession of an unruly sexual potential that is lying there just below the surface.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">Jacob Neusner, <i>Method and Meaning in Ancient Judaism</i>, Brown Judaica Series, no. 10 (Missoula, Mont.: Scholars Press, 1979), 97.</i> Judith Wegner says that rabbis ascribe to women moral laxity.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">Wegner, <i>Chattel or Person?</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), 159–162.</i> David Biale writes that according to the rabbis, women are “incapable of willed sexual restraint.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">David Biale, <i>Eros and the Jews</i> (New York: Basic Books, 1992), 57.</i> Leonie Archer claims that the rabbis consider women to be insatiable sexual aggressors.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Leonie Archer, <i>Her Price Is Beyond Rubies: The Jewish Woman in Graeco-Roman Palestine</i>, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament Series, 60 (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1990), 105.</i> Michael Satlow says that although men and women were both thought to be sexually desirous, only men were thought capable of controlling their desire.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Michael Satlow, <i>Tasting the Dish: Rabbinic Rhetorics of Sexuality</i> (Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars Press, 1995), 158.</i> According to all of these authors, men, rather than accepting responsibility for their own sexual misbehavior, blame women for instigating it. These theories fit in with, or are the consequence of, these authors’ general sense that men viewed women as Other."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.5","I have no quarrel with the fact that men in ancient societies, and even today, view women as Other. But that does not necessarily imply that they impute evil or depravity to women. On the contrary, I find in the Talmudic sources three general principles or observations that recognize the complexity of sexuality: (1) as already noted, men are easily aroused sexually by being in the presence of women, looking at them, dressed or undressed, or even just thinking about them; (2) women, in general, do not actively try to entice men; (3) sexual attraction in and of itself is considered to be normal and natural but, because it demands resolution, can easily lead to violation of social and religious norms.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">It does seem to be the case, though, that over time, some rabbis began to display a negative attitude to the sexual urge, particularly in that it competed with the desire to study Torah. See further discussion.</i> I will try in the course of this chapter to show that these principles emerge when we read in entirety a rabbinic unit on sexual relations between men and women and compare the views of the Mishnah, Tosefta, Bavli, and Yerushalmi to each other. Only when these materials are examined out of context does it become possible to reach other conclusions. To their credit, the rabbis seem to be aware of some aspects of their own psychological makeup."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.6","The subject not addressed in these passages is what women feel about sex. Although women are central to this material in that they are the source of sexual tension for men, their own opinions are not recorded. Nor do men have much to say about women’s sexuality except to acknowledge that women, too, have a need for sexual satisfaction. The halakhic corollary is that since women are subordinate to their husbands and hence not free openly to seek satisfaction, the rabbis require men to meet their wives’ sexual needs."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.7","One other point to keep in mind as we read through this material is that just as the chapters in the Bible on forbidden sexual liaisons (Leviticus 18 and 20) place a man at the center and proceed to list the women with whom he may not enter into sexual contact, the Mishnah too, when discussing sexual matters, looks at the world with a man’s eyes. Similarly, just as laws affecting women in the Bible are, for the most part, a derivative of laws affecting men, so too in the Mishnah rules affecting women must be derived from those affecting men."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.8",<b>Men and Women Alone Together</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.9","The key set of statements on the topic of relations between the sexes appears in chapter 4 of Tractate Kiddushin. After dealing with lineage and with appropriate and inappropriate marital unions, the Mishnah moves on to another topic altogether, relationships between men and women who are not married to each other."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.10","The first part of the <i>mishnah</i> states the well-known rule that men and women may not be alone together, but it distinguishes between prohibiting one man from being alone with several women and permitting one woman to be alone with several men. If we read this part of the <i>mishnah</i> independently of its context, at least two reasons for the distinction come to mind: Either men need to be protected from being seduced by women, or women need to be protected from being seduced by men. In order to find out which of these explanations is right, we need to read these rules in the context of those that follow."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.11","The second clause of the <i>mishnah</i>, about relations between family members, makes the assumption that a father is not aroused sexually by sleeping naked in the same bed as his young daughter, with their bodies touching, that a young boy is not aroused by sleeping together with his mother, nor, we may assume, is a mother aroused by her young son. That is, immature bodies do not bring about sexual arousal in others or experience it themselves. But once a man matures physically, he will experience involuntary sexual arousal if he is in close physical contact with either his mother or a physically mature daughter. Therefore, although they may still sleep in the same bed, they may not do so naked, but each wrapped in his or her own garment."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.12","This second part of the <i>mishnah</i> sheds light on the first. In this second case, the father, mother, son, or daughter is not intent on enticing anyone to engage in a sexual act. The <i>mishnah</i> is dealing with a situation, in this case a family bed, in which a man will, <i>without intending to</i>, find himself sexually aroused by sleeping in bodily contact with a naked woman, even his own mother or daughter. The <i>mishnah</i>’s law offers advice on how to avoid such arousal: Have each of them wrap themselves in his or her own blanket-like garment."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.13","It follows that the first part of the <i>mishnah</i>, men and women finding themselves alone with each other, is also describing a situation in which men are not actively trying to entice women, nor are women actively trying to entice men. Even so, men will find themselves aroused sexually simply by being secluded with women. To guard a man from interacting sexually with an unattended woman, a likely outcome of their being alone together, the <i>mishnah</i> recommends that he make sure another man or else his own wife is present. The juxtaposition of these two sections within one <i>mishnah</i> makes it very unlikely that in the first part women are actively trying to seduce men whereas in the second men are trying to contend with involuntary sexual arousal. Since, in addition, the second part of the <i>mishnah</i> uses the same key term as the first part—“to be alone with” [<span dir=""rtl"">להתיחד עם</span>]—they constitute one literary unit on the topic of seclusion, involuntary sexual arousal and its routine consequence, illicit sexual activity."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.14","Note that this <i>mishnah</i> is written with a man’s concerns in view. It is he who will find himself unable to resist sexual temptation when in the presence of an unattended woman or women. For the <i>mishnah</i>, sexual arousal in these circumstances is natural, uncomplicated, involuntary, and perceived of as bad only if it leads a man into sexual transgression. To prevent him from engaging in a sexual act when alone with a woman, the <i>mishnah</i> forbids a man from allowing himself to be found in such a situation.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">Since the Mishnah allows no seclusion of men with any women at all, even unmarried, it is concerned not just about the violation of Jewish law by men with married or consanguineous women but also about promiscuous behavior of men with unmarried women.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.15","The reason that two men may be alone with one woman but two women may not be alone with one man has to do with a man’s controlling his instincts: In both cases a female presence excites a man, but in the first instance, the presence of someone else like himself will inhibit him from pursuing gratification, whereas in the second, in the presence of women only, he will not be embarrassed to carry out his sexual design. We will return to this subject later."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.16",The next <i>mishnah</i> continues to deal with the subject of involuntary sexual arousal:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.17","No reason is given for why an unmarried man may not teach young children. The simple explanation, raised and then immediately rejected by both Talmuds (BT Kiddushin 82a; PT Kiddushin 4:11; 66c), is that an unmarried man’s pent-up libido may lead him to molest the students sexually.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">T AZ 3:2 fears such sexual molestation if a gentile teacher is hired for a Jewish child. Kutheans are not suspected of such behavior (T AZ 3:1).</i> As close to the meaning of the words as this explanation is—exploitation of schoolchildren is a problem to this very day—it would force us to say, in parallel fashion, that a woman, unmarried or <i>even married</i>, is similarly suspect. Since no statistics support the notion that women are <i>more</i> frequent sexual offenders of children than men, that is not likely to be the view of women’s sexual nature that the rabbis are expressing in these texts."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.18","The two Talmuds propose instead that unmarried men may not serve as teachers because of the mothers who accompany young students to school, and women, unmarried or even married, may not serve as teachers because of the fathers who accompany young students to school.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">BT Kiddushin 82a; PT Kiddushin 4:11; 66c. The Bavli offers symmetrical explanations for male and female teachers; the Yerushalmi only explains why men may not serve as teachers. This possibly means that the Yerushalmi discounted the notion of women not teaching children.</i> This means that an unmarried man may not be a teacher of young children because he will come into contact with a student’s mother, become aroused by her, and commit a sexual violation. Overpowered by him, she will be unable to say no. The rule about women serving as teachers does not make reference to marital status because the rabbis think that any woman, married or unmarried, will arouse a man. They are not saying, therefore, that the female teacher will attempt to seduce the student’s father but only that he will attempt to seduce her. This alternate interpretation, which focuses on adults and not children, is reasonable in light of the topic of the entire section—a man’s low threshold of arousal and lack of control in subduing it. If a man does not have a sexual outlet, the chances of involuntary arousal followed by sexual transgression are even higher. I think it possible that the <i>mishnah</i> at some point in time referred to child abuse, in at least the first clause about men. But from the time of the Talmud and on—and maybe even earlier—the interpreters saw it as referring only to the behavior of adults among themselves.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">Wegner (<i>Chattel or Person?</i> 160) cites BT Kiddushin 82a and says that the presence of a child will not discourage a woman or a man from fornicating with each other. Because women are viewed as morally lax, the <i>mishnah</i> does not distinguish between married and unmarried women. Ilan (<i>Jewish Women in Greco-Roman Palestine</i> [Tübingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 1995], 193) also interprets the <i>mishnah</i> according to the Talmud (PT Kiddushin 4:11; 66c).</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.19","In this next <i>mishnah</i>, R. Judah seems to be worried about involuntary sexual arousal or illicit sexual activity when an unmarried man is in close physical contact with another man or even, as offensive as this sounds to us today, with cattle. The rabbis disagree with him, apparently because they think that such behavior is not prevalent among Jews, as they say explicitly in T Kiddushin 5:10 (<span dir=""rtl"">לא נחשדו ישראל על כך</span>, Jews are not suspected of that)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.20",The <i>mishnah</i> continues:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.21","This passage again suggests that when a man spends time alone with women, he will be sexually aroused, leading him to engage in forbidden sexual acts. As noted above, she is likely to be overpowered by him and unable to resist. I do not see any suggestion here that the women are actively tempting him or that women are to be looked upon as evil and conniving or even morally lax. Rather, this <i>mishnah</i> is a straightforward and almost matter-of-fact presentation of the pitfalls of men’s physical responses to being with women, and for some men to being with other men or even cattle, in the event that a man does not have a licit sexual outlet. By mentioning that he is a bachelor, the <i>mishnah</i> puts the onus on him. It is he who, because of his suppressed libido, finds himself more easily aroused involuntarily by close contact with women, other men, or even animals."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.22","The <i>mishnah</i> here accepts what it perceives as men’s sexual nature and tries to restrain it. Just as the rabbis tell people to avoid any actions that may lead them to violate the Sabbath,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">An example would be reading by the light of an oil lamp, which may lead someone inadvertently to tilt the lamp to get it to burn more brightly and thereby kindle a flame on the Sabbath. See T Shabbat 1:12, 13.</i> so too do they tell men to stay away from women because of the likelihood of attraction, arousal, and the likely result, sexual activity. There is no suggestion here that the women themselves are deliberately trying to entice men, as the Mishnah elsewhere suggests about women who bare their arms in the marketplace, engage men in conversation, and bathe publicly with them, all activities the Mishnah perceives to be clearly designed to lure men into sexual activity (M Ketubot 7:6 and T Sotah 5:9). Here it is the men who seem unable to control themselves in the presence of women and who need other men to inhibit them from unacceptable sexual activity."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.23","It is remarkable that the Mishnah considers a wife to be an appropriate guardian of her husband’s chastity, since, in most cases, she could not restrain him physically. But the assumption seems to be that she has a vested interest in keeping him away from sexual encounters with other women. Therefore, she will see to it, probably in subtle or morally admonishing ways, that he will not find himself aroused or, at least, not able to act on such arousal."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.24",The parallel passages in the Tosefta sharpen our understanding of these <i>mishnah</i>s.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.25","According to the beginning of this statement, even men who are not fully Jewish, such as Kutheans and pagan slaves,<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">Pagan slaves are regarded by the rabbis as individuals who are on their way to becoming Jewish. The rabbis required the owners of slaves to circumcise the males and obligated all slaves to observe all mitzvot except for the time-bound positive ones. Upon manumission a slave attained not just freedom but also Jewish status. Kutheans are people whose Samaritan ancestors converted to Judaism not on principle but out of fear. See 2 Kings 17:24ff. They are regarded by the rabbis as neither fully Jewish nor fully pagan.</i> may be alone with a Jewish woman. From this we can conclude that the rabbis did not fear that women would seduce men, for if they did, why would they distinguish between one man, fully Jewish, and another, not fully Jewish—all would be equally vulnerable to her initiatives. On the contrary, this statement implies that as long as a man has some connection to Judaism, he can be trusted not to force himself on her in the presence of another man. As for mature pagan men, she cannot be alone even with one hundred. Why? I do not think the rabbis fear that she would seduce one after the other of these more seducible pagan men. More likely, the rabbis’ concern is that no matter how many of them there are, they will shamelessly engage in sexual activity with her, even in the presence of ninety-nine others, without a single one of them interfering with the seduction or, more accurately, the rape."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.26","The above passage also says that a woman may not be alone with one man and a minor because <i>she</i> would not be embarrassed to have sexual relations with the mature man in the presence of a minor. This can be understood as saying that it is not men who actively seduce women but women who actively seduce men.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">Wegner (<i>Chattel or Person?</i> 160) comments: “The sages’ androcentric perspective blames the dangers of private encounters between the sexes on women’s moral laxity rather than on men’s greater susceptibility to arousal.” I disagree.</i> But given the immediately preceding and following statements about men who either can or cannot restrain themselves from engaging an unattended woman in sexual activity, I think such an interpretation is not likely. What the passage may be saying is that a grown man will become sexually aroused when with a woman and that the presence of a minor will not deter him or <i>even her</i> the way the presence of an adult male would. Minors do not count. According to this interpretation, the passage assumes that she engages in sex consensually."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.27","It goes without saying that a man may not be secluded with only one woman because of the opportunity they would have to engage in sexual relations, but one might still think that he could be alone with a female relative. However, the Tosefta says that seclusion with <i>any</i> female relative is not allowed. Another adult must be present. This law could be seen as a direct contradiction of the <i>mishnah</i> that says that he may be alone with his mother when he is young, or with his daughter when she is young, and even sleep with them in the same bed. But there is no necessary conflict. Either this rule already assumes and accepts the exceptions listed in the <i>mishnah</i> and talks about other female relations, not mentioned in the <i>mishnah</i>, or else this rule is older than the related <i>mishnah</i> and the <i>mishnah</i> comes to relax its restrictions somewhat. The <i>mishnah</i>’s rationale seems to be, as noted above, that it is hard to imagine sexual arousal between a father and a young daughter and a mother and a young son. Furthermore, it would be hard to prohibit parents and children from being alone together, given that they live under the same roof.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">Samuel, as quoted later in the Gemara, does not make <i>any</i> exceptions to the rule of men not being alone with women, even relatives. He may derive his view from a literal understanding of this passage in the Tosefta.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.28",The Tosefta continues:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.29","If we assume that these passages from the Tosefta were known to the redactor of the <i>mishnah</i> we looked at above (4:14), we can see that he changed these statements slightly. He simply said that the Sages allow such seclusion, thereby implying, without saying so explicitly, that, according to them, Jews do not engage in homosexual behavior or bestiality.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">M AZ 2:1 says, “One may not leave cattle in the inns of pagans because they are suspected of bestiality. Similarly, a woman may not be alone with non-Jews because they are suspected of sexual transgression.” See also T AZ 3:2.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.30","But note that what we are talking about here, it seems, is involuntary arousal. The <i>mishnah</i>’s statement that the Sages allow two unmarried men, those with no licit sexual outlet, to sleep together in one tallit implies that the Sages do not fear involuntary homosexual arousal and, its likely consequence, homosexual relations.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">The possibility of self-gratification by means of masturbation is not raised here or anywhere else. The rabbis banned such behavior. See M Niddah 2:1, BT Niddah 13a-b, and PT Niddah 2:1; 49d. See a full discussion of this matter by Michael L. Satlow, “‘Wasted Seed,’ The History of a Rabbinic Idea,” <i>HUCA</i> 65 (1994).</i> R. Judah disagrees: Whether the two men chose to sleep this way for warmth or for sexual arousal, it is not allowed because of the possible outcome of sexual relations. The Tosefta’s wording of the Sages’ statement—that Jews are not suspected of “that,” of homosexual or even homoerotic behavior—means that according to the Tosefta the Sages recognize the possibility that the reason that two pagan men may choose to sleep in one tallit is to arouse themselves sexually; Jewish men, they feel, would not do so and hence may sleep in close physical contact.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Satlow, <i>Tasting the Dish</i>, 208–209.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.31",The Tosefta’s last statement on the subject of relations between the sexes upholds the points made above.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.32","To stray from the subject for a moment, this passage of the Tosefta, which also appears in the Bavli (Kiddushin 82a), paints an interesting picture of a woman’s life in Talmudic times, similar in many ways to that of the Roman matron. This passage presents a list of the kind of men who went from house to house to peddle their services or their wares.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">Susan Treggiari, in <i>Roman Marriage</i>: <i>Iusti Coniuges from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 421, says that the Roman <i>matrona</i> could receive visitors during the day in the atrium, where she sat in a chair and supervised the work of the household. These visitors included tradesmen to whom she had given commissions, peddlers who laid their wares at her feet, men and women asking for favors, her own servants, and so on.</i> Were these men in a fixed place of business, one would not say that their business was with women; if they sold flax and wool in the marketplace, they would sell to all. Rather, it seems that many of these people performed their work at the home of the client or else made a series of visits to the home to check on the progress of their handiwork. For that reason, that they could find themselves in a woman’s home alone with her, the Tosefta issues a warning that they should avoid doing so."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.33","This source suggests that the concepts of private and public domains were blurred in those days.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">See the comments on this issue by Miriam Peskowitz, in her forthcoming book <i>Spinning Fantasies</i>. See also my chapter “Feminist Perspectives on Rabbinic Texts,” in <i>Feminist Perspectives on Jewish Studies</i>, ed. Lynn Davidman and Shelly Tanenbaum (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994), 45.</i> The home was not a private place in which a woman was sequestered. There appears to have been a constant stream of people passing through.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">Tal Ilan, in “A Window onto the Public Domain—Jewish Women in the Time of the Second Temple,” in <i>Eshnav Lehayeihen Shel Nashim B’Hevrot Yehudiot</i>, ed. Yael Azmon (Jerusalem: Mercaz Shazar, 1995), 47–62, says that rabbinic literature prescribes absolute separation of the sexes but that the picture that emerges from historical texts is different and is class based. Upper-class women behaved according to their own set of more-secluding norms, and poor women according to more-relaxed norms. There is thus much variety in the lives of Jewish women in the land of Israel at that period of time.</i> In addition, male and female servants worked in the home and were supervised by the mistress of the household. With respect to the public sphere, many sources indicate that women shopped in the market, went to the baths, visited friends and relatives,<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">Supporting this notion are the <i>mishnah</i>s in the sixth chapter of Shabbat that talk about jewelry and related items that a woman may and may not wear out into the street on the Sabbath. This implies that women dressed up and walked about in the public domain on the Sabbath.</i> and showed up at court and public lectures.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">Treggiari, <i>Roman Marriage</i> (423), says that the social activities of an upperclass matron included frequenting galleries, colonnades, temples, synagogues, theaters, the circus, the games, triumphs, and resorts outside Rome. Women played dice. Married women went out to visit their friends, met them at the baths, strolled with them in places of public resort, and so on.</i> I am not suggesting that men and women engaged in the same kind of work—women were more domestic and men were engaged in agriculture or commerce, and, of course, there were significant differences resulting from social class—but that women’s work, although at home, did not isolate them in the way a woman who works at home today is isolated. The distinction between public and private meant something different in Talmudic times than it does today. It is therefore incorrect to talk about women’s private role as opposed to men’s public one, a favorite theme of much recent literature on life in the Talmudic period."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.34","To return to the topic at hand: What emerges from all of this material is a sense that men are easily aroused by women and that they will follow through with sexual activity, even engage in forbidden sexual liaisons, unless restrained by the presence of others. We can generalize and say that men are not calm in women’s presence; that there is always a degree of sexual tension. It is for this reason that the rabbis decided to legislate against their being alone together."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.35","We will now turn to the Talmudic commentary on these tannaitic passages. Following the halakhic discussion, a string of anecdotes will draw connections between law and life, thus further supporting the conclusions we reached above."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.36","The light-mindedness referred to here is not intellectual but sexual. This statement, ostensibly a tannaitic source,<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">The collection <i>Seder Elijah</i> is actually post-Talmudic. Individual passages like this one were probably circulating in the Talmudic period.</i> is saying that each of the two women will allow herself to be seduced by the man with whom she finds herself, despite the presence of another woman. It does not mean that each of them will attempt to seduce him, as the later discussion makes clear. Unfortunately, this statement has been widely quoted as evidence that the rabbis disparaged a woman’s intellectual capabilities. Although the words themselves may suggest that, and it would be hard to argue that this quote could not aptly be put to that use, for the record, one should note that in this context its meaning is sexual. “Light-mindedness” here means lacking a strong enough will to resist that which one is being pressed into doing.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">In its one other usage in the Bavli, this phrase makes reference to the belief that women, when tortured, will reveal secret information (BT Shabbat 33b). The phrase <i>kalei da’at</i>, with the two Hebrew words reversed, also appears in <i>Sifrei Bemidbar</i>, 103 (p. 102, Horowitz ed.), in association with the term <i>hedyotot</i>, simple people. It thus seems to have had two related but different meanings. <i>Kalut rosh</i>, also light-headedness, is a term that appears in BT Succah 51b, to describe the immodest behavior of women and men in the Temple on the holiday of Succot, during the feast of the water libation. Cf. Rashi (BT AZ 18b, s.v. <i>v’ikka d’amrei</i>), who says that Beruriah ridiculed the rabbis for saying that women were light-headed, in the sexually seducible sense. See also M Avot 3:13.</i> She did not say no, in their opinion, because of her own shortcomings, not because of the hard-to-withstand pressure a man placed on her."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.37","Even if this passage does not mean that women actively entice men, as I argue, it does seem to represent a partial shifting of responsibility from men to women for sexual misadventure. That is possibly an expression of men’s sentiment, or wishful thinking, that they would not have sinned had the women only resisted the advances."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.38",The Gemara continues with a scriptural derivation in support of sex segregation:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.39","This statement of R. Ishmael contradicts the <i>mishnah</i> that allows a man to be alone not just with his mother but also his daughter, and even to sleep together with them, in physical contact, until the time of physical maturation (of the boy who sleeps together his mother or the girl who sleeps together with her father). The existence of a tannaitic dispute on this subject suggests that it was undergoing debate and change."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.40","Starting with the following text, the Gemara openly subscribes to the notion that men’s ease of involuntary sexual arousal is the primary reason for the social separation of the sexes."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.41","R. Joseph’s remark about men as partners in crime suggests, yet again, that it is men’s shame in the presence of each other that restrains them from having sexual relations with the women among them. For certain transgressions, such as stealing, the shame can be suppressed. “Fit” men, however, will refrain from engaging in sexual relations in the presence of another man. Note that it is not a man’s sense of violation of Jewish law that stops him from committing the act, but his sense of shame in front of someone else. Were he totally alone with the woman, nothing, probably not even her saying no, would stop him. A social-status argument can be suggested even here: The reason for the difference in ruling in the two clauses of the <i>mishnah</i>—that one man may not be alone with two women but one woman may be alone with two men—is that a man is embarrassed to breach conventions of proper behavior in the presence of fit men, his social equals, but not in the presence of women, his social inferiors."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.42","Let me point out once more that these observations could only be made if we read these sources in context. If we examine the first two clauses of the <i>mishnah</i> independently, we could conclude that the reason for the differential ruling is that women actively seek to entice men; it is only when another man is present that each can protect the other from her sexual advances. As absurd as I think such fear of women sounds in a patriarchal setting, nevertheless, one cannot properly refute the notion until one reviews the broad literary and legal context of this <i>mishnah</i>. Such a reading shows that the rabbis are not worried about active enticement on anyone’s part; rather, they are worried about men’s inability to control themselves once they are aroused involuntarily."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.43",The Gemara continues with a series of anecdotes about rabbis and sexual arousal.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.44","This story, like the others that will follow, makes it abundantly clear that ordinary men and even rabbis, who are ordinary men but are assumed to be more in control of themselves because of their commitment to mitzvot, are not immune to visual stimulation. They, too, need to remove themselves from the situation in which they find themselves, <i>even if Jewish law allows it</i>. Despite the <i>mishnah</i>’s ruling, the presence of a second man seems to be no guarantee that the first will not attempt to pursue and seduce an unattended woman, even if he is an individual who takes the rules seriously, such as the very rabbi who formulated them. Sexual temptation and arousal overtake even men like that. The best advice, they say about themselves, is to avoid compromising circumstances. Note that the woman in this story is not paying them any attention but merely going on her way. It is they who inadvertently approach her from behind and find themselves vulnerable to sexual arousal."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.45","After some discussion of related matters, the Gemara continues:"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.46","In this story, as in the others, a rabbi who is loyal to Jewish law finds himself sexually aroused, burning with passion, simply by seeing the shadow of one of the women in his upper chamber. His desire is so overpowering that he is able to execute a superhuman feat in seeking to satisfy it. But in attempting to regain control of himself when halfway to his destination, he summons help. The presence of others stops him from sexual transgression. This point merits attention. As strong as sexual desire is, it is immediately extinguished, or at least suppressed, when others appear. It was not knowledge of the law, respect for it, or fear of punishment in the world-to-come that enabled him to accept frustration of desire. He required the presence of other men to do so."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.47","Note that this story demonizes the sexual urge, portraying it as an independent being that has invaded the body of the rabbi and is later forced to leave. Rather than view his sexuality as a natural part of himself, to be satisfied in appropriate circumstances, he fears it and wants to be rid of it.<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">Is this story a turning point in terms of how people view their innate sexual nature? Can we say that in the tannaitic period they accepted their sexual selves as a normal part of their being but that later, in the amoraic period, they were beginning to fight against and suppress their sexuality?</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.48","Two stories about Tannaim follow. The issue in these is not the seclusion of men with women but the ease with which men are sexually stimulated and goaded into action. This unit of commentary opened with the statement that women are easily seduced, but the anecdotal material that follows ironically indicates just the opposite, that it is men who are easily aroused and single-minded in pursuing release."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.49","Written in Aramaic, these two stories are probably an amoraic retelling or reshaping of older, tannaitic material. As in the story about R. Amram, here, too, rabbis are easily aroused by the sight of a woman and unable to withstand temptation. But in these instances the rabbi is stayed, not by his own hand, but by Satan’s. Once Satan shows them that they are like all men in their inability to resist, he does not let them break the rules but merely chastises them for having succumbed. He teaches the rabbis that rather than mock others for their inability to avoid sin, they should be sympathetic because they themselves are no different."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.50","These anecdotes have far-reaching implications. That Satan stops tormenting the two men because of their amassed merit of Torah study implies that such study has cumulative protective power. This notion allows us to return to a <i>mishnah</i> treated in Chapter 1 and interpret it differently. M Sotah 3:5 says that if a woman who drank the bitter waters possessed accumulated “merit,” then that merit would postpone the onset of punishment. We can now suggest that the merit in question is that of Torah study: Just as here it protected the two rabbis from sexual sin and punishment, so too, with respect to the <i>sotah</i>, the <i>mishnah</i> is saying that if she studied Torah, that fact would postpone the onset of the punishment (if she had, in fact, sinned). There does not seem to be any reason that the protective powers of Torah study would be limited to men.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Gemara (BT Sotah 21a) actually raises but then rejects this interpretation.</i> Now we can understand Ben Azzai’s statement that follows, obligating a father to teach his daughters Torah, so that they know that if they ever have to drink the bitter waters their “merit” will postpone punishment. Ben Azzai must mean that their accumulated merit of Torah study will protect them.<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">Some say that Ben Azzai wants them to learn Torah, i.e., to learn that merit protects an unfaithful wife, so that should they sin and drink and not immediately suffer punishment, they will understand that it is not that the waters are not effective but that their own accumulated merits are giving them a period of grace. See Kiddushin 30b, where the study of Torah is the antidote to the evil inclination. Torah, here, is not just knowledge but knowing that knowledge protects.</i> In both of these cases—M Sotah and the anecdotes here—the (purported) sin is sexual and the protection from sin or from punishment comes from the study of Torah. For men such an opportunity exists, according to these anecdotes in tractate Kiddushin; for women, only according to Ben Azzai in tractate Sotah.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Daniel Boyarin’s fascinating analysis of this <i>mishnah</i> and its associated interpretation in the Bavli and Yerushalmi, in <i>Carnal Israel</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), 174–180).</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.51",The next page of Talmud (81b) presents yet another story about men’s complacency. It too mocks men who believe themselves to be above temptation.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.52","This story, more than the others, drives home the point that even the most pious and learned of men are involuntarily aroused when they gaze upon a woman. It also shows that the Talmud strenuously objects to sexual asceticism. This particular sage, who seemed to think that sexual relations in and of themselves were bad, had ceased sexual activity with his wife. But when a prostitute showed an interest in him, he immediately succumbed, even, remarkably, abandoning the Torah that he was studying. That is, what distracts men from Torah study is sexual thoughts or fantasies. This association, again, helps us understand why the discussion of women and the study of Torah appears in the context of a discussion of women and sexual transgression (M Sotah 3:5). We may now conclude that, according to most Tannaim, it is not knowledge of Torah that will lead a woman astray, as claimed by R. Eliezer—who says that teaching a woman Torah is teaching her lewdness—but rather the opposite: that Torah offers those who study it a refuge and respite from their consuming sexual drives.<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">See BT Yoma 35b. The question addressed to an evil man, when he comes to judgment after death, is: Why didn’t you spend time studying Torah? The Gemara answers that if he says, “Because I was handsome and had to attend to my sexual needs [<span dir=""rtl"">נאה הייתי וטרוד ביצרי</span>] [and this left me no time for Torah study],” then say to him, “Were you more handsome than Joseph? … ”</i> And also, as noted above in the stories about R. Akiva and R. Meir, the very study of Torah will protect them in the future from contemplated sexual misadventure."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.53","This story is different from the others in that a woman speaks up about her sexual desires and needs. R. Hiyya bar Ashi’s wife says, apparently in a tone of regret and wistfulness, that he has not engaged in sexual activity with her for several years. She then devises a way to satisfy herself and also, at the same time, find out if he still possesses the sexual impulses from which he keeps asking God to protect him. In addition to saying that women want sex, this story also teaches that women are not, for the most part, evil temptresses, but devoted, long-suffering wives, and even wise, resolute, and appropriately assertive women. In the course of praising women, the Talmud, as is its wont, discredits a man, in particular, his renunciation of sexual activity. R. Hiyya is a hypocrite: He shuns sexual activity for a long period of time, thus ignoring his wife’s needs and rights; he throws himself on the ground each day to ask for God’s protection from sexual sin, implying that he was sexually active even though he was not; as soon as a woman shows interest in him, he falls prey to temptation. This story is thus about vanity just as much as it is about sexual desire."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.54","Note also the biblical echoes of this episode. In Genesis 38, after Judah refuses to arrange a levirate marriage with his third son for Tamar, his twice widowed, childless daughter-in-law, he himself engages in sexual relations with her, thinking her a prostitute. She first secures from him several personal items for future use. When her resulting pregnancy becomes known, he orders her burnt at the stake. She then sends him back his seal and cord to show him that it was he who impregnated her. This biblical narrative is possibly a sophisticated spoof of the biased sex laws of the Ancient Near East: Men may engage with impunity in sexual encounters with women to whom they are not married, but women may not do the same with men to whom they are (apparently) not married. Tamar has clearly outsmarted Judah tactically, and he praises her for her clever and resolute action. In the Talmud account, R. Hiyya bar Ashi’s wife outsmarts him tactically,<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">A standard Talmudic technique is to use a smart woman to shame a silly man. See my chapter, “Images of Women in the Talmud,” in <i>Religion and Sexism</i>, ed. Rosemary Ruether (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974), 202–203.</i> but he never regains equanimity after having his hypocrisy exposed. The fact that women test men in these two episodes does not suggest that women, in general, are temptresses. In each of these cases a woman chastises a man for unethical behavior: Judah, in that he let Tamar languish, and R. Hiyya, in that he denied his wife sexual satisfaction."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.55","I also suspect an element of male fantasy. Many men are likely to dream that a sexually exciting woman will appear from nowhere, take a fancy to them, and satisfy them in ways that they have not been satisfied before. In this story, the shame at being caught in the realization of such a fantasy, even though, ironically, the prostitute was none other than his own wife, consumed this man to such an extent that he ultimately died. In another well-known Talmudic anecdote, a man who paid a prostitute her steep fee in advance, changes his mind about securing her services at the last moment, when already in bed with her. She is so impressed with his selfrestraint that she follows him back to the land of Israel, converts to Judaism, and marries him (BT Menahot 44a). It is hard to imagine a better example of male sexual wish fulfillment."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.56","Having completed its discussion of the first part of M 4:12, the Gemara now cites the second part, on the subject of a man and his female relatives, and proceeds to discuss it."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.57","This section of Talmud bears out what we saw above: There is a wide range of views on the subject of being alone with one’s female relatives. These are the women with whom a man was likely to find himself alone and, therefore, the women by whom he would be sexually aroused. The many views on this topic and the plethora of anecdotes—not all cited here—lead me to believe, as stated above, that sexual arousal by female relatives was a controversial and real issue for the rabbis."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.58",The Talmud then defines the <i>mishnah</i>’s statement that a child who matures physically may no longer sleep in bodily contact with a parent of the opposite sex.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.59",The discussion of sexual arousal by female relatives ends with an anecdote:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.60","We see here an amoraic move away from the permission the <i>mishnah</i> gives to sleep in the same bed as young female relatives. R. Aha b. Abba’s action is permitted by the <i>mishnah</i><sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">I am assuming that this permission extends to young granddaughters, too.</i> if we assume that his granddaughter had not yet matured physically, and yet it deeply disturbs her father, R. Hisda. R. Hisda, in fact, expresses this concern elsewhere, saying that a man is no longer allowed to sleep in physical contact with his daughter once she reaches three years and one day.<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">R. Hisda’s statement is in BT Berakhot 24a: “If his children were still small, it is permitted [to recite Shema in bed with them naked, without a tallit separating them].<br>= =“Until what age?<br>– –“Said R. Hisda: a girl, until three years and a day and a boy until nine years and a day.<br>– –“Some say: a girl, eleven years and a day and a boy, twelve years and a day.” See also the section “Sex with a Minor,” in Chapter 4.</i> He politely criticizes his father-in-law but to no avail. The parallel discussion in the Yerushalmi (later in this chapter) similarly lowers the age of children sleeping with parents naked."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.61","When read independently of context, this anecdote seems to say that someone accused of inappropriate behavior can gamely deflect all charges against him by finding a reasonably relevant tradition or text. The old rabbi has the last word, and also, it would seem, his granddaughter in bed with him. But when read in context, it makes the almost frightening point that the grandfather is sexually exploiting or abusing the little granddaughter, using her to “warm himself up,” as did Abishag the Shunamite for King David in his old age (1 Kings 1:1–4). R. Hisda—who says elsewhere that he prefers daughters to sons (BT BB 141a), and he had both—is agitated, it seems, and rightfully so. It is hard to say whether the narrator sides with R. Hisda or not. He appears to be portraying the grandfather in negative terms, but one cannot be sure. It would seem, however, that with the passage of time the need arose to restrict the <i>mishnah</i>, to lower the age of permitting children and parents to sleep in the same bed naked. Since the discussion of family sleeping habits ends with this anecdote, the narrator seems to endorse restricting the <i>mishnah</i>, which would mean he agrees with R. Hisda and disapproves of the father-in-law’s behavior."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.62","The disagreement here and elsewhere about the age at which a young person’s body can create involuntary arousal, with a total of four different views expressed, again suggests that the rabbis were actively dealing with the subject. The <i>mishnah</i>, in its simple presentation, considers puberty to be the limit. But the rabbis in Babylonia and Palestine, with the exception of one anonymous view, lower it. This legal change probably reflects a shift in social standards, a move from a more relaxed attitude about nakedness and physical contact to a less relaxed one. This redefinition can also be seen, certainly in terms of results and maybe even in terms of intention, as an attempt to legislate protection for children—for girls from grown men and also for boys from grown women."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.63",The Yerushalmi commentary on this <i>mishnah</i> is much more limited than that of the Bavli.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.64","This same statement appeared in the Bavli in the name of R. Judah, who said it in the name of Rav. Although it is similar to the Tosefta’s statement that she may not be alone even with one hundred pagans, it is different in that it refers to Jewish men who, like the stereotypical pagan,<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">MAZ 2:1, 2.</i> are promiscuous and know no shame."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.65","Like the Bavli, the Yerushalmi cites the <i>baraita</i> in which Abba Saul and the Sages disagree about whether two women and one man may bury an infant, as well as the comment that one need not fear sexual arousal in a cemetery. It then talks about sexual arousal within the family unit."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.66","In this passage the Yerushalmi presents views like those in the Bavli but at variance with those in the Mishnah and Tosefta. The Mishnah stated that a man may be alone with his mother and daughter and, we may surmise, live with them. By implication, the <i>mishnah</i> forbids him to seclude himself with other female relatives. The Yerushalmi, however, comments that he <i>may</i> spend time alone with a sister, although he may not live with her. This rule is more lenient than the Mishnah and Tosefta, which explicitly forbade even being alone with a sister. The Yerushalmi then restricts a father to sleeping in physical contact with his daughter until she reaches the age of three, and a mother with her son until he is nine, even though the simple meaning of “<i>higdilu</i>,” as used in the Mishnah, is puberty. This is an example of an amoraic stringency, found in both the Bavli and Yerushalmi. As already noted several times, the appearance of this topic in both Talmuds, as well as in the Mishnah and Tosefta with variations in each of these major rabbinic works, creates the impression that it was very much a live issue at the time."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.67","Before I summarize all these materials, it should be noted that throughout this entire discussion, beginning with the Mishnah and ending with the Yerushalmi, the matter of sexual arousal is looked at from a man’s perspective only. It is men who find themselves sexually aroused when seeing or being with women. Whether there is reciprocal arousal on the part of women is not openly considered."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.68","The message of this extended Talmudic discussion is that men and women were not allowed, in contemporary parlance, to develop friendships, enter into social contact with each other, or engage in exchange of ideas because men are understood, first, to be sexually aroused just by the sight of a woman and, second, to be unable to hold themselves back from seeking release. The men most criticized are those who place themselves above others, claiming that they are able to withstand temptation. The only successful strategy is to avoid putting oneself at risk, and that means to avoid the company of women."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.69","Note that this material does not imply that men fall prey to their sexual urges because women deliberately excite them. I find it important to dwell on this point because one can all too easily make the woman the culprit in these situations, in that she entices him to sin. That is precisely what many have written about the rabbinic perception of women, as we have noted.<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">See the views cited in the opening paragraphs of this chapter.</i> But I think that this extensive commentary makes it clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that, according to the Gemara, women do not seek to snare men, but rather men, in the presence of women, lose control of themselves, even or especially if they are generally pious rabbis, and even if the women are close relatives. Taking the attitudes of someone like Ben Sira or Philo, who describe women as deliberately trying to entrap men, and reading their misogyny into this text would be incorrect.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Amy-Jill Levine, Introduction, <i>“Women like This”: New Perspectives on Jewish Women in the Greco-Roman World</i>, ed. Amy-Jill Levine (Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars Press, 1991), 22. Levine writes that Ben Sira’s belief about the indiscriminate sexuality of women is typical of men in Mediterranean culture. See also Judith Wegner’s “Philo’s Portrayal of Women—Hebraic or Hellenic?” in the same volume.</i> Rabbinic patriarchy had common features with the other patriarchal cultures of the times, but it was not necessarily identical to them."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.70","I also do not think that these texts portray men as sexual predators. These passages reflect the rabbis’ attitude toward human nature: It is good when restrained. It should also be noted that the outcome of separation is beneficial not only to men but also to women. To the extent that in the ancient patriarchal world women are socially and physically more vulnerable than men, they would, if these rules became normative, find themselves less harassed. Of course, separation from men also disadvantaged women by limiting their opportunities for active participation in so many matters that affected them."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.71","We find earlier in Kiddushin, 39b–40a, a set of three anecdotes that portray men very differently from the way they are portrayed above. In all three stories, a woman called a <i>matrona</i>, suggesting perhaps that she is a non-Jewish woman of the aristocracy, summons a man to engage in sexual relations with her. In all three cases, the men successfully resist her advances, one preferring to attempt suicide rather than succumb. He is saved by Elijah."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.72","The context of these stories is being rewarded, even with a miracle, for keeping the mitzvot of the Torah. Unlike the men in the other set of stories, who cannot resist temptation, these men actively attempt to extricate themselves from the sexual situation in which they find themselves, even at serious risk to their lives. As a reward, they are saved from the <i>matrona</i>’s overtures and, in the last case, also from the poverty that had initially placed the man at risk."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.73","How can one reconcile these stories with the others? The <i>mishnah</i> in chapter 1 of Kiddushin talks about people who do good deeds and receive rewards for them, and the associated <i>gemara</i> brings the above set of stories in which men are portrayed as morally strong. The <i>mishnah</i> in chapter 4 of Kiddushin talks about men who should not be alone with women, implying that men cannot control their libido, and the <i>gemara</i> brings stories about men who succumbed to sexual temptation. Where, then, does the truth lie? Are men weak or strong in resisting sexual temptation? It seems to me that the <i>mishnah</i> that addresses the topic of relationships between the sexes, and its associated commentary, is the material to which we should turn for the rabbis’ perception of men. The other set of passages describes unusual, heroic men. They are not to be confused with the majority."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.74",<b>Attitudes to Sexual Sin</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.75","This source, which does not address relationships between men and women in a direct fashion, as does Kiddushin chapter 4, but is instead providing moral preaching at the end of a tractate, incidentally reveals social and psychological truths. Misappropriating the property of others and having sexual relations with the women forbidden to a man by the Torah are tempting acts because they speak to his deepest instincts. These are the activities that a man craves. The term <i>meHaMDatan</i> reminds us of the last of the ten commandments: “Do not lust <i>(lo taHMoD)</i> after a woman … or any [other] property belonging to someone else” (Exodus 20:17). Although rewards are usually given for actions that we take, in this case, simply not yielding to the ever-present desire to commit these illicit acts is grounds for reward, according to this rabbi. This moralistic <i>mishnah</i>, I think, sums up the rabbis’ attitudes to relations between the sexes: No social relations between men and women are possible because men are preoccupied with sex. A man who seeks the companionship of women will merely be putting himself in a trying situation."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.76","This passage accords well with the statements in Pirkei Avot and BT Nedarim, quoted in the discussion of the <i>Sotah</i>, that men should not talk much with women because it leads, unavoidably, to forbidden sexual liaisons. <i>Sihah</i>, which means banter or friendly chitchat, will lead to friendly feelings, which will lead, ultimately, to sexual activity. It seems to me that women’s exclusion from the study of Torah with men is not linked to their intellectual level or their educational background or their penchant for sin. Rather, in a sex-segregated society, permitting women to interact freely with men would surely lead to sexual intimacy.<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">As we see elsewhere (BT Ketubot 13a), speaking with a woman can serve as a euphemism for sexual relations with her. Still, in this case, the verb “to speak” seems to have been intended literally.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.77",Another telling text appears in the Tosefta.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.78","This statement, uttered incidentally in the context of a legal obligation, also gives us a sense of the social realities of the times. A woman was considered fair game if she did not have a man to protect her. Her behavior, modest or immodest, did not much matter. She would be gazed upon and would likely fall prey to sexual exploitation by men, regardless of her manner of dress, if she did not have a husband. It is not what is right or wrong that matters to men but what is possible and what is not, according to the rabbis here. Theirs is a rather pessimistic evaluation of men’s predispositions. Only the protective presence of another man, the woman’s husband, will stop men from acting on their base instincts. Note, also, the touch of irony: Despite the possible pitfalls involved—drawing the attention of other men—a husband expects his wife to dress up, to make herself as attractive as possible in order to maintain his sexual interest in her. This theme repeats itself in so many rabbinic texts that its general acceptance in those days is beyond question.<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">See, for example, BT Ta’anait 23b, the statement by Abba Hilkiah and the discussion between R. Mani and R. Yitzhak b. Elyashiv. See also “Self-examination and Sexual Relations” and “R. Akiva’s Intentional Leniencies,” in Chapter 7.</i> It seems to be a standard feature of a patriarchal culture: Those who are dependent on the patriarch must seek to please and satisfy him. Note the underlying message that the rabbis view marital sexual activity positively."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.79",<b>Men’s Perception of Women’s Sexuality</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.80",The parallel passage in the Tosefta elaborates on this behavior:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.81","These passages accuse a woman of immodest, even sexually provocative behavior, of deliberately trying to entice men to become sexually involved with her. But such a woman is portrayed as one who strays from the right path, who is not like most others. Considering her behavior egregious and calling for divorce imply that most women, in the opinion of the rabbis, do not behave in this way, despite their need for sexual satisfaction."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.82","The passage from the Tosefta is remarkable in that it creates a symmetry between men and women. Both of them can be accused of violating Jewish practice, “dat moshe v’yisrael,” although the <i>mishnah</i> calls it “dat moshe v’yehudit,” an older version of the same term. And each list of violations, for him and for her, involves sexual misbehavior. His is forcing her, by means of a vow, to share sexual intimacies with others, apparently in order to heighten his sexual pleasure or to deliberately avoid procreative sex.<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">It seems to me that having others taste her food is also a sexual reference. The common thread of most violations in the Tosefta is sexual. Lieberman (<i>Tosefta Ketubot</i>, 80) holds otherwise.</i> Hers, as already mentioned, is immodest dress and behavior, bordering on deliberate enticement.<sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Tosefta makes it clear that men and women alike can behave immodestly. When the Mishnah redacted this same <i>halakhah</i>, however, it did not call the men’s actions a violation of sexual norms, as it did women’s provocative behavior, but simply listed two out of three of these items, ruling that in such cases he must divorce her and pay the marriage settlement (M 7:5). That is, the Mishnah does not make the point that men, too, can violate “dat moshe v’yisrael” or “yehudit”: Even though it does not legally tolerate these same behaviors, it does not call them by the name that it calls women’s sexual immodesty. The Mishnah also redefines “dat moshe v’yehudit” for women, separating it into two types of behavior, with the first being a new category of unacceptable behavior: She deceives him regarding her performance of mitzvot that he relies on her to perform, when he has no way of knowing whether she did what was expected of her or not. The second is sexually provocative behavior, as already described by the Tosefta. This phrase is part of the ancient betrothal formula. It is appropriated by the Tannaim as a behavioral standard. See Chapter 5, note 23.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.83",Elsewhere the Mishnah talks about the sexual needs of the average woman:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.84","This passage says that if a man vows to deny his wife sexual activity for one week, according to Bet Hillel, or two, according to Bet Shammai, he must divorce her. This clear statement that women have conjugal rights in marriage indicates that the rabbis recognized that women too, and not just men, are desirous of sex."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.85",The mishnah goes on to prescribe conjugal frequency for men engaged in a variety of occupations.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.86","This passage is hard to understand. Were it not for men’s expending energy on the job, and sometimes having to leave home for a period of time, the <i>mishnah</i> suggests that they would be sexually obligated to their wives every single day. But the Bavli interprets part of this passage from the <i>mishnah</i> in a way that virtually empties it of meaning. Saying that this view is R. Eliezer’s only, as the <i>mishnah</i> itself states, the Bavli goes on to present the view of the Sages that a Torah scholar may leave his wife, <i>without</i> permission, for up to two or three years. The stories that follow, however, suggest that he will be sorry if he takes advantage of this leniency.<sup>51</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Shulamit Valler, <i>Women and Womanhood in the Babylonian Talmud</i> (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 1993), 56–80, for an analysis of this entire section. See the rest of her book for other examples of the discrepancies between prescriptive law and rabbinic decisions in specific cases.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.87","Although R. Rehumi had permission to stay away for long periods of time, his absence was still considered by the rabbis to be abusive of his wife. When he reached the point of not even going home for a brief stay over the holidays, he gave up his right to life. This anecdote is perhaps more sympathetic to women than almost any other found in the Talmud: Even though the majority of rabbis give a scholar permission to favor the study of Torah over affording his wife (or even himself) sexual gratification, he will pay with his life if he chooses to ignore her human needs. Although not formally obligated to engage her sexually for years at a time, he is encouraged to do so as a decent and sensitive human being. He is in control of her: Although he can leave her to study and either come back or not, she has to stay at home. When in this dominant position, says Rava, he had better not forget about her or favor Torah study over her company.<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Boyarin’s analysis of this episode, <i>Carnal Israel</i>, 146ff. See also Yonah Frankel, Iyyunim Be-olamo Ha-ruhani Shel Sippur Ha-aggadah (Tel Aviv, 1981), pp. 99–115.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.88","What is the difference, then, between men’s and women’s sexual nature and behavior in these rabbinic portrayals? The argument from silence is that women, in general, are <i>not</i> easily aroused by looking at men or being in their company; the sources indicate men <i>are</i> easily aroused by looking at women or being in their company. A woman will not, according to the rabbis, find herself involuntarily drawn to sexual transgression and fail to stop herself from seeking gratification. Women, as Samuel says (BT Ketubot 64b), keep their sexual urges within themselves, whereas men cannot contain them. All of the cited material indicates that only the unusual woman solicits a man for a sexual encounter. One should not assume that the rabbis thought that women lacked libido, however, simply because they did not imagine most women actively seeking sexual gratification. Women are, indeed, understood to possess libido, but given their subordination to men, they are not allowed the freedom to exercise it. In a patriarchal society, men could satisfy themselves as they saw fit, but women, whom they controlled and over whom they had a sexual monopoly, could not. That is, what may in fact be biological differences between men and women are aggravated by men’s control over women. Note that these are men’s views about what women want and how they behave; they do not, necessarily, reflect rabbinic reality."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.89",<b>Conclusions</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.90","The sources we have considered were written by men and for men. They make a very simple point: Seeing and being with women arouses men sexually. Often, the woman who arouses a man is forbidden to him. Since his arousal demands resolution, it is better for him not to put himself in circumstances in which arousal is likely. To that end, he should not spend time talking to women or being alone with them, even female members of his own family. This last category, which includes mothers, sisters, and daughters, leads the reader to believe that the Mishnah speaks of involuntary sexual arousal. It is hard to imagine, even in circumstances very different from our own, that a normal man would solicit his mother or daughter for sexual activity or that she would solicit him. We should also note that the effect of separation in a patriarchal social configuration was to protect women and children from sexual exploitation."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.91","Nowhere have we seen a sense of women, in general, as responsible, through deliberate actions that they took, of tempting men to sin. It is only individual women about whom such reports appear. But note that it is men, in general, who succumb to sexual arousal with ease. This conclusion challenges those scholars who picture women as temptresses; they reach their conclusion by weaving together scattered aggadic passages, not by reading key halakhic passages in context."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.92","Women’s sexual arousal does not receive much commentary, although women’s right to sexual gratification is dealt with extensively. The rabbis understood that women have sexual needs, dependent for satisfaction on the men who marry and control them. Recognizing the power that a husband has over his subordinate wife, the rabbis spell out in detail his obligations to her, above and beyond sex for the sake of procreation. There is no frequency of obligation on her part to him, most likely because initiating sexual activity was considered his prerogative. Even if she was also an initiator, his sexual rights did not need the same kind of protection that hers did."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.93","Although we see here an accepting attitude toward sex, with the passage of time and possibly under the influence of foreign ideas, we can trace a less accepting attitude toward sex creeping into the rabbinic mind, as evidenced by some of the later stories. However, even when we look at the texts that view sex favorably, we find them demanding very modest public behavior. The rabbis expected women to cover themselves when they went out in public. A woman who bared her head or her arm was considered to be engaging in sexually provocative behavior, as was a woman who conversed freely with men, or who, in an even more extreme case, sported with them in the public baths."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.94","And, finally, the linkage of sex and Torah came up once again: Sex is seen as a distracting force from Torah study, and conversely, Torah study is seen as a means of taking one’s mind off sexual impulses. All these sources lead to the conclusion that the rabbis, like ordinary men, were engaged in a continuous battle with their libido. They were hoping that the intellectual and spiritual side of them would triumph over the physical. The material above does not lead us to think that they fully accomplished this goal."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Relations Between the Sexes.95",<b>Notes</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.1","S<small>INCE MOST ANCIENT SOCIETIES</small> were patriarchal in structure, it is not surprising to discover that rabbinic society was patriarchal as well. In the rabbinic conception of marriage, a man took a woman to be his wife and could dismiss her at will. He managed all the finances and could, if he wished, cancel, or annul, her vows and even bar her from talking to other men or going out of the house."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.2","But throughout the rabbinic period changes were taking place. By the time it ended, women had acquired many more rights. They occupied a new status, one closer to men’s. Although in certain areas they were more equal to men and in others less, in no marital area were women treated merely as chattel or fully as equal.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">Judith Wegner (<i>Chattel or Person?</i> [New York: Oxford University Press, 1988], 19) maintains that women are treated as chattel with respect to any matter affecting a man’s proprietary interest in their sexuality or reproductive abilities and as person with respect to all others. However, the details do not tally with this theory. For example, in sexual areas she was not chattel, since she had conjugal rights (see Chapter 2); in civil areas she was not equal, because as long as she was married to him she had no right to dispose of any of her property (M Ketubot 8:1).</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.3","Nearly every one of the biblical institutions relating to marriage was maintained by the rabbis but radically transformed. It is impossible to know if these transformations were the consequence of rabbinic invention or the infiltration of new ideas from other cultures. Or maybe they were the formal record of what had already been established generations earlier. Whatever the case may be, we find in the rabbinic materials a wholehearted endorsement of these changes and, possibly even more important, justification of these changes by means of legal arguments or scriptural interpretation."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.4","The main change we shall observe is that marriage evolved over time from the purchase of a woman from her father to a kind of “social contract” entered into by a man and a woman, albeit with him dominant and her subordinate. The critical difference between her old status in marriage as chattel-like and her new status as “second-class citizen” is that she acquired, in exchange for sexual and other service to her husband, a wide array of rights and protections."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.5",<b>The Framework of Jewish Marriage</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.6","The first topic we will examine is the marriage document, or <i>ketubah</i>. Some have called it one of the most progressive pieces of rabbinic legislation.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">Jacob Neusner, <i>Judaism: The Evidence of the Mishnah</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), 191.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.7","The principal provision of the <i>ketubah</i> is that the husband or his estate will pay a stipulated amount of money to the wife upon dissolution of the marriage by death or divorce. She will be allowed no other claims on him or his estate. In Roman marriage, an institution familiar to the rabbis, a woman did not receive this type of payment. Rather, a wife whose Roman marriage was dissolved retrieved only the dowry that she brought into it.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Susan Treggiari, <i>Roman Marriage</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 323ff.</i> Unlike the husband of the rabbinic marriage, who was required to pay out of his pocket the amount he promised in the <i>ketubah</i>, the husband in a Roman marriage made no additional payments from his own resources. Mishnah Ketubot opens with a discussion of the statutory amount of the marriage settlement."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.8","The difference in “price” between the virgin and the previously married woman, which appears throughout the legislation about marital matters, is not explained or derived from verses but presented as a given. A premium on a virgin was commonplace in the ancient world and continues today in many places. It tells us that one way of looking at marriage is the acquisition of a woman by a man for the purpose of sexual gratification. The rules reflect a male perspective: He is most pleased if the woman he acquires for himself has not previously known, in a sexual sense, any other man. He will be the first. Making the amount of the marriage settlement vary so significantly with the presence or absence of virginity says, in very clear terms, that her sexual status is a major factor in his choice of a wife. Elsewhere we learn that her lineage also matters.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Chapter 4 of M Kiddushin deals extensively with investigating a prospective wife’s lineage.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.9","This opening <i>mishnah</i> of tractate Ketubot sets the stage for the discussion of marriage. Other <i>mishnah</i>s later in the tractate address various aspects of the marital relationship. Beyond making herself available to him sexually, the wife is expected to perform the basic household tasks."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.10","The passage goes on to allow her to assign these jobs to others, as long as she makes sure that they are fulfilled."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.11",As for his obligations to her:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.12",Notice that his financial outlay for support and other payments is offset by his right to the usufruct of her assets and to any other moneys that she earns or anything she finds.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.13","All these rules describe a situation in which she enters his home, provides a wide variety of service to him, has all her needs met by him, and is even promised a lump sum payment by him upon dissolution of the marriage. But the arrangement is rather uneven: He controls her time, her activities, and her money; she does not control his. For this reason she, but not he, needs a guarantee of basic rights. The general social construction of Jewish marriage in the Bible and Talmud is, thus, sexist in the extreme. This is not surprising for the ancient world. What is surprising, however, are the rules the Mishnah institutes to modify this state of affairs. As we examine selected passages on marriage, we will see in each case how its sexist bias was altered but not eradicated."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.14",<b>The Marriage Contract: From Bride-Price to Ketubah</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.15","The changes that took place in the payments associated with marriage are probably the best indication of an evolving rabbinic perception of the nature of marriage. The following derivation, although rather intricate, makes a simple point: The <i>ketubah</i> is based on Scripture. The verses about rape and seduction that will be cited are the only legal passages in the Pentateuch that make explicit reference to the exchange of marital moneys."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.16","According to the first view expressed in this passage, the words “the bride-price of virgins,” that is, the fifty silver shekels that the husband paid to the father of the bride (Deuteronomy 22:29) in normal circumstances, not just following rape or seduction, imply the establishment of the <i>ketubah</i>. But the <i>ketubah</i> is not a bride-price. On the contrary, the differences between the two are so great that it is at first hard to understand how anyone could see those words as the scriptural basis for the <i>ketubah</i>. The bride-price of virgins is paid to the father by the husband at the time of marriage, whereas the <i>ketubah</i> is paid to the woman herself, upon the dissolution of the marriage by death or divorce. That is, it is paid at the end, not at the beginning; it is paid to her, not to her father. Therefore, one can only argue that the <i>ketubah</i> is Torah mandated in the broad sense of a marriage payment. The following passages clarify this matter by pinpointing the “historical” reasons for this change."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.17","This <i>mishnah</i>, and even more so the <i>baraita</i> that follows, imply that it used to be the case that a man could acquire a wife by putting her <i>ketubah</i> moneys on the table, that is, paying for her in advance. But this practice was later outlawed. Instead, the man had to create a lien on all of his assets and make them responsible for the payment of the <i>ketubah</i>. Should he die leaving insufficient funds for the payment of the <i>ketubah</i>, she could seize properties purchased from him by others after he married her. She was first creditor on his estate."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.18",The Gemara gives a fuller account of this transformation.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.19","This text is hard to understand. First, what is the relationship between the statement of R. Judah—the Amora, not the Tanna—and the older passage, the <i>baraita</i>, that follows? They seem to be saying the same thing in the same words. Why would an Amora repeat verbatim the first and last clause of a <i>baraita</i>? Second, and even more serious, parts of the <i>baraita</i> make no sense."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.20","R. Judah says that men did not marry because they could not afford to put either 200 or 100 zuz on the table at the outset of the marriage. At that early period in their lives they were not in a position to make such a large outlay of cash to the father of the bride. The <i>baraita</i> begins by repeating the first part of R. Judah’s statement verbatim. It continues and says that they would put the <i>ketubah</i> in her father’s home in order to solve the problem. How the new location solves the problem of a young man’s inability to give up such large sums in cash is not at all clear. However, if we overlook this difficulty, we see that this “solution” created a new problem: It made divorce too easy. Since no financial outlay was required for divorce, if a groom lost his temper, he could simply ask his bride to leave. Therefore, to promote the stability of marriage, the rabbis decreed that the <i>ketubah</i> be placed in the marital home, that of the groom’s father, where the bride could then turn the moneys into silver or gold or brass utensils. But since divorce still required no financial outlay, the groom could easily dismiss her along with the utensils that she had fashioned from the money."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.21","Marriage was stabilized only with the advent of Simon b. Shetah, who arranged for the groom not to lay out the money in advance, upon taking a wife, but to defer payment until the dissolution of the marriage. This deferral solved two problems at once: one, young men’s inability to part with large sums of cash at the time of marriage; second, men’s impulsive divorce of their wives. Not only did Simon b. Shetah’s solution encourage a man to marry, but it also discouraged him from divorce, which became too costly: He would have to liquidate assets in order to pay the marriage settlement. Since the husband could no longer simply send his wife out with the <i>ketubah</i> utensils in hand, many a marriage could be saved. By the time the husband was able to raise the money that he needed to pay her settlement, he had calmed down and come to the realization that he did not want to divorce her."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.22","According to this source, the monetary arrangements in effect before the time of Simon b. Shetah were akin to the bride-price of the Bible, money paid up front. Simon b. Shetah transformed marital moneys owed by the husband from a prepayment into a deferred payment, thereby creating the <i>ketubah</i> as we know it. We thus find that both the Sages and R. Simon b. Gamliel, mentioned earlier, are right: The origin of the <i>ketubah</i> as we know it is both biblical and rabbinic."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.23","The above <i>baraita</i>, which, as we noted, seems illogical, is actually the conflation of two distinct sources—the preceding amoraic statement by R. Judah, which looks at the change from a male perspective, and Simon b. Shetah’s rather radical change in practice, which looks at the issue from a woman’s perspective or at least from the point of view that women, in general, do not want to be summarily dismissed by their husbands. R. Judah read the tannaitic source, which also appears in slightly different form in both the Tosefta and the PT:<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">T Ketubot 12:1; PT 8:11; Ketubot 32b, c.</i> Those passages talk about the need to stabilize marriage to benefit women but make no reference to men’s hardships at that period of time. R. Judah added that, in his opinion, this change benefited men too by putting marriage within the reach of most of them, rich or poor. Over the course of time, his statement, which appeared in the Bavli text right before the <i>baraita</i> because it was based on it, was assimilated by the <i>baraita</i>, probably because the two statements were, in many ways, similar. As a result, the <i>baraita</i> became hard to understand and his statement became superfluous.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">See my book <i>Development of the Talmudic Sugya</i>, 146–157. The early commentators on the Talmud solve all of these difficulties but in ways that seem more forced.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.24","The image of men in this <i>baraita</i> is not flattering. A husband’s decision to divorce did not follow a lengthy period of introspection and deliberation but was based on a whim: For some reason, most likely slight, he grew angry with his wife and decided to send her away. Only later did he realize that his hasty actions would hurt him as well as her. In fact, this image of impulsivity reappears in many different places in the Talmud, in particular with respect to <i>kohanim</i>, who, if they divorce a wife in a fit of pique, are not allowed to take her back.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">BT BB 160b.</i> The Talmud makes the standard assumption that one cannot trust men to act rationally when embroiled with their wives over some matter, large or small. When Bet Hillel says, at the end of Mishnah Gittin, that a man is within his rights to divorce his wife even if the only unseemly thing she did was burn the food (M Gittin 9:10), they are probably making reference to this same emotional instability.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">Treggiari (<i>Roman Marriage</i>, 440) makes similar comments about Roman husbands who uttered the divorce formula in the heat of the moment and then regretted it.</i> R. Judah, by explaining the transformation of the <i>ketubah</i> from prepayment to deferred payment in terms of men’s financial straits and not their hot-headedness, as does the <i>baraita</i>, redeems their image."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.25","This transformation of the <i>ketubah</i> from bride-price to marriage settlement benefits women. Although the price structure did not change—virgins were still valued more than nonvirgins—the woman was paid the money directly, at a time when she needed it, in between marriages or facing years to come as a widow. In addition, she may have benefited from the obstacles that paying this money placed in the way of a quick and easy divorce. Couples in marital trouble may have remained together because of the difficulties of getting divorced."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.26","The question now arises: Once the <i>ketubah</i> was transformed into a terminal payment, a way of providing a woman with some assets to tide her over into her next marriage, then why was the <i>ketubah</i> of a virgin twice the amount of the <i>ketubah</i> of a previously married woman or nonvirgin? The <i>ketubah</i>, as a deferred payment, was no longer a gauge of her sexual intactness."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.27","The distinction seems to be a carryover from the bride-price era. It was not discarded because the notion that “unused” women are worth more and are more desirable than “used” women still resonated deeply within the (male) population. If nothing else, this distinction was an incentive to women to remain virgin, in anticipation of an easier “retirement” at the end of marriage. But it is also true that this distinction paled in significance once the rabbis had instituted a voluntary payment called “<i>tosefet ketubah</i>,” additional moneys written into the <i>ketubah</i>, to be paid upon dissolution of the marriage. These did not vary with a woman’s sexual history. As M Ketubot 5:1 states, “If he wishes to obligate himself to an additional 10,000 zuz, he could do so.” It would seem, then, that the <i>ketubah</i> monetary stipulations varied with the economic status of the husband and did not reflect, for the most part, the virginal or nonvirginal state of the bride. So, although the 200 and 100 zuz payments appear frequently in rabbinic literature and suggest that virgins were treated differently from nonvirgins, those sums were only a starting point, not the actual price agreed on. The difference between virgins and nonvirgins thus appears to have lost much of its financial significance no later than the time of the Mishnah.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">The standard <i>ketubah</i> in use today requires that the groom stipulate an amount to be added to the basic 200 or 100 zuz.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.28","What we have seen so far does not yet qualify the <i>ketubah</i> as one of the “most progressive pieces of rabbinic legislation,” even though the document, as it was written then and as it is still written today, does enable her to collect a stipulated amount from his estate and receive her dowry intact upon dissolution of the marriage. We must also look at other rules associated with the <i>ketubah</i> that were not necessarily included in writing but were obligatory nonetheless. They are called “stipulations of the court” [<span dir=""rtl"">תנאי בית דין</span>] because they could be upheld in a court of law. It is the combined set of written and unwritten benefits that allows the <i>ketubah</i> to be properly considered a landmark document."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.29",The additional stipulated benefits are as follows:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.30","If she is taken captive, he will redeem her and take her back as his wife, even if she was raped in captivity. This rule does not hold for the wife of a <i>kohen</i>, who promises only that he will return her to her home, not that he will resume his marital relationship with her.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">M Ketubot 2:9. The rabbis interpret the “<i>zonah</i>” of Lev. 21:7 as a woman who had sex with a man forbidden to her.</i> A <i>kohen</i>, according to the rabbis, may not live with a wife who had sex with someone else while married to the <i>kohen</i>, even if the sex was not consensual (M Ketubot 4:8)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.31","If she falls ill, he must provide her with medical care (M 4:9)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.32","If she predeceases her husband, her sons—and not his sons from other wives—inherit the <i>ketubah</i> money that her husband never had to pay out to her, as well as her dowry (M 4:10)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.33","If she outlives her husband, her daughters will be able to continue to live in the same house and receive support from his estate until they marry (M 4:11)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.34","If she outlives her husband, she has the right to remain in his house and maintain herself from his assets for as long as she lives there (M 4:12)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.35","In a sense, this is a complete insurance policy. She will be provided for if catastrophe strikes during the marriage. She will be provided for after she is widowed. Her children will be provided for after the death of her husband: Her sons will inherit his estate as well as hers and her daughters will be maintained by it."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.36","Having reviewed these laws, we must now ask again: What does the <i>ketubah</i> tell us about social structures? We learn from it that a married woman is dependent upon her husband and needs to have her rights protected. No <i>ketubah</i> is written for him, not because he had fewer rights, but because he had, in the past, <i>all</i> the rights and resources. He alone makes promises to her, whereas she makes none to him. So even though the <i>ketubah</i> guaranteed many rights that women would not have had otherwise, still, the married woman’s need to have a <i>ketubah</i> drawn up for her indicated, very clearly, that she was under her husband’s thumb: He controlled all the financial assets of the family and could dole them out to her as he saw fit."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.37","We thus see that as enlightened a document as the <i>ketubah</i> is, it was necessary only because the society in which women lived and the laws that that society developed were patriarchal. Since the <i>ketubah</i> consolidates some basic rights for women, even though it leaves patriarchy in place, it was an improvement over what was the case prior to the time it was instituted, the bride-price. But this transformation of the bride-price into the <i>ketubah</i> benefited women not only for the reasons stated in the <i>baraita</i>. By deferring the <i>ketubah</i> payment to the end of the marriage, the nature of marriage could no longer be described as the purchase of a bride from her father. As long as the bride-price was paid at the outset, marriage had to be looked upon as a purchase. But from the time that the <i>ketubah</i> was paid at the end, the arrangements at the beginning of the marriage are more correctly termed negotiation rather than purchase. I think the importance of this paradigm shift for women cannot be overestimated. The patriarchal construction of marriage, although certainly not dismantled with the development of the <i>ketubah</i>, was significantly altered. Marriage became a relationship into which two people entered. Even though the man and woman were not on equal footing, they worked out the details between themselves, as we will now see."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.38",A look at betrothal procedures will provide further evidence of this trend toward greater women’s participation.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.39",<b>The Betrothal: From Purchase to “Social Contract”</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.40",Chapter 1 of Tractate Kiddushin opens with the basic rules of betrothal.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.41","This chapter deals with how a person/man buys various kinds of property, both animate and inanimate. The wife’s position at the head of the list indicates that she is the most important and precious kind of property, but property nonetheless. Moreover, the means listed for buying women are virtually identical to the means listed for acquiring other items. Note also that acquiring a woman by sexual intercourse is parallel to taking possession [<span dir=""rtl"">חזקה</span>] of a slave or field. That is, in this context, sex is something that he does to her to demonstrate that he owns her and wields power over her. Not an uncommon feminist observation in the contemporary world as well."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.42","But more subtle points are being made here. If we move beyond the remarkable similarities between buying women and buying fields, we see that there are equally remarkable differences. The amount paid for fields corresponds to their value, as does the amount paid for the other items listed. The amount paid for a woman may be minimal. It can be described in no way other than symbolic: The perutah and the dinar (zuz) are the smallest units of currency, the first in copper and the second in silver. These legal differences show that acquiring a woman may be identical <i>in form</i> to acquiring a variety of other objects, but it is not similar <i>in content</i>. The form of purchasing a woman has been maintained over time, even to this very day in traditional circles, but the essence of the transaction changed. Notice also that the money for betrothal, or the object worth money, such as a ring, is presented to the object of betrothal herself, the woman, who is the focus of the first <i>mishnah</i>, and not to a third party, as is the case with the purchase of a slave and as used to be the case with women."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.43","This first <i>mishnah</i> of the chapter, therefore, when it lines up betrothal with all the other salable items and the rules of how they are acquired, makes it look like a purchase. And that is what it used to be. But the difference in the rules for buying women and all other items indicates that acquiring a wife was no longer simply a purchase but a negotiated contract. According to this <i>mishnah</i>, marriage occupies a mediate place on the continuum: It is neither a purchase of chattel nor a relationship between equals. It is somewhere in the middle."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.44","The move away from marriage as a purchase is borne out by the <i>mishnah</i>’s terminology. The term <i>kinyan</i> (purchase) in relationship to marriage appears here and in several other places,<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">See, for instance, M Ketubot 1:6 and 7:7, where reference is made to a mistaken purchase <i>(mekah ta’ut)</i>. See also the <i>baraita</i> in BT Ta’anit 31a in which women use the term purchase <i>about themselves</i> when talking to men about marriage. See also T Yevamot 2:1, cited in the next section.</i> but it is superseded in most instances by the term <i>kiddushin</i>, the name of the tractate, the root of which is K-D-SH, meaning holy or set aside. Marriage is an arrangement in which a man sets aside a woman to be his wife. She does not set him aside to be her husband, for he may marry more than one woman. Despite this imbalance, the standard rabbinic term for betrothal, <i>kiddushin</i>, unlike its biblical equivalent, <i>erusin</i>,<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Erusin</i> and <i>kiddushin</i> are synonyms. Each refers to the first stage of marriage, called in English “betrothal.” This state can only be dissolved by divorce.</i> suggests that marriage has now been infused with a sense of sanctification."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.45","Chapters 2 and 3 of Kiddushin deal with standards for the betrothal formula and moneys, as well as stipulations that accompany the betrothal and the need for there to be no misunderstanding or deception on the part of either side as to what he or she is getting in a mate. If there is, the transaction is invalidated. The importance of these rules for our inquiry is that they affect the bride in the same way that they affect the groom, thus providing another indication of the changing nature of betrothal. The fourth and last chapter deals with lineage and the need for a groom to check a bride’s background before betrothing her. She need not check his, however."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.46",<b>Consent to the Betrothal</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.47",The Tosefta introduces yet another matter that supports the distinction between marriage and purchase.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.48","Implicit in a number of these statements is the notion that a woman’s consent is necessary for betrothal. That is, if she flings the betrothal moneys he presents to her into the ocean, she is making a clear statement that she is rejecting him. But if she accepts the tokens of betrothal, she indicates her consent. Similarly, if, when he offers her the betrothal object, she asks him to give it instead to a third party, that again indicates that she is turning him down. But if she asks him to give the object to someone who will accept it for her, then she indicates acceptance of his offer. Finally, if it takes time for him to transfer the full sum of the betrothal money to her, she may retract up until the moment that he hands her the last coin. This statement makes it almost explicit that a woman must consent to the betrothal for it to be valid. Any indication on her part that she refuses his proposal prevents the betrothal from taking effect. Consent, in all of these instances, is indirect."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.49","Elsewhere the Tosefta notes that betrothal takes effect—allows the groom to <i>purchase</i> the bride—only if both of them consent (T Yevamot 2:1).<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Hebrew text reads: <span dir=""rtl"">הקדושי׳ אינן קונין באשה אלא מדעת שניהם</span><span dir=""ltr"">.…</span></i> But a woman’s <i>consent</i> to be <i>purchased</i> in marriage makes little sense. It seems that the language of purchase, which was an accurate representation of the transaction in the Bible, has become standard terminology for marriage, even as the nature of the marital transaction was undergoing significant change. This supports the point made above that the Mishnah’s (1:1) occasional use of the verb K-N-H, to purchase, in describing betrothal, does not necessarily imply that the substance of the transaction tallied with its descriptive term.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Tal Ilan (<i>Jewish Women in Greco-Roman Palestine</i> [Tübingen: J.C.B. Mohr, 1995], 88–89). David Weiss Halivni writes that the root K-N-H “is ill-suited for normal use in connection with regular marriage because of its predominant connotation of purchase” (“The Use of <span dir=""rtl"">קנה</span> in Connection with Marriage,” <i>Harvard Theological Review</i>, 1964, 244–248). He is referring to biblical usage, as well as rabbinic. I find his view problematic because the use of K-N-H in conjunction with marriage is only one reason, among many others, such as the use of the root L-K-H (to purchase) to describe marriage (see note 15, this chapter), that leads to the conclusion that marriage in ancient Israel was a purchase, albeit of a special kind (see the preceding section). See Y. N. Epstein, <i>Mevo’ot Lesifrut Hatannaim</i> (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1957), 52–53, who writes that a woman used to be bought, just like a slave.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.50","Direct negotiation with the woman herself is how most of the <i>mishnah</i>s and <i>baraita</i>s picture the betrothal. If we add to that the requirement that she give her consent, which would not have been the case if her father betrothed her, we see a move in the direction of transforming a betrothal from a purchase into a “social contract.” Note, however, that although the Tosefta, Bavli, and Yerushalmi all require that a woman consent to an offer of betrothal, the Mishnah does not. This may be evidence of a more conservative point of view of the redactor of the Mishnah, a stance he espoused in reference to other issues as well.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Chapter 8, “Disposition of a Mother’s Estate.” See also Chapter 5, “The World of Divorce According to R. Meir.”</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.51","The Bavli brings, in conjunction with its citation of a variation of one of the cited <i>baraita</i>s (T 2:8), a number of related amoraic questions, all with the purpose of establishing boundaries for consent. No one suggests that a woman be required to say aloud that she consents to the marriage, as is standard in most secular wedding ceremonies today. Rather, the rabbis discuss different ways in which consent can be demonstrated."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.52","In each of these cases the question that the rabbi must address is whether the woman’s response to the man’s proposal constitutes consent. In all three the decision is that it does not. She wanted what she wanted, but it was not marriage. The three stories give the impression that this exchange between him and her is innocent banter. We see a woman who is flirting with a man in the public domain—a market, a store, or a palm tree somewhere—and in response to his rather flippant betrothal offer, simply reiterates what she said in the first place. She is playing a game with him, as is he with her. She initiates the conversation in what appears to be a mildly provocative manner, he intensifies it with a betrothal offer, and she dodges the question in response. This is about as contemporary as a Talmudic anecdote can get. The rabbi in each case understands that this is not a proposal of marriage followed by an acceptance."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.53","All those decisions taken together, most of which rule that the woman’s response does not indicate consent, show that the Bavli sees betrothal as something that he offers to her, but to which she, either explicitly or implicitly, must give consent.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">The anonymous voice of the text upholds the requirement of consent in a lengthy discussion of related matters in BT Kiddushin 44a and also BT Yevamot 19b. The Yerushalmi (Yevamot 5:4; 7a) cites a <i>baraita</i> in which Rebbe says that betrothal can only be effected with consent.</i> These rulings narrow the definition of consent, clearly benefiting women. If she were thought to be consenting when she was not, she would need a <i>get</i> from, or be forced to live with, a man she did not want. I think that the requirement of consent puts to rest the concept of marriage as a purchase."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.54",<b>Women’s Initiation of Betrothal</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.55","Another development favoring women is the discussion of their initiation of and participation in the betrothal ceremony by giving the betrothal gift. To the extent that she plays a role in the betrothal process, she is functioning more as partner to her husband and less as subordinate. In this instance we will see change and development within the Talmudic period itself."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.56",The Tosefta restricts a woman from participating in any way in the betrothal ceremony.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.57","It is interesting that the Tosefta felt it necessary to raise the possibility of a woman’s initiating the betrothal procedure. By way of comparison, when discussing divorce, no one suggests that a woman write a bill of divorce for a man. It is, therefore, tempting to conclude that a woman betrothing a man was thinkable in the ancient, rabbinic world. I say this because the Bavli, in its commentary on this very <i>baraita</i>, explores this possibility (5b). At first, it rules out women’s participation, deciding that if a man issued the betrothal statement but a woman gave the betrothal gift, that there is “doubtful betrothal”: She is not his wife, but even so she may not become betrothed to someone else until this man writes her a bill of divorce. This implies that her participation may have had legal standing. A little later in the discussion, Rava, a prominent Amora, presents several unusual cases of betrothal with the participation of a third party. He brings his sequence to a climactic conclusion by asking about women who propose to men and actively participate in the betrothal proceedings."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.58","In two out of these three cases a woman initiated the betrothal ceremony and requested that a sum of money be given either by the groom to a third party or by a third party to the groom. We assume, in all of these instances, that the groom then recited the betrothal formula to her.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">Rashi understands this to be so, that the groom recites the formula. It is also possible to construct a case in which an explicit betrothal declaration is not necessary. See BT Kiddushin 6a.</i> Betrothals like these, in which either the woman does not receive betrothal money or the man does not give it, or both, are valid, says Rava. Weaving these cases together, he then asks:"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.59","Rava has constructed a remarkable set of cases. After establishing several legal principles in cases involving three people—the bride, the groom, and a third party—he collapses the three-person scenario into a two-person one, and asks what the law is in a case in which she makes the betrothal presentation to him. The answer flows logically from his previous statements: The betrothal is valid. Furthermore, he seems to have constructed his previous three statements for the express reason of arriving at the fourth—which goes beyond the first three—the initiation of betrothal and the presentation of betrothal moneys by a woman to a man. Given the skill with which Rava drafted the first three cases, Mar Zutra’s immediate response is unsurprising: In such a case, the betrothal is valid. But, in the following generation, R. Ashi voices an objection based on a technicality and Mar Zutra finds it necessary to restrict his position: A woman may initiate betrothal proceedings and make the betrothal gift only when the man in whom she is interested is a man of means, whose acceptance of her offer will give her pleasure worth a penny, which can then be considered the man’s betrothal gift to her."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.60","We thus see that the extent of women’s involvement in initiating and performing the betrothal ceremony expanded over time. First raised and rejected by the Tosefta, it becomes permissible, within limits, in the later amoraic period. Notice that the amoraic case is not just the offering of a betrothal gift by a woman to a man, but the initiation by her of a particular match. Did this reflect social realities of women proposing betrothal to men? That could very well be so, because we find several instances in tannaitic literature in which women choose husbands.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Ilan (<i>Jewish Women</i>, 80ff). See, for example, BT Ketubot 22a.</i> Note, also, the changing model of marriage. Although we began with women being married off by their fathers and then moved on to women needing to consent to the betrothal offer, we have now reached the opposite end of the continuum, women themselves initiating the betrothal and actively participating in it."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.61",<b>Conclusions</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.62","This selection of passages dealing with marriage shows us that there were, over time, significant changes in how it was contracted. The father recedes as a key player and the woman, who will be taken in marriage by the man, approaches center stage, becomes the focus of attention. Her consent is required; she may even initiate the betrothal discussions and present the groom with the betrothal moneys. Most important, the bride-price of virgins, which used to be paid in advance, was turned into a lien on the husband’s real assets and deferred to the time of dissolution of the marriage by death or divorce. That, probably more than any of the other changes, transformed marriage from a purchase of “chattel” into a negotiated relationship between a woman who is subordinate and a man who is dominant. Note that it is only she whose rights have to be guaranteed in a <i>ketubah</i>."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.63","This study is not intended to cover all aspects of marriage as presented in the Talmud. Instead, I have attempted to show, through selection of topics within the general category of marriage, that this institution was undergoing extensive, and perhaps radical, change in the rabbinic period. Although we cannot say that the change approximated treating women equally with men (which is probably the goal of much legislation within Jewish circles today, particularly in the area of marital law), the inescapable conclusion is that the general thrust of rabbinic legislation regarding marriage still seems to have intended to confer, or at least had the effect of conferring, more rights and benefits on women and on men at the same time. This is not a circumstance in which the more they give the woman, the more they deny the man, but rather one in which the more she gains, the more he gains."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Marriage.64",<b>Notes</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.1","S<small>EX CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN</small> is a topic of dispute between the sexes. Men rape and seduce women but, when charged, not only deny having committed the act but even doubt that there is such a thing as forced sex. Women invite sexual attention, men say, but if the women are not satisfied with the outcome, contend they were coerced."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.2","Even the Torah expresses skepticism about some claims of forced sex. Several passages in Deuteronomy (22:23–27) suggest that rape in a city is not possible, for if the victim cries out, she would be saved because her cries would be heard. Outside the city, rape is possible because a victim’s cries would not be heard. Should rape occur, punish the rapist but not the victim(!), because he is like one who murders by ambush, whereas she is blameless (v. 26). Since disbelief about these crimes persists to this very day, with special rules of rape corroboration only now being removed from the books in American and English law, we should note that such doubt is absent from the rabbis’ discussion of this matter. They understand the Torah’s city versus open country opposition metaphorically, distinguishing instead between those instances in which a woman objected but was overcome (“open country”) and those in which she did not object (“city”).<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Menahem Elon, <i>Jewish Law, History, Sources, and Principles</i> (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society [hereafter, JPS], 1994), 1030–1031, and his references to Philo, who lived in the first half of the first century, and to <i>Sifrei Devarim</i>, Ki Tetzei, sec. 243, ed. Finkelstein and Horowitz (273). See further discussion.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.3","The reason that the rape and seduction of an unbetrothed virgin—seduction being the act of enticing a woman to unlawful sexual intercourse without the use of force—are presented by the Bible as aspects of marital law is that the preferred resolution of these cases is marrying off the victim to the aggressor. This means that rape and seduction, according to the Bible, were primarily crimes against the young woman’s father, for he would lose the anticipated income from his daughter’s virginity. However, by arranging for the seducer or rapist to marry her and pay the father a bride-price for his now not-so-eligible daughter, the matter is fully resolved. Even so, the rabbis introduced far-reaching legislative change, transforming rape and seduction from crimes against a woman’s father into crimes against a young woman herself. The motivation for these changes, although not stated explicitly, is likely to be society’s altered perception of the status of women, the nature of marriage, and women’s role in negotiating it."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.4","By introducing the requirement that the victim consent to marriage with the rapist, the rabbis give her a measure of control over her own future. She can choose either to marry him or not to marry him. This means that rape or sex does not make a marriage, as it did in the Bible. The rabbis thus turn rape into a crime against women, with marriage no longer the only outcome, but one possible outcome. Similarly, by discussing women’s pain in rape, although mediating it through men’s eyes, the rabbis are saying that rape has consequences for women other than lowering their value on the marriage market and limiting their marital prospects."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.5","The issue of consent also underlies the passages that deal with sex with a minor. Since consent has virtually no meaning when speaking of sex between adults and children, it follows that all sex with a minor is forced. The rabbis discourage such activity, such as a father’s marrying off a young daughter, but still find it necessary to discuss the legal consequences of such acts. They go on to say that consent can only be given when one reaches intellectual maturity, not before. For this reason, they make a woman legally independent when she reaches physical and mental maturity <i>(bogeret)</i>. By creating this new category, the <i>bogeret</i>, the rabbis say in a very clear way that women may—and perhaps should—make their own decisions about marriage, that they have the power to choose with whom to live and with whom to engage in sex. This is a far cry from a woman’s being handed over in marriage by her father to her husband."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.6",<b>Rape and Seduction in the Torah</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.7","This set of verses is rather puzzling. In all cases of seduction, the seducer has to pay the bride-price of virgins to the father of the girl he seduced, but not in all cases will he get a bride. It depends on how her father feels about the match. If he refuses to give his daughter in marriage, he still deserves to be paid because, as a nonvirgin, she is worth less to him on the marriage market. That she was taken advantage of and shamed is not addressed. These verses suggest that a daughter is seen as the property of her father, almost as a part of him, so that it is he, not she, who suffers as a result of her exploitation. Or, more accurately, she does not suffer independently of him. The individual is not viewed so much as an individual but as a member of a family.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">We still hear today about traditional Middle Eastern families killing a young female member because her immodest sexual behavior “stained the family honor.”</i> The seducer must therefore make amends to the collective body, in particular to the head of the household, but not to the girl herself."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.8","We find a similar outlook and legal resolution of the related crime of rape, dealt with only in Deuteronomy."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.9","Here, too, the sexual crime that is committed against the daughter is analyzed in terms of its economic effect upon the father. He is paid fifty silver shekels, the equivalent of a bride-price.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Jeffrey Tigay (<i>JPS Torah Commentary, Deuteronomy</i>, 208) writes that the fifty shekels may represent a combination of an average bride-price and also punitive damages.</i> But in this instance the Torah also shows its concern for the young woman by assigning the rapist to her as a husband, for as long as he lives, with the stated rationale “because he forced her.” This phrase expresses sympathy for the young victim: She now has a husband for good who may not fabricate a reason to divorce her. But why would she find it acceptable to marry the rapist? It seems that a girl who was raped could not easily be married off, as we will see with Tamar. Since ancient expectations of marriage had more to do with financial and social security and the opportunity to raise children than a loving relationship, the girl who was raped might not look all that askance upon the prescribed union. In addition, the Torah seems to regard the marriage to his victim as a penalty for the rapist. She becomes an albatross around his neck; he must provide for her forever. So the Torah is punishing the rapist much more severely than it punished the seducer. Since his crime was worse, in that her consent was not sought, his punishment, long-term economic obligation to his victim, without any possibility of divorce, is greater."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.10","In a preceding verse (25), the Torah says that if a man raped a betrothed virgin, his penalty is death. But why such a vast difference between the two punishments—marriage for the rape of an unbetrothed young woman and a death penalty for the rape of a betrothed young woman? Her suffering is identical in both instances. This forces us to conclude that the rape of a woman who already belongs to a man is a far more serious breach of the social order than the rape of a woman not yet purchased in marriage. The purported victim of the rape of a betrothed young woman is her husband. His virgin bride-to-be has been violated; therefore, the rapist, like the adulterer, has to die.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Tigay (ibid., 207–208) writes that raping an engaged virgin is a capital crime because it is adulterous but raping an unengaged virgin is not a capital crime because it is not adulterous. This distinction is correct. However, since he offers no explanation as to <i>why</i> the rape of an unbetrothed virgin is viewed as a far less serious offense, even though the victim suffers in an identical manner, he conceals the sexist bias of these laws.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.11","It is even possible to argue that the Torah does not describe two different crimes against unbetrothed women, seduction in Exodus and rape in Deuteronomy, but only one, seduction. The author of the Temple Scroll, one of the Dead Sea documents, dating from sometime after 120 <small>B.C.E.</small>, cites the Torah’s “rape” verses from Deuteronomy almost verbatim but substitutes the verb “seduce” for “rape.”<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>The Temple Scroll</i>, ed. Yigael Yadin (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society/Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1977–1990), col. 66, ll. 8–11, pp. 209–210.</i> Since he prescribes for seduction the same punishments that the Torah prescribes for rape—forced marriage, no divorce, payment of fifty silver shekels to the father—he may be suggesting that he sees both sets of Torah verses as portraying only one crime, seduction. In his opinion, there is no such thing as rape, that is, nonconsensual sex on her part. With the appropriate blandishments, women succumb.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">Lawrence H. Schiffman, in “Laws Pertaining to Women in the <i>Temple Scroll”</i> (<i>The Dead Sea Scrolls: Forty Years of Research,”</i> ed. Devorah Dimant and U. Rappoport [Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1992]), compares rape and seduction in the Torah, the Temple Scroll, and tannaitic literature. He concludes that since the Temple Scroll does not mention a bride-price, only a fifty-silver-shekel payment to her father, the author of the scroll considers it a penalty, like the Tannaim who will later call it <i>kenas</i>, not a compensation to the father for the loss of his daughter’s virginity (224). The author, he says further, “seeks to restore the moral balance and order.” I am not convinced by his argument.<br>Moshe Weinfeld (<i>Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School</i>, [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972], 283–287) suggests that the Torah deals with only one case, seduction. The laws as they appear in Deuteronomy pay more attention to the victim of “rape” because the Deuteronomic author is more humanistic. He takes the seduction laws of Exodus and rewrites them according to his own outlook.<br>It seems to me that there is only one sex crime presented in the Bible: It is neither rape nor seduction, as we know them today, but something in between—part forced and part consensual. The Torah’s skepticism about rape, combined with its two different terms to describe the same act, lead me to believe that it recognizes the use of force by the man but also imputes some sexual interest to the woman.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.12","It is interesting that in the two famous rape cases in the Bible, that of Dinah by Shechem (Genesis 34) and Tamar by Amnon (2 Samuel 13), the resolution differs from the recommendations made by the verses in Deuteronomy. In both instances, the brother(s) of the rape victim, in a devious manner, kill the rapist (and his family, in the first instance). The reason for their intense anger, as stated in reference to both episodes, is that “such a thing is an abomination [<span dir=""rtl"">נבלה</span>], something not done in Israel” (Genesis 34:7; 2 Samuel 13:12). We thus see that no marriage took place, in either case, between victim and rapist. Note further that neither victim ever married. Following the rape, Tamar lived in her brother’s home for two years, in a state of severe depression (2 Samuel 13:20).<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Hebrew expression for depression is “<span dir=""rtl"">ותשב תמר</span>] <span dir=""rtl"">ושממה</span>].” No husband is ever reported for Dinah.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.13",<b>The Rabbinic Paradigm Shift: From Crime Against Father to Crime Against Daughter</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.14","Unlike the author of the Temple Scroll, the rabbis posit the existence of two different sex crimes against unbetrothed women, seduction and rape. They use a new Hebrew term for rape, <i>ones</i> [<span dir=""ltr"">אנס</span>],<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">The only time that this word appears in the Bible is in Esther 1:8, “no one was to be forced” [to drink], <span dir=""rtl"">והשתיה כדת</span>] <span dir=""rtl"">אין אנס</span>]. According to the NJPS translation, “No restrictions!”</i> and view all cases of forced sex as rape, without regard to where the act took place.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">The rabbis, utilizing the word <i>“moshi’a”</i> in v. 27, also require an innocent bystander to prevent the rape of a betrothed young woman, even if it means killing the man who is about to attack her (M Sanhedrin 8:7). The theory is let him die innocent rather than guilty. The penalty for the rape of a betrothed young woman is execution.</i> Even more important, they transform seduction and rape from mainly monetary crimes against the girl’s father to cases of assault and battery against the girl herself. In no instance is either the father or the victim herself forced to agree to marriage with the perpetrator of the crime. It follows that not only do the rabbis view girls as separate entities from their fathers, but as shown in earlier chapters, they no longer consider marriage a purchase, or, at least, they no longer think that such a purchase can be enacted through rape."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.15","In the first source above, a <i>mishnah</i>, the rabbis institute a new set of payments, shame and injury, for both rape and seduction, and also pain for rape, based on what the victim of the crime—<i>the woman</i>—suffered.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">Should one argue that the shame spoken of here is that suffered by her father, because the verb “to suffer shame” is in the masculine <span dir=""rtl"">מתבייש</span>, I would respond that this formulation is borrowed from M BK 8:1 where it refers to the victim, male or female. Furthermore, M Ketubot 6:1 and T BK 9:14, when speaking of an assault on a woman that was committed in private, or on a concealed part of her body, either by her husband or by others, assigns the shame payment to her (two-thirds) and part to her husband (one-third). This source makes it clear that, according to the rabbis, the primary one who suffers the shame is the victim. Cf. Judith Wegner, <i>Chattel or Person?</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988), 26 and n. 53.</i> Unlike the biblical fine of fifty shekels, which is fixed, these vary from case to case. This legal innovation represents considerable social progress. Rape is now dealt with as a case of assault and battery, compensation for which is documented elsewhere, in M Baba Kama 8:1.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">M BK 8:1 lists five payments for damages—loss of limb, pain, medical costs, unemployment, and shame. Here we find only injury, pain, and shame—because the other two, medical costs and unemployment, do not always apply to rape. However, if the woman suffered injuries in the course of the forced sex act, they do. Three of these payments derive from the Torah—loss of limb, medical costs, and unemployment—and the other two, pain and shame, are rabbinic in origin. It is remarkable that Maimonides, in <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, Hilchot Hovel Umaziq 1:7, deduces the payment for pain (in a general case of injury) from the phrase “because he forced her.” This means that Maimonides acknowledges that women suffer pain in rape. The Gemara derives the pain payment from a different verse. See BT BK 85a.</i> Although the <i>mishnah</i> in Baba Kama lists five different payments for standard cases of assault, only the three mentioned above apply routinely to seduction and rape."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.16","The second source, a <i>baraita</i>, is strikingly innovative: Despite explicit statements in the Torah to the contrary, no marriage between victim and aggressor is required, neither in a case of rape nor in a case of seduction. Not only the father, but <i>even the young victim</i> may refuse the match. In the associated Gemara (BT Ketubot 39b), the Amoraim struggle, after the fact, to base each one of these new rules on scriptural phrases, as does the above <i>baraita</i> in a rather cryptic manner. These belabored efforts underscore the fact that this set of rules was generated, not by the Torah, but by the rabbis, most likely out of their desire to right a wrong to women: In the Talmudic period, automatic marriage to a rapist or seducer was no longer considered an appropriate solution to a young girl’s predicament. No one presumed that he was the man she wanted to marry. It is hard to understand, however, why the Mishnah makes no reference to this rule of refusal. The Tosefta, where it originates, and the Bavli, which accepts it, appear to be more concerned with her psychological welfare than the Mishnah.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Yerushalmi does not mention the possibility of refusal by the girl herself.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.17",The Mishnah further explores forced marriage resulting from rape.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.18","This passage seems to be providing a rationale for the Torah’s forcing a raped woman to live with the man who raped her. The rabbis are saying that a man who takes advantage of a physically handicapped woman, who is more vulnerable to rape and less marriageable than others, is punished by having her “foisted” on him for the rest of his life, as repulsive as he finds her.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">The only women he is not forced to marry are those of inappropriate lineage (e.g., a <i>mamzeret</i>, born of an incestuous or adulterous union). The rabbis will not force a violation of their own marital rules, even in a case of rape. The Temple Scroll already states that a rapist can marry his victim only if she is fitting for him according to the law. It then lists a variety of forbidden consanguineous relationships.</i> Such a punishment may benefit the woman who was his victim in that it provides her with a husband. When her lack of virginity was added to her physical disability, finding herself a mate, in a patriarchal society, would have been difficult."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.19","We also see that marital suitability in this passage is viewed strictly from a male perspective: The more physically blemished she is, the less appealing she is to him and other men, the more important, therefore, for him to have to marry her. It is even possible to suggest that this passage is homiletical: It informs men that rape may give short-term pleasure, but warns them that the price they pay may be long-term suffering; no matter how unsuitable and unappealing she may be to him, he will have to live with her for the rest of his life. How attractive he is in her eyes and her opinion of him as a mate are of no relevance for this <i>mishnah</i>, however. It assumes that women, especially those whose marital prospects are limited, prefer any man to no man at all.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 for a further expansion of this idea.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.20",<b>From Fixed to Variable Fine</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.21","At first reading, these <i>mishnahs</i> surprise us: they exempt many men from paying a penalty for rape or seduction, even though explicitly mandated by the Torah. Moreover, as shown by a parallel statement in the Tosefta (3:8),<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">“A girl from the age of one day until [she shows the first signs of] puberty may be sold as a maidservant but <i>no</i> fine is paid by a man who rapes her…. The opinion of R. Meir…. But the Sages say: A girl from the age of one day and until the age of independence [full physical maturity, twelve and one-half], a fine <i>is</i> paid by the one who rapes her” (T 3:8). Rape penalties and the proceeds of the sale of a daughter as a maidservant are linked in that both are sums that the father receives for the “use” of his daughter.</i> the redactor of the Mishnah has codified the more restrictive view of R. Meir instead of the dissenting view of the Sages, who impose a fine in most cases of rape of a young girl. Some have claimed that this <i>mishnah</i> is evidence that the rabbis downplayed the gravity of sex crimes against women.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">Rachel Adler, “I’ve Had Nothing Yet So I Can’t Take More,” <i>Moment</i> 8 (September 1983): 22–26, writes that the rabbis neglect to ask how to hold the rapist of a little girl morally responsible for his behavior and how to compensate the young victim. The important question, she says, is how such things could happen. She further says that in a legal system in which a woman’s sexuality belongs to her father, such questions cannot arise. I disagree. The texts analyzed in this chapter indicate a growing rabbinic awareness of the suffering of the victim of rape and seduction.</i> But if we read these <i>mishnahs</i> in the context of the entire chapter, we see that the Mishnah’s aim is very specific: to limit sharply the circumstances in which it will be necessary for the rapist or seducer to pay the fine. But why would the rabbis wish to do that? That they impose restrictions in other cases, such as implementation of the death penalty and remission of debts in the sabbatical year, is understandable, given the obvious broad social benefits of interpreting those institutions out of existence. But why would they limit the scope of cases in which the rapist must pay a fine, in addition to damages, for the crime he committed? The fine, punishment above and beyond damages, makes this case different from others of personal injury. Releasing a man from paying it almost implies that he was not guilty of the crime of rape or seduction, only of damages that were incidental to the sexual act."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.22","If we backtrack for a moment and remind ourselves that the “fine,” a rabbinic term for the fifty silver shekels of the Torah, was paid to compensate the father for the loss of anticipated income from his daughter’s virginity, we realize that the fine had nothing to do with the criminality of the act. Therefore, the rabbis’ restriction of the fine should not be understood as overlooking her as victim, since the fine, like the other payments, was given not to her but to her father. In their eyes, payment of such a large amount to the father for a crime committed against the daughter must have seemed a travesty, especially since the bride-price was no longer paid, as already noted. If we read the other <i>mishnahs</i> of this chapter and the first <i>mishnah</i> of the next, we begin to notice that the fine was not eliminated but replaced by an alternative payment, <i>pegam</i>, and, perhaps even more important, that all rape and seduction payments were in the process of being reassigned from the father to the daughter."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.23","Before the broad implications of this passage are examined, the statement about how to assess the <i>pegam</i> payment requires explanation. In determining the amount to be paid for injury in a standard case of assault and battery, the rabbis say that the injured man (or woman) should be viewed as if for sale on the slave market. The amount to be paid corresponds to the difference in purchase price between a wholly intact individual and a handicapped or impaired one (M Baba Kama 8:1). Similarly here, to establish the “value” of a woman’s virginity, its differential price on the slave market has to be established. This does not imply that women are slaves to their husbands, in the sexual sense or in any other."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.24","<i>Pegam</i>, payment for personal injury, is almost always coupled with shame and appears in rabbinic literature almost exclusively in connection with seduction and rape.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">One exception is M Ketubot 6:1. Another can be found in PT Ketubot 5:5; 30a: “If one cuts off the hand of someone else’s slave, his master takes [from the one who did so] payment for injury, pain, shame, and <i>pegam</i>….”</i> It is interpreted by the Amoraim as payment for the loss of virginity, the critical injury suffered in these cases.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">– –“Said the father of Samuel: We estimate the difference between what a man would pay to have sex with a virgin slave and with a nonvirgin slave” (BT Ketubot 40b).</i> But if that is what it means, it is a different name for the fine, which also compensated the father for the loss of virginity. So why are two payments made for the same virginity? <i>Pegam</i>, as noted by the <i>mishnah</i>, is not fixed like the Torah’s fine, but variable, like the payment for shame. The level of payment varies with the victim’s socioeconomic circumstances. As the rabbis imply in M Arakhin 3:4, a fixed payment of fifty shekels can lead in some cases to paying too much, if she is of poor lineage and standing, and in others to paying too little, if she is of high social standing. So the rabbis, by virtually eliminating the fixed fifty-shekel fine and replacing it with their own variable payment, <i>pegam</i>, which can either exceed fifty or else go below it, show just how seriously they take the payments for rape and seduction: They insist that the payments correspond to the damage done, as is the rule in all cases of assault and battery. I must note, however, that allowing compensation for shame and loss of virginity to vary with family background is a concept that is foreign to most people today.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">Chapter 3 of M Arakhin reviews the various fixed payments prescribed by the Torah and examines those cases that lead to paying either more or less than the circumstances required. It seems that the rabbis, in general, opposed stipulated payments, which do not take socioeconomic standing into consideration, despite the democratic nature of such payments. Although in a number of <i>mishnahs</i> the rabbis themselves seem to say that all Jews are equally precious in God’s eyes (M BK 1:6), the other view, that social standing matters in assessment of damages, takes precedence.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.25","Furthermore, the rabbis begin to transfer sex crime payments from the father to the victim herself."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.26","The rule that this <i>mishnah</i> seeks to establish is that in certain circumstances the rapist or seducer pays damages to her and not to her father or to her brothers who are his heirs. If she went to court as a <i>bogeret</i>, an independent young woman, twelve and one-half years old or more, or if her father dies before the trial begins,<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Hebrew phrase is “if she stood trial” [<span dir=""rtl"">עמדה בדין</span>], which could be taken as saying that she, not he, is on trial. The suit is named for her because she brings it, not because she is tried.</i> the payments are made to her. We further learn that all moneys earned by or due her after she reaches maturity, either physically or because of her father’s death, accrue to her and no one else."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.27","It therefore seems to me that the rabbis, without their saying so explicitly, have made a significant statement about crimes against women: The woman is the victim and she deserves compensation. The value of a human being as a person independent of her family seems to have gained currency by the rabbinic period. Her consent is sought for marriage to the rapist. He is no longer, automatically, her husband. Payments that go to the father, which imply that he is the victim, and not she, are in the process of being eliminated, and payments for what she suffered are in the process of being developed and transferred to her. Moreover, by eliminating the fine from most cases of rape and seduction, the rabbis are saying that this fixed, biblically prescribed payment no longer makes legal sense: The new payments, for shame, pain, and personal injury, not referred to in the Torah in this context, are the ones that they are interested in establishing firmly. Less obvious, the rabbis understand that rape is something a man does to a woman, uninvited and hurtful. When these passages are read in context, they show that the rabbis have gone a long way to rectify the no-longer-appropriate indifference of the Bible to the young woman as victim."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.28",<b>Men’s Understanding of Women’s Pain</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.29","The Bavli’s commentary on M Ketubot 3:4, which introduces the payment for pain, is an attempt by men to grasp a woman’s experience in being raped."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.30","Samuel defines the pain payment of the <i>mishnah</i> as a reference to the pain suffered by the victim in being forced to submit. R. Zera expands it to include the pain of the forced sexual act itself. He relies on the view of the rabbis who disagree with R. Simon. In his cynical statement, R. Simon characterizes women’s pain in rape as not much different from the pain they suffer in the course of a consensual first sexual encounter. This means that, for him, forced and consensual sex are the same, that a virgin’s pain in rape is limited to the tearing of her hymen. His colleagues sharply rebuke him."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.31","Before examining the rest of the unit on pain, we will look at the parallel section in the Yerushalmi. It cites the same <i>baraita</i> to make the point that the Mishnah is <i>not</i> in accordance with R. Simon. That is, the Yerushalmi notes that the redactor of the Mishnah ignored R. Simon’s dismissive view of women’s pain in rape, accepting, instead, the Sages’ more sympathetic approach."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.32","R. Simon, in this version of the <i>baraita</i>, justifies his omission of a pain payment not only by pointing out that discomfort is inevitable in a first sexual encounter but also that—even in rape—it is negligible. The rabbis chide him for missing the point that, in addition to rupturing a hymen, there are other kinds of suffering that a raped virgin endures, including the psychological pain of degradation.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">The last part of the Yerushalmi <i>sugya</i> pursues R. Simon’s thinking further:<br>“How does R. Simon understand the biblical phrase <span dir=""rtl"">תחת אשר ענה</span> [which implies that she suffered pain]?<br>--R. Hisda refers it [R. Simon’s statement, <span dir=""rtl"">תפתר</span>] to a case in which he came upon her [sexually] on thorns [meaning that in such a case, according to R. Simon, he pays for the pain of the thorns but not for the pain of the first sexual act itself].”<br>We thus see that the Yerushalmi is shocked that R. Simon can assert that there is no pain associated with rape of a virgin, since the Torah explicitly says that there is. R. Hisda therefore comments that according to R. Simon the verse must be referring to the pain of the force he exerted in getting her to submit, throwing her down on a bed of thorns.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.33","This discussion by men of women’s pain in rape is of interest to women, in particular, since men, in many cultures, are skeptical about rape, not believing that women suffer during rape and not believing that women play no role in instigating this kind of abusive sexual attention. Here we find that the majority of rabbis understand that women suffer pain in rape. The point that rape is an act perpetrated on her against her will is summed up nicely in the following rather extreme statement:"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.34","According to this Amora, rape is rape, even if at some point it appears to be sanctioned by her, a conclusion diametrically opposed to the one reached by the author of the Temple Scroll, as mentioned above. Her alleged pleasure, despite the conditions of fear and brutality, does not mitigate, in any way, the fact of rape. Pleasure does not imply consent."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.35",The Bavli continues its discussion of women’s pain in rape:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.36","In this last section, men try to understand what women experience in their first sexual encounter when it is <i>not</i> forced upon them. Each of the rabbis quotes a woman, two their wives and one a nursemaid (whom he refers to as “Mother”). The pain described by all three women is minor and is expressed in terms that speak to men’s experience, too. By quoting women only, men recognize that the pain is real but that they cannot adequately describe it because they are men. The Bavli also reports, in the name of women but transmitted by a man, that a seduced woman does not suffer pain, which explains why the seducer does not pay for pain. This statement preaches: Since she “asked” for it, she deserves to suffer and we cannot show any sympathy for her. The women who say so are called “wise.” They appear to have internalized patriarchal values and, as a result, fail to recognize that seduction is a crime by men against women even if women, at some point, give their consent."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.37",<b>Creation of a New Legal Category: The <i>Bogeret</i></b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.38","The Bible never refers to a <i>bogeret</i>, an independent, physically mature young woman.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">I strongly disagree with Wegner, <i>Chattel or Person?</i> (14), who asserts that the Bible acknowledges such a status.</i> It consistently assumes that a girl who reaches puberty is married off by her father and passes from his authority to her husband’s without an interim period of independence.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">In the Bible she went from being a daughter in her father’s home, an unbetrothed young woman (Exod. 22:15; Deut. 22:28), to a betrothed young woman (Deut. 22:23, 25), to a wife in her husband’s home. Some <i>mishnahs</i> paint the same picture, e.g., Ketubot 4:5, but posit marriage prior to the time of physical maturity.</i> The rabbis present, or possibly invent, a third category: a girl who is under neither her father’s nor her husband’s authority. Today we call women (and men) who are in this category “single.” A distinguishing feature of the <i>bogeret</i>, as we will soon see, is that she has reached the age of consent. Her father may no longer arrange a marriage for her. She has to function on her own."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.39","Before drawing any legal conclusions, we must note the legal/literary dissonance in the first <i>mishnah</i>. A woman’s physical and sexual development is compared to that of a fig, the obvious underlying metaphor being that she ripens at puberty and is ready to be picked and eaten. A passage like this sees women as objects, not persons. But note that it is precisely at this point in her life that the Sages confer independence on her, making her responsible for her own sexuality. I cannot go so far as to call this move feminist, because she loses her new status as soon as she marries, but for the rabbis to make her independent just when she reaches sexual “ripeness” is remarkable."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.40","The principle emerging from these two <i>mishnahs</i> is that a girl is legally emancipated in two ways—by the death of her father or by reaching the age of physical maturity. When she reaches the age of twelve and one-half, she keeps the proceeds of her handicrafts, what she finds, and any payments due her, for instance from winning a court case. Also, since M Kiddushin 2:1 says that a father may betroth his daughter when she is a <i>na’arah</i> (between twelve and twelve and one-half), it implies that he may no longer do so when she passes that age.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">M Ketubot 4:4 says that a father is entitled to his daughter’s betrothal, be it by money or any other means. The commentators explain this to mean that he gets the betrothal money only for a girl that he is permitted to marry off, namely a <i>na’arah</i> (between twelve and twelve and one-half), but not for a <i>bogeret</i> (over twelve and one-half). He may not cancel her vows when she becomes a bogeret (M Nedarim 10:2).</i> Nor may he sell her as a maidservant even prior to that time, from twelve on (M Ketubot 3:8). Finally, if a girl is raped or seduced after twelve and one-half, the aggressor does not pay a fine. The reason given by the Gemara is that her hymen disappears on its own after she reaches physical maturity.<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">BT Yevamot 59a, <span dir=""rtl"">פרט לבוגרת שכלו לה בתוליה</span> … [except for a mature woman whose hymen disappears].</i> This means that she is legally no longer a virgin, even though she has never engaged in sexual relations. All these rules suggest that a woman is in control of her own affairs when she reaches maturity, provided she is not married.<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">There is one more way to achieve independence from her father at an even earlier age, and that is to have been married and then divorced (M Ketubot 4:2; see also 3:3, the opinion of R. Akiva).</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.41","Why did the rabbis create such a category, that of a young woman who is capable, upon reaching full physical and mental maturation, of functioning on her own? Granting an unmarried <i>bogeret</i> such extensive rights makes the important point that the reason she loses most of them upon marriage is not that she is not capable but that she comes under the aegis of a man. She remains competent but must cede all control to him; it is he who functions as sole head of household. Even so, the creation of such a category in a patriarchal society is a step in the direction of viewing women, although not wives, as independent legal personalities."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.42",<b>Sex with a Minor</b>
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.43","Contemporary readers are accustomed to linking the topic of sex crimes against women to the topic of sex between men and girls. In fact, the Talmud gives attention to relations both between men and girls and between women and boys. I will first consider the case of marital sex between an adult man and a girl less than twelve, sometimes even as young as three. Consent has no real meaning in such a case. The man’s behavior may appropriately be described as an act of forced sex. The Talmud makes a number of references to this kind of sexual connection and, at first reading, could be interpreted as condoning such behavior on the part of the man. But when we read those same statements in context, we see that they do not mean that the rabbis tolerated such relations. There is no one place in the Talmud that could be considered the locus classicus for a discussion of the topic of sex with a minor. The following set of sources, however, should provide us with some sense of the rabbis’ thinking on the subject. The main point we will glean from these texts is that one cannot deduce merely from the fact that a passage addresses the issue of sex between adults and minors that the particular passage or the Talmud in general sanctions such activity. As always, we will pay particularly close attention to the anecdotes interwoven among the prescriptive passages."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.44","This passage appears to be permitting—and even encouraging—a <i>kohen</i> to marry a very young girl, ostensibly because one can safely assume she is still a virgin. But the halakhic issue is not virginity per se. According to the rabbis, a woman who has sex with a man who is forbidden to her, such as a gentile, is called a <i>zonah</i> (not to be confused with the modern Hebrew word for prostitute), and is forbidden in marriage to a <i>kohen</i>. But several distinctions have to be made: If the sex act took place before she was three, it is of no lasting halakhic consequence because a hymen that was ruptured at such a young age, according to the rabbis, would repair itself.<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">I know of no scientific basis for this assertion.</i> Therefore, if she converts to Judaism <i>before</i> the age of three, then even if she had sex forced upon her as a very young child, prior to conversion, she is <i>not</i> considered a <i>zonah</i> and may marry a <i>kohen</i>. If she converts <i>after</i> she reached three, she is ineligible to marry a <i>kohen</i>, ever, because the rabbis assume she was sexually molested or active prior to conversion, when she was older than three, and hence a <i>zonah</i>. These are the rules that R. Simon deduces from Scripture. When understood in this way, this passage does not encourage marriage between <i>kohanim</i> and little girls. It merely notes the difference in marital eligibility to a <i>kohen</i> between girls who converted at a very young age and girls who converted a little later."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.45",The Bavli’s discussion of the topic ends with the following anecdote:
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.46","The wording of this passage gives the impression that it can be interpreted in two ways. One possibility is that a <i>kohen</i> married a very young girl and R. Nahman b. Isaac severely reprimanded him for doing so.<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">If she were very young, her father would have to give her in marriage. It is not clear that he could do so even if he converted at the same time that she did.</i> If so, the Amora adamantly opposes marriage with a minor. Alternatively, and more accurately, the passage is saying that a <i>kohen</i> married a woman who herself converted to Judaism before the age of three (and married him at some later time) and thus was not of Jewish stock on either her father’s or mother’s side. R. Nahman b. Isaac criticized the <i>kohen</i> for not going beyond what the law requires of him and marrying a woman with at least one Jewish parent. That the issue is lineage, not age, is supported by statements elsewhere in the Bavli and by a similar anecdote in the Yerushalmi.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">See BT Kiddushin 78b and PT Bikkurim 1:5; 64a. The Bavli passage deals with the issue of a <i>kohen</i> marrying a Jewish woman, both of whose parents are converts, and decides that, like the view of R. Yossi in M Kiddushin 4:7, it is acceptable. R. Nahman comments:<br>– –“Huna said to me that if a <i>kohen</i> comes to ask for advice, one should recommend that he adopt a personal stringency, as suggested by R. Eliezer b. Jacob [and only marry a woman who has at least one parent of Jewish stock]; if he had already married, we do not force him to divorce her, in accordance with R. Yossi.”</i> But either way we interpret the incident, we cannot find in it rabbinic approval of marriage with a very young girl."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.47",Another text that appears to address the topic of sex with a minor is a <i>mishnah</i> in Niddah.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.48","This <i>mishnah</i> discusses the legal consequences of sex with minors, of different ages and marital states, but does not sanction either marriage or sex with a very young girl. It says that until the age of three there is no legal outcome at all because the hymen returns and thus cancels the significance of the sex act. Putting a finger in the eye hurts and triggers tearing but does not usually cause permanent damage. After three, if a man has sex with a girl, not only does he cause her to lose her virginity permanently, but also—and precisely because of this—the sex act has a variety of legal consequences for both of them: for him, if she were forbidden to him, he will be punished in the same way as if she were a mature woman; for her, if the sexual relations were for the sake of marriage, they will make her a married woman. Just as forbidden sexual relations are not being encouraged by this <i>mishnah</i>, so, too, marriage to a minor is not being encouraged. In all instances, the consequences of such acts are the issue."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.49","The aim of this <i>mishnah</i> is to establish standards against which one can judge cases that arise. This <i>mishnah</i> is <i>not</i> saying that since an incestuous relationship with a girl over three is punishable by death<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">Or <i>karet</i> (see Chapter 7), depending on the precise relationship between the two participants.</i> but under three is not, men should limit their sexual attention to girls under three. On the contrary, all it is saying is that should any of these acts have taken place—for example, betrothal of a minor by means of sex or an act of incestuous or adulterous sex with her—since she had already reached the age of three, the act has legal consequences. The fact that the return of virginity delegitimizes prior acts of sex is clear evidence of a patriarchal outlook: A man can only establish “ownership” of a woman if he leaves his mark on her. Since sex acts prior to three are not traceable, a man cannot lay claim to a young girl."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.50","If we examine this <i>mishnah</i> in context, we see that in the preceding and following ones, the same kinds of topics arise, namely, what are the legal consequences of reaching different ages, such as one day for a boy or girl, three years for a girl, nine for a boy, twelve for a girl, thirteen for a boy, and so on. Just as the age of three is a turning point for a girl’s sexual status, so is nine for a boy."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.51","This <i>mishnah</i> parallels the preceding one in many ways. Again, sex with a minor is not being promoted here. All that is being said is that the sexual actions of a boy less than nine have no legal significance but that those of a boy over nine do, presumably because starting from that age and on he can maintain an erection and is thus capable of insemination. He is not encouraged to have sex with a woman who is forbidden to him; on the contrary, if such a woman has sex with him, she is subject to the same punishment as if she had committed an act of incest or adultery with a grown man."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.52",The Bavli’s discussion of the mishnah about a three-year-old girl ends with two anecdotes that indicate that sex with minors was not unknown in the ancient world.
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.53","In both of these anecdotes women speak positively about the sex that they had while still very young, in the first case at the age of six and in the second before the age of three. The first woman is an aristocratic Roman and the second Jewish. In the second instance, the woman suggests that she was forced into a sexual act as a very young child but, after experiencing it several times, came to like it. It goes without saying that the men who had sex with her did so of their own free will and derived pleasure from it."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.54","Is the Talmud, by means of these anecdotes, sanctioning sex with minors? The first is typical of rabbinic literature in that it attributes a strong libido to non-Jews and also upholds what the rabbis say about them in many different places, that they behave promiscuously and that one may assume that a non-Jewish girl over the age of three is sexually experienced. The unique aspect of this passage is that the woman herself reports that her sexual encounters as a young girl were pleasurable. But this anecdote does not necessarily have implications for Jews."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.55","The second story is much more striking and even chilling. It seems to be saying that even under conditions of near rape, a very young girl can learn to enjoy sex. Nonetheless, I do not think that this anecdote is promoting sex with children. It is raising the possibility that exploitative sexual relations, such as those between an adult and a child, can still be, on a physical level, pleasurable to the child. The point remains, however, that, unlike the first story in which the girl wishes she had sought sex at a very young age, in the second instance, the woman who reports the incident does not appear to be advocating it, only remarking upon it. As noted earlier in this chapter, there are men who hold that women, despite the presence of force and intimidation, may derive physical pleasure from rape (Rava, BT Ketubot 51b). That is not an endorsement of rape by men (or women)."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.56","The woman in this second anecdote seems to be mocking the rabbis, claiming that their standard of a three-year-old girl’s sexual readiness for marriage is meaningless. This is like the Roman woman’s challenging the rabbis’ assertion that pregnancy cannot be achieved until a girl reaches twelve. The Jewish woman’s almost seductive use of the “finger in honey” metaphor—and “finger” in this very tractate is used to denote the male sexual organ—paints her as someone who virtually flaunts her lack of inhibition in both discussing sex and engaging in it. A likely reason she came to them and divulged the details of her sexual past was to challenge them and their pedantic analysis of topics that they are removed from and that she is, regrettably, caught up in. If so, she is saying that they have no understanding of the cruel facts of her childhood and, presumably, that of many other women. While she was suffering repeated acts of forced sex at the hands of men, other men were convening and dispassionately analyzing the legal consequences of the rapists’ actions.<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. Judith Plaskow (<i>Standing Again at Sinai</i> [San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1990], 69), who says that “the delights of legal argumentation can lead to a certain distance from the concrete world of people and things.” See also PT Sotah 4:4; 19d.</i>"
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.57","In all, we will see four stories in which rabbis issue pronouncements about women’s biology—two here in Niddah and two more in Yevamot 34b, where the rabbis say that a woman who abstains from sexual activity for ten years will not be able to achieve pregnancy—and in which the women themselves demonstrate the falseness of these assertions. The women’s attitude to the rabbis in all four anecdotes is derisive in varying degrees. Since men told these stories about women to other men and the redactor of the Talmud included them in the corpus, I think we can say that they represent a “countertradition”:<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">As defined by llana Pardes, <i>Countertraditions in the Bible</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992). See Introduction herein, note 21.</i> They show opposition by women—and men—to the regnant patriarchal order, at least in the sense that women are telling men that they do not fully understand women’s bodies and biology, although the men think they do."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.58","The second part of the story is also hard to understand. Why does R. Akiva change his halakhic decision in response to the woman’s admitting that she enjoyed sex as a young child? Why would her pleasure play a role in determining whether or not she is later fit for a <i>kohen</i>, since her ruptured hymen will repair and she will no longer be a <i>zonah</i> by the time she is ready for marriage? Does he think that sex accompanied by pleasure taints her for future marriage to a <i>kohen</i>, even if she is technically no longer a <i>zonah?</i> And why do his students respond so strongly to his decision, claiming that this rule, that a girl under three who had sex is still fit for a <i>kohen</i> once she returns to a virginal state and cannot, therefore, be considered a <i>zonah</i>, is an ancient Jewish law, just like the rest of the Torah? They seem extraordinarily protective of a <i>kohen</i>’s freedom to marry a woman whose sexual past, prior to the age of three, is unknowable. It is the hymen that counts, not the girl’s sexual history. These rabbis appear to deny the existence of that which they cannot know."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.59","We also find references to women and sexual activity with young boys. A <i>baraita</i> on this topic appears in the Tosefta, the Bavli, and the Yerushalmi."
"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, Rape and Seduction.60","This same <i>baraita</i> appears in the Yerushalmi (PT Gittin 8:10, 49c) in the context of a <i>mishnah</i> that reports a dispute between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel about a woman’s eligibility to marry a <i>kohen:</i> Bet Shammai says that even if all a man did was prepare a <i>get</i> for his wife but not deliver it, she is not fit to marry a <i>kohen</i> should her husband then die. Bet Hillel says she is. The Yerushalmi then brings the same baraita as above, replacing the word <i>meSaLeLet</i> with <i>meSaLeDet</i>.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">This verb appears differently in the various texts. Either it changes so often because it is not commonly used and was therefore unrecognizable to the transmitters or else the action described is so abhorrent to the transmitter that he alters the text somewhat. The root S-L-L means to rub. The root S-L-D means to shrink back, sometimes in disgust.</i> The debated point is similar to the one in the <i>mishnah:</i> Does an incomplete sexual act disqualify her in the same way that a complete act does? Is genital contact with a male who is forbidden to her to be considered equivalent to sexual relations with him? The second part of the <i>baraita</i> in the Yerushalmi, which does not appear in the Tosefta, speaks of women who mutually arouse each other, <i>meSoLeLot</i>—the same verb as in the first part of the <i>baraita</i>—and addresses the question of their being fit to marry <i>kohanim</i>.<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">It does not seem that the <i>baraita</i> speaks of lesbians but of women, perhaps married, who sport with each other for pleasure.</i> The issue is similar: Does a woman’s sexual act with another woman, that is, an incomplete act from a man’s point of view, have legal standing? Does it disqualify her from marrying a <i>kohen</i> the way sex with a man forbidden to her would? Bet Shammai says that it does, and Bet Hillel says that it does not.<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">Cf. BT Yevamot 76a, where R. Huna says that women who engage in this kind of sexual activity (<i>meSoLeLot</i>) are unfit to be married to a <i>kohen</i>. See also BT Shabbat 65a.</i>"
