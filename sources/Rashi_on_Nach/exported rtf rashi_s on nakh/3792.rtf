\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ furnace and hastens back to enter. So, when they would thrust their heads out from under the expanse 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that was extended above themas is delineated in the chapterthey would recoil because of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Shechinah, which is above the expanse, and they hasten to pull their heads [down]. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ like the

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ color of the fire that emanates from between the shards within which gold is refined in a furnace. The 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ fire that emanates from there is colored with these colors (ibid.). [AddendumOthers explain \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ äÇáÌÈæÈ÷\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  as an 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ expression of scattering, as our Sages explained it (Gen. Rabbah 50:1): “like the appearance of the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ bazak” R. Judah in the name of R. Simon in the name of R. Levi the son of Perata: Like one who 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ scatters \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (äÇáÌåÉæÅ÷)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  ‘gefeth’ in a stove, i.e., he scatters ‘gefeth’ the residue of olives in a stove: it ignites 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ quickly and raises a flame, and the flame ascends and descends, and this is the meaning of “would run 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and return.” Furthermore we find in their words (Sanh. 108b, according to Aruch) \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ áæ÷\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  used as an 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ expression of scattering: “He scattered \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (áÌÈæÇ÷)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  dust on them and it turned into swords,” meaning he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ scattered, and so in the Mishnah (Eruvin 10:14): “We may scatter \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (áÌåÉæÀ÷Äéï)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  salt on the ramp so that they
