Ps. 16:1): Of David, who was poor \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (מך)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ perfect \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ותם)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , whose wound \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (מכתו)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  was perfect \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (תמה)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , for he was born circumcised. However, the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ sequence of the verse here does not lend itself to be interpreted according to the Midrash. There are 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ psalms prefaced by the title \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ לדוד מכתם\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , which may be interpreted: This song is David’s, who was poor 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and perfect, but here, where it is stated \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ מכתם לדוד\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , it cannot be interpreted in this manner. I therefore 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ say that it is one of the names of the various types of melodies and the variations in the music. Another 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ explanation: \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ מכתם\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  is an expression of a crown, like \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ כתם\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , meaning that David was accustomed to say, “O 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ God, guard me for I have taken refuge in You.” And this was to him as a crown, as it is stated (5: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 13): “You shall crown him with will.”
