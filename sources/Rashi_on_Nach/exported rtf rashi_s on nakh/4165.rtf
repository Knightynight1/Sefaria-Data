\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ say that this is said concerning Hezekiah, who rejoiced about the emissaries of Merodach-baladan (Isa. 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 39, II Kings 20), and he fed them at his table and showed them his entire treasure house. This 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ resembles the prophetís statement (verse 14), ìmen engraved on the wall,î because they came from a

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ etc.,î and in (II) Chronicles (32:25): ìBut Hezekiah did not pay back according to the benefit they had
