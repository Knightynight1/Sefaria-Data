\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Eruvin (14b) “The three lower ones were square and the two upper ones were round,” and it will be

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ritual baths of purity containing forty measures (of \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ñàä\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ) [in each], except in this manner explained by 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ our Sages in Eruvin. It is impossible to say the upper ones were square and the lower ones round, for it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is written “its brim was round all about” (7:23) [indicating it was the top which was round]. He, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ therefore, says by these knops “for ten cubits compassing the sea round about” because in the place 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ that it was square, a perimeter of forty cubits has ten cubits on each side, but in the place that it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ round it is impossible to say it has ten cubits on each side around. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ The knops were cast in two rows, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ when it was cast\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Everything, [the sea and the knops,] was poured together. [It was] not [made in a 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ manner] that he attached the knops to it after they had been poured, through nails or through soldering 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which is called soldedure; soudure in O.F.
