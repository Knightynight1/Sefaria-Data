The 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ place where she girded herself, there will be lacerated, cut with wounds and signs of blows, as (Job: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 19:26): “And after my skin is cut to pieces \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ğÄ÷ÌÀôåÌ)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  ”; (infra 10:34) “and the thickets of forest shall be cut

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to (Daniel 5:6): “knocked one against the other \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (ğÇ÷ÀùÑÈï)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ .” I would explain it as follows: The place where 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ they would put the plates of gold made by hammering batdec in O.F.but it is vowelized in the Masorah 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ among the ten words vowelized with a ‘pattach’ [i.e., a ‘segol,’ and none of them is connected to the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ following word, and every [instance of the word] that is in the construct state is vowelized with 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ a ‘kamatz’ [i.e., a ‘tzeireh’]. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ and in the place of the organ of levity\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Heb. \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ åÀúÇçÇúôÌÀúÄéâÄéì\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ . This is like two 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ words: \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ôÌÀúÄé âÄéì\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , a vessel [or organ] that brings levity; the secret parts about which is mentioned above: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ shall pour out their ‘vessels.’ Instead of that levity, a girdle of sackcloth will be on all loins. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ for this is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ instead of beauty\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  For this is fitting for them to have instead of the beauty with which they acted 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ haughtily.
