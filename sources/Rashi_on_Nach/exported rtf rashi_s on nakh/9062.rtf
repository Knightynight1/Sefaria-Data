\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ fit to he hidden in the dust, for they were despised among the nations, about whom it is said (Isa. 23: 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ 13): ìthis people has never been,î and they ruled over the Temple of the Holy One, blessed be He, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which is a holy place, and when they went from there to their land, they boasted that they did such 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and such a thing in the Temple of the Omnipresent. Do not read \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Â¿Èƒ˘—¿˙Ã«ÎÃ¿ÁÂÃ\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , and they will be forgotten, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ but \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Â¿Èƒ˘—¿˙Ã«·Ã¿ÁÂÃ\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , and they will boast. So did our Rabbis of blessed memory expound it (Gittin 56b). 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Concerning the forgetting, [i.e., the legitimate wording of the verse], it is expounded as follows in the 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Aggadah (unknown): and ultimately, their name and their remembrance will be forgotten from that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ very city, that they did so therein, as it is said (Joel 4:2): ìI will gather all the nations and I will take 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.î In the place where they angered Him, He will mete out 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ retribution upon them, and so Scripture states (Ps. 73:20): ìO Lord, in the city You will despise their 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ form.î \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ this too\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  is one of the vanities that were given to the world to weary mankind, for the Holy One, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ blessed be He, does not hasten to mete out retribution upon evildoers, and mankind thinks that there is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ neither judgment nor Judge.
