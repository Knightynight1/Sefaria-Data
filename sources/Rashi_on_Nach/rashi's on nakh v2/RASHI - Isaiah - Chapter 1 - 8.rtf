\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ midst, as a hut in a vineyard, made by a watchman, and when the produce of the vineyard is gathered, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ he leaves his hut and goes away, after they gather it. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ like a lodge in a cucumber field\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  As the lodge, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ which the watchman made at the end of a cucumber field, to watch its cucumber, is left, for after it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ gathered, he leaves it and goes away; the one in the vineyard is called a hut since he lives in it day and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ night; by day, he guards it from the birds and by night from the thieves, b ut cucumbers are hard, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ there is no fear of the birds, and one need not watch them by day. It is, therefore, called a lodge since 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ it is a place of lodging at night. Jonathan renders: Like a bed in a lodge (again repeated in Hebrew), 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [in] a cucumber field, in a cucumber field after it has been picked \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (·Ã»˙«¯ „¿‡«·¿Ú»ÈÂÃ‰ƒÈ)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , after it has been 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ picked. [This is the expression of the Mishnah] (Peah 4:5): ìThere are three gatherings \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (‡«·¿Ú»ÈÂ…˙)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  a

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ troops, and when they give up the siege [lit., when they go away from it], they leave them and go 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ away. All this is Jonathanís translation.
