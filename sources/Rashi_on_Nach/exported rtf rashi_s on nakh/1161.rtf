Did not Merab hear them? We conclude that 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Merab bore them but Michal raised them and they therefore were called after her name; for one who 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ raises an orphan in his house is as if he had begotten them and he is called after his name.
