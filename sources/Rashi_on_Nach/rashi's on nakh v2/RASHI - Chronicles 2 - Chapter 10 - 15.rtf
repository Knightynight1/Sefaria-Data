\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ delineated in I Kings (11:31–37), to remove from him the ten tribes and to give them to Jeroboam, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ this is the meaning of (Gen. 49:10): “The scepter will not depart from Judah” [meaning that] he will 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ not be banished from his kingdom, “until he comes to Shiloh,” meaning until Judah comes to Shiloh to 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ crown Rehoboam there, and there “peoples will gather to him” to crown him, and there the kingdom 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ was divided, and the reign over the ten tribes was lost. Now Shechem is a small city adjacent to Shiloh, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ as it is written at the end of Judges (21:19): “Behold, there is a sacrifice before the Lord in Shiloh from 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ time to time, etc. on the east side of the highway that goes up from Beth-El to Shechem,” and it is 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ written in Jeremiah (41:5): “from Shechem (and) from Shiloh,” and in honor of the Tabernacle of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Shiloh, they would gather in Shechem, which was fit for the people to assemble in, and it adjoined 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Shiloh. And when they would assemble in Shechem, the scepter would depart from Judah, for there 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ the kingdom was divided.
